The appellant was convicted on a charge of abetting by instigation the commission of housebreaking and theft by night, contrary to s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with s 34. The persons the appellant were alleged to have abetted were Narendran s/o Govindaraj (PW5), Ramesh s/o Ramachandra (Ramesh), Suraj Babu s/o Mndraju (DW2), Selvam s/o Munusamy (also known as Veera) and one Subramaniam (Steven). The theft took place on 7 September 1992 at about 1am at the British Club. I will refer to this incident as the `British Club break-in`.
 The prosecution`s evidence
The prosecution relied solely on PW5`s testimony. PW5 is currently serving six years` corrective training for a series of offences. On 19 December 1992, he pleaded guilty to the British Club break-in, together with some other offences. He was, on that occasion, sentenced to a total of four years and four months` imprisonment. There was no mention of the appellant in the statement of facts which he admitted to on that occasion. In that statement of facts, he had agreed that the burglary was planned by Steven. PW5 said that he implicated the appellant in 1996 because he had `a guilty conscience` and that it `was not fair` that the appellant had escaped unpunished.
On 3 June 1996, PW5 was arrested by the police on suspicion of a housebreaking at a building known as the Leksun Industrial Building which occurred the previous day. He also implicated the appellant in that break-in, which I will refer to as the `Leksun break-in`. It was common ground that the appellant had nothing to do with that offence. The appellant was arrested on the same day as a result of PW5`s accusation. The only explanation PW5 proferred for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in was that he was confused because he faced seven other charges at the time.
PW5 first met the appellant sometime in the middle of 1992. The appellant was a security guard at BP Singapore Pte Ltd when PW5 started work there. A few days later, the appellant was transferred to another location. They kept in touch with each other over the phone.
According to PW5, the appellant telephoned him and asked him if he was interested in breaking into the British Club. The appellant gave him the details concerning the location of the British Club and what items could be found there. The appellant told PW5 that Steven would give him the details of how it was to be done. One or two days later, Steven went alone to PW5`s workplace. PW5 said that this was not the first time that he met Steven. They discussed the break-in in a taxi when they left. Steven suggested a date but said that he wanted to discuss with the appellant first. Steven also said that he would check with the appellant concerning other details.
The next day, PW5 talked to Ramesh and DW2 about the planned burglary. They were initially reluctant but eventually agreed to participate. Ramesh and DW2 were good friends of PW5. PW5`s evidence was that he told them that the appellant provided the information about the British Club.
A few days later, PW5 went to the appellant`s office. Steven was also present. The appellant told PW5 that there were no close-circuit television cameras inside the British Club. The appellant told him that the burglary would take place on 7 September 1992. Only the three of them were present at this meeting. I noted, however, that PW5 said in cross-examination at one stage that this was the first time he discussed the break-in at the British Club with Steven, though he subsequently reverted to his original position.
After this meeting, PW5 kept in constant touch with Steven, who supplied implements such as false number plates for a van, a crow-bar, a cutter and a few screwdrivers. Steven told PW5 to meet him between 7pm and 8pm at Lorong Ampas. PW5 obtained the vehicle used in the burglary because Steven was unable to do so. However, Steven backed out at the last minute and told them that his cousin, Veera, would take his place. PW5 telephoned the appellant to ask about this, and was told that all would go on as planned, just as Steven had said.
PW5 described in detail the break-in. In a nutshell, PW5, Ramesh, DW2 and Veera made off with a large quantity of coins from the British Club`s jackpot machines. They drove to Jalan Ampas, where DW2`s father worked, and deposited the stolen coins in a small room at the back of the building. Their intention was to wait for Steven`s instructions.
PW5 contacted Steven the next day. Steven said that he would call the appellant and let PW5 know what to do. Later, Steven called and said that he would be there in the evening to help them count the coins. PW5 telephoned the appellant and told him what Steven said. The appellant said that he knew about this and that he would be there as well.
Ramesh and DW2 arrived at about 5pm that evening. The appellant came later in a taxi. However, Steven did not turn up. The four of them started to count the coins but gave up because there were too many. Instead, they packed them in `Ziploc` bags and divided the bags. The appellant took two bags of one dollar coins and told them that Steven would be coming later to collect his and Veera`s share.
The next day, PW5 telephoned the appellant and asked why Steven had not collected the money. The appellant reassured PW5 that nothing would go wrong. The appellant also asked PW5 not to implicate him if something was to go wrong. PW5 agreed. He related this to Ramesh and DW2. They too agreed not to implicate the appellant.
Steven did not collect his money, so PW5 told DW2 and Ramesh that they would set aside Steven`s and Veera`s share, and that they could take theirs. Ramesh was later arrested, apparently because he got into an argument with a taxi-driver. The next day, PW5 was arrested.
The investigating officer gave evidence that Steven is deceased. Steven had been arrested in 1992 but had not been charged for the British Club break-in. It was not possible to ascertain the reason for this, because the investigating officer for that case had also passed away. All that could be said was that Steven had been charged with and was convicted of another offence. A British Club representative testified that the British Club did not have any close-circuit television cameras in September 1992.
 The defence
The appellant`s defence was a denial. His evidence was that there was one occasion before 7 September 1992 when Steven met PW5 at the appellant`s workplace. Steven`s father worked nearby and PW5 used to go to the appellant`s workplace for drinks. The appellant introduced Steven to PW5. The appellant said that he overheard the two of them talking about the British Club when he returned from his rounds. He did not know what the discussion was about.
Sometime around 7 September 1992, the appellant received a call from Steven. Steven asked him to go to a coffee shop at Balestier Road. Steven said that he wanted to talk to the appellant. The appellant asked him what it was about, but Steven said that he could not talk about it over the phone.
The appellant took a taxi to the coffee-shop. Steven and PW5 were there, together with another man whom he could not recall. They had some food and beer. Then the appellant asked Steven why he asked him to go there. Steven and PW5 took him to a small room in a building opposite the coffee-shop. There were coins heaped on the floor. Steven asked the appellant if he could help to change the coins to notes. The appellant replied that they could be changed at the bank and told him not to call the appellant again at his workplace.
The appellant denied instigating PW5 to commit the housebreaking. He denied providing information about the British Club, planning the housebreaking or taking any of the money. He also did not know Ramesh, DW2 or Veera. He did not know why PW5 implicated him.
DW2 had served his sentence for the British Club break-in. He testified that he was never told by PW5 of the appellant`s involvement in the break-in. PW5 had merely told him that PW5, Steven, Ramesh and himself were involved. DW2 did not know Steven until PW5 introduced him to DW2. DW2 did not speak to Steven. PW5 only told him that Steven planned the break-in. PW5 never said anything about the appellant.
DW2 had only seen the appellant once at Lorong Ampas. This was after the break-in. He did not notice whether the appellant took any money when he left. He did not know what was discussed as they were speaking in Tamil. DW2 had not seen the appellant again.
During cross-examination, DW2 confirmed that the agreement was that they would share the money from the break-in equally. He was not sure whether the appellant was involved in counting the coins. The appellant merely volunteered to change the coins. DW2 also explained that he might have said to the investigating officer on 10 June 1996 that the appellant was present and gave information on how to execute the plan for the break-in because it was not clear in his mind who Steven and the appellant were at the time. He had thought that the appellant was Steven and vice versa. It was only in court that he saw that the appellant was not Steven. It had been a very long time since he last saw them.
 The finding below
The district judge was aware that for the purpose of this trial, PW5 was an accomplice. However, the district judge was satisified that PW5 was a truthful witness. He held:
 
When [PW5] testified I observed his demeanour closely particularly during the cross-examination. His account of the facts and surrounding circumstances relating to the break-in at the British Club was clear and consistent. He was unshaken in cross-examination. There was no reason for the court to disbelieve his testimony when he had already served sentence for the British Club break-in and he gained nothing from testifying against the accused. The defence also did not suggest any motive on the part of [PW5] for his testimony.
 
 
 
The district judge was of the view that there was corroboration of PW5`s evidence that the appellant had told him that there was no close-circuit television cameras at the British Club. The district judge accepted PW5`s explanation for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in. He held:
 
However [PW5] explained that the mistake was due to a confusion whilst being interrogated. He however promptly rectified his mistake and the accused was not charged in connection with the Leksun robbery. I accepted this as an honest mistake.
 
 
 
The district judge had no difficulty in accepting PW5`s evidence that he was easing his conscience by informing the police about the appellant`s involvement.
On the other hand, the district judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence. It was difficult for him to believe that Steven and PW5 would hatch a plot to burgle the British Club upon being introduced. It was also difficult for him to believe that the appellant would leave his post and take a taxi at his expense to Jalan Ampas at Steven`s request just to be shown coins and to be consulted on whether the appellant could help to change them into notes. He was of the view that the fact that the appellant rushed down from his place of work showed his involvement in the robbery. Furthermore, DW2 had said that the appellant volunteered to change the coins, whilst the appellant said that he had told them to go to the bank.
As for DW2`s evidence, it did not assist the appellant. That Steven told PW5 of the location of the break-in did not exonerate the appellant from being a planner. In any case, DW2 appeared to the district judge to be a reluctant witness.
In the event, the district judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. He convicted the appellant and sentenced him to four years` imprisonment.
 The appeal
For this appeal, I constantly bore in mind the fact that the conviction was based solely on the testimony of PW5, an accomplice. In this context, s 116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) must be given real effect, and not merely recited. I also kept in mind the fact that PW5 had not in any manner implicated the appellant when he pleaded guilty to the offence in 1992. In addition, he had also wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in, which occurred in 1996, before he implicated the appellant in the British Club break-in.
The district judge was of the view that PW5`s testimony was unshaken by cross-examination. With respect to the district judge, it was not altogether clear what the district judge meant by this. If he meant that PW5 had not retracted his evidence, that was obviously too much to ask for. If he meant that PW5`s evidence withstood cross-examination, then I disagreed.
Firstly, PW5 had not given any credible explanation as to why he had wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in. His answer was a convenient `I was confused`. There was no explanation proffered as to how and why he was confused. PW5 had just been released from prison after serving terms for, inter alia, the British Club break-in. He was arrested for the Leksun break-in, which occurred some four years later after his release from prison. According to him, he was also being interrogated in relation to seven other charges. However, the fact remained that the Leksun break-in was committed by PW5 the day before his arrest. I was unable to fathom how he could be confused to the extent of accusing the appellant of being involved in it.
The emptiness of PW5`s evidence that he was confused could be compared vividly with DW2`s explanation of how DW2 was confused. DW2 accepted that he might have told the investigating officer in 1996 that the appellant planned the British Club break-in. His explanation of this was cogent. He had only met the appellant once, and that was four years ago. Likewise, he had not seen Steven for four years. He had thought that the appellant was Steven. That was why he corrected himself when he saw in court that the appellant was not Steven. It was a reasonable and acceptable explanation. PW5`s explanation, on the other hand, was bereft of content.
The bareness of PW5`s explanation also raised numerous doubts. Many questions remain unanswered. In what context did PW5 first mention the appellant? How did it come about that he mentioned the appellant? If the interrogation was sufficiently vigorous for PW5 to be so fundamentally confused, how reliable could what he said be?
Contrary to what the district judge said, there did not appear to be any indication at all in the records that the appellant was not charged with the Leksun break-in because PW5 corrected himself. It appeared just as likely that the appellant was not charged because further investigation revealed that the accusation was false. It was a crucial distinction whether PW5 corrected himself, if at all, before or after investigations revealed that the appellant was not involved in the Leksun break-in. The two alternatives would throw very different light on the complexion of the whole case. In the latter scenario, there would be very plausible reasons why PW5 would want to implicate the appellant falsely, namely, that his initial lie was found out. It cannot be over-emphasised that PW5 had wrongly or falsely implicated the appellant on the very day of his arrest.
Secondly, regarding PW5`s reason for implicating the appellant now, some four years later, PW5 said that this was to ease his conscience. With respect to the district judge, considering that PW5 was a person who embarked on a series of housebreaking so soon after his release from prison, his claim of being conscience-stricken sounded empty. PW5`s evidence appeared to be that if he had not been arrested again, he would not have been bothered by his conscience!
I was of the view PW5`s statement that `it is not fair` gave a better insight into the state of his mind at the relevant time. It revealed his desire that the appellant should be imprisoned. As for what was not fair, it may be that it was as the appellant said, that it was because the appellant was never punished even though he was the mastermind of the British Club break-in. On the other hand, it could be anything else. Whatever it was, it seemed that it was only unfair because the appellant was arrested for the Leksun break-in. In my view, it was very dangerous to rely on his testimony.
Thirdly, PW5`s evidence was not wholly consistent. He had said in examination-in-chief that after the appellant instigated him to commit the break-in over the phone, Steven went to PW5`s workplace and they discussed about the planned break-in. Subsequently, they went to the appellant`s workplace where they again discussed the break-in. However, in his cross-examination, PW5 said that the first time he discussed the break-in with Steven was at the appellant`s workplace. This was a material contradiction. This is because PW5`s evidence was that the appellant told PW5 that he would send Steven over to see PW5 to discuss the details of the planned break-in.
More importantly, PW5`s evidence was not consistent at all with DW2`s. In this context, it was highly relevant that DW2 and PW5 were friends. On the other hand, DW2 hardly knew the appellant at all. If it was the case that PW5 had finally decided to bare all about the appellant`s involvement, there was little reason for DW2 to be a `reluctant witness`. If PW5 was to be believed, the reason why DW2 did not implicate the appellant was because PW5 asked him not to. That reason no longer existed.
In any event, considering that the agreement was that the participants share the spoils equally, it seemed highly improbable that PW5 would not have told Rameesh and DW2 that there was an additional person who would be sharing the loot. This would be so no matter how disinterested DW2 could have been in the details of the planned break-in. The contrary position, which even PW5 did not suggest in his evidence, would have bordered on the inherently incredible.
Looked at in this light, DW2`s evidence that the appellant had volunteered to change the coins into notes paled into insignificance compared to his evidence on the bigger picture of his lack of knowledge that the appellant was involved in the break-in. The former was at best a minor inconsistency. The latter was a material contradiction.
Counsel for the defence had, undoubtedly, conceded that DW2`s evidence was neither here nor there. However, bearing in mind what I have said about his evidence, I was of the firm view that this concession was wrongly made. Despite the unsatisfactory state of DW2`s evidence, the major points in his testimony were most telling. The district judge ought to have examined them more carefully.
Lastly, I found it difficult to understand how the British Club representative`s evidence could be corroboration of any part of PW5`s evidence, apart from the fact that PW5 knew that there was no close-circuit television at the club. PW5 could have acquired that knowledge from any person. There was also no explanation as to how the appellant came to know so much about the British Club.
It is settled law that when a trial judge makes a finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb the finding. Reference may be made to 
Teo Ai Choo v Leng Sze Hian
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 331
  ; 
[1986] SLR 75
 and 
PP v Victor Rajoo s/o A Pitchay Muthu
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
  .
However, it is equally settled law that an impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. This salutory caution was stated by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
Tara Sing& Ors v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  . That case was approved in 
PP v Yeoh Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
  , and by the Court of Appeal in 
 PP v Victor Rajoo 
. Likewise, a finding on a witness`s credibility must be tested against known objective facts and evidence.
For the reasons I have stated, it cannot be said that PW5`s evidence was so compelling that a conviction could be based solely on it. The circumstance in which he came to implicate the appellant was suspect, as was his motive. His evidence was neither consistent, nor did it square with the account given by his accomplice, DW2. In this context, if PW5 had no reason to lie, DW2 had even less reason to do so. There were important gaps in the prosecution`s case. Tested against the whole of his evidence, and the known objective facts and evidence, PW5`s testimony fell far short.
Turning to the appellant`s defence, it is also trite law that an accused should not be convicted merely because his defence is tenuous or because the trial judge disbelieves his defence. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will deal with the district judge`s findings on this. In my view, the district judge appeared to have misconstrued the appellant`s evidence on at least two material instances.
Firstly, it was never the appellant`s evidence that PW5 and Steven hatched a plan to break into the British Club when they first met at the appellant`s workplace. The appellant`s evidence was that he overheard them talking about the British Club. This was a completely different thing from saying that they were discussing how to break into the British Club. No doubt, counsel for the appellant had put to PW5 that PW5 and Steven discussed the British Club break-in on that occasion, but that was hardly the same thing as the appellant`s testimony. By the same token, the prosecuting officer had put to DW2 that DW2, PW5, the appellant, Steven and Ramesh held discussions prior to the British Club break-in, even though it was never PW5`s evidence that such a discussion involving so many persons ever took place before the break-in.
In any event, even if this part of the appellant`s evidence was untrue, and the appellant never overheard them talking about the British Club, it still did not take the prosecution`s case very far. The appellant`s recollection of when the meeting took place was unlikely to be reliable. The appellant was describing an event that took place four years ago.
Secondly, it was not the appellant`s evidence that he took a taxi from work to see Steven just to be asked whether he could change coins into notes. His evidence was that Steven asked him to meet him and that it concerned something that should not be discussed over the phone. It seemed to me that to any reasonable person, this amounted to saying that it was something important, which would have justified the appellant leaving work and taking a taxi to meet Steven. Likewise, I was unable to see anything peculiar about Steven`s request that the appellant meet him.
In addition, there was hardly any reason for the appellant to have rushed down to the coffee shop if what PW5 said was true. The break-in had occurred the previous night, and according to PW5, the appellant was informed the following morning. The appellant only went to the coffee shop near Jalan Ampas in the evening.
In conclusion, even though I did not have the benefit of assessing PW5`s demeanor, I was satisfied that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction. The conviction was unsafe. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.",1997-05-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

Damien John Simpson (the accused) appeals against an order of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania 
    [1]
   which dismissed his appeal against a conviction for murder. He contends that his conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the Crown failed to tender any evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that he killed the deceased ""by means of [an] unlawful act  which [he] knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances""
                     
    [2]
  . Alternatively, he contends that the conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the circumstances that could be taken into account in determining whether the accused ought to have known that his act was likely to cause death. He also contends that the judge's directions to the jury effectively reversed the onus of proof as to those circumstances.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 13 November 1996).

                           
Criminal Code Act 1924 
                           Tas, s 157(1)(c).



               

The charge of murder was laid under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code Act 1924 
                     Tas (the Criminal Code). That paragraph provides:Subject to the provisions of section 160, culpable homicide is murder if it is committed —
                           
                           
(c) by means of any unlawful act or omission which the offender knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances, although he had no wish to cause death or bodily harm to any person.

                           
                        

                     

                  


               

The accused was tried before a judge and a jury of twelve in the Supreme Court of Tasmania 
    [3]
  . At the trial, the Crown tendered evidence that in June 1995, the accused killed Anthony William Smith by stabbing him in the neck with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade. From the evidence, the jury was entitled to conclude that, after an altercation had started between two groups, the accused ran across the road to the footpath and struck the deceased who was a member of one of the groups. Friends of the accused were in the other group. None of the eye witnesses saw the accused with a knife. One eye witness said that the accused ""just raised his hand and it looked like he had hit one of the fellows""; another said that the accused ""brought it down as in a hitting motion like he punched him"". But in a record of interview and in his evidence the accused admitted that he had stabbed the deceased with the knife. Medical evidence established that the deceased had been stabbed in the left side of the neck just above the collarbone. The entry wound measured 7.8 cm by 1.8 cm and was deep enough to cut one of the major branches of the aorta and pierce the upper part of the left lung.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 6 December 1995).



               

The accused's record of interview contained the following admission:Are you able to tell me where you stabbed the man?No I wouldn't have a clue. I know it was on the upper part of the bo [sic], body though.
                     

                  


               

Later in the interview, the accused was asked:Did you, you said that you st, you st, [sic] you stabbed him in the upper part of the body?Yeah.
                        
And you realised that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em?
                        
Not if it's in the arm.
                        
I'm talkin [sic] about the upper body not the arms.
                        
I, yeah I did realise but I, I thought that it was probably around this area sort of, like from the arm to here. So I wasn't, I wasn't sure where I hit him, stabbed him at all.
                     
While describing ""this area sort of, like from the arm to here"", the accused pointed to an area just below the neck running across the chest from arm to arm.

               

In evidence, the accused claimed, as he had during his record of interview, that he killed the deceased in self-defence. He said that he crossed the road in the direction that his father and some friends had gone and that, when he got to the footpath, the deceased pushed him in the chest. The accused said, ""I freaked out. I pulled me knife out. It hit this young man."" He explained that by ""freaked out"" he meant that he ""was scared because [the deceased] was pushing me"" and that he was frightened that he ""was going to get beaten up"". The accused said in evidence that he had no medical training, knew nothing about medicine, and had not heard of the ""subclavium artery"". Under cross-examination, he admitted that he knew that ""in the upper part of the body between the heart and the face there are lots of arteries that carry blood"" and that ""blood vessels are going from the heart to various parts of the body  taking blood around"".

               

The trial judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence that the accused knew ""that what he was doing was likely to cause death"". That being so, the accused contends that he should not have been found guilty of murder because the Crown failed to tender evidence of circumstances from which the conclusion could be drawn that he ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause the death of the deceased. The accused contends that, when the Crown relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) to prove a charge of murder, the prosecution must fail unless the Crown establishes that the accused knew all the relevant facts which are relied on to give rise to the inference that he or she ought to have known that the unlawful act was likely to cause death. The accused argued that a charge under that limb of s 157(1)(c) is not proved if no more is shown than that ordinary persons — even ordinary twenty-one year old persons — know that the unlawful act was one that was likely to cause death.

   establishes that, when the prosecution relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c), the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, and not some hypothetical person, ought to have known, if he or she had thought about it, that there was ""a ""real and not remote"" chance""
                     
    [5]
   that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased 
    [6]
  . That is to say, on the proven facts, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this accused with his or her knowledge ought to have known that there was a real chance that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased. In Boughey 
                     
    [7]
  , Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ, who gave the leading judgment, said that ""the content of the knowledge laid at the door of an accused is [not] to be assessed by reference to the notional knowledge and capacity of some hypothetical person"". Their Honours went on to say that what was relevant for the purpose of the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) was ""the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""

Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

Counsel for the accused contended that the principles laid down in Boughey  led to the conclusion that there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that the accused ought to have known that his act might kill the deceased. He contended that ""without evidence of the particular expertise"" of the accused, the jury could only apply an objective test which ""was impermissible under Boughey 
                     "". But nothing in that case requires the conclusion that a prosecution under the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) must fail unless the Crown proves the state of the accused's knowledge or ""expertise"" by direct evidence.

               

The issue in Boughey  was whether the trial judge had misdirected the jury by referring to the extent that the medical training and experience of the accused should have alerted him ""to the dangers of applying carotid artery pressure"" and ""to the desirability of studying medical literature in order to acquaint himself with the dangers, if any, of such a practice""
                     
    [9]
  . Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said 
    [10]
   that the trial judge's ""remarks about the desirability of studying medical literature would  have been mistaken if they meant that there was to be imputed to the [accused] the knowledge which he would have acquired if he had stopped to study such literature"". However, they held that, read in the context of a long summing up, the ""somewhat ambiguous remark"" of the trial judge had not diverted the jury from examining the accused's actual knowledge as opposed to knowledge that could be imputed to him from the medical literature.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.

                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29.



               

It was in that context that their Honours said that the starting point in the inquiry whether the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause death ""must be the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""
                     
    [11]
   Nothing in that passage or in the decision itself gives any support for the notion that the Crown cannot prove the accused's knowledge inferentially or that the prosecution must fail unless the Crown directly proves the knowledge and expertise of the accused concerning the relevant circumstances.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

The accused's knowledge of or ""expertise"" concerning those circumstances may be proved by his or her own evidence, by out-of-court-admissions or by inference. If the Crown relies on inference to prove that the accused knew the relevant circumstances, the Crown may establish the inference by proving other facts that make it logical to infer that the accused knew the circumstances. If the charge is that the accused ought to have known that defective premises were likely to cause death to those entering them, it may be sufficient to prove that the defect was obvious and that the accused had visited the premises regularly even though the Crown is unable to prove by direct evidence or admission that the accused was aware of the defects in the premises.

               

Moreover, knowledge of the circumstances may often be inferred without proof of additional facts. Some or all of the circumstances may be so well known in a community or to a section of the community of which the accused is a member that it is open to a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew of those circumstances. If a fact or circumstance is so well known that no reasonable person in the section or community would dispute it, a jury may safely infer that the accused knew it unless any denial by him raises a reasonable doubt about his or her knowledge. What facts or circumstances fall into this category will vary from one era to another and from one community to another. The category of such facts and circumstances will be as wide as the common experience of the relevant community of which the accused is a member and will expand as the frontiers of that community's general knowledge expands.

               

No doubt the category is narrower than the list of matters of which a court can take judicial notice. A judge called on to take judicial notice of a fact may have regard to any fact or matter that is within the knowledge of ""every well-informed person in Australia""
                     
    [12]
  . Furthermore, in an appropriate case, the judge may cause ""inquiries to be made by himself for his own information from sources to which it is proper for him to refer""
                     
    [13]
  . When the issue is whether, in the absence of direct evidence, the jury can infer that the accused knew a particular fact or circumstance, however, the relevant community is that to which the accused belongs. The relevant knowledge of that community may be narrower or wider than that of well informed persons in Australia. If the accused is a doctor, for example, and the charge poses a medical issue, the Crown may prove the accused's knowledge by proving a fact or circumstance which no qualified practitioner could reasonably dispute. On the other hand, if the accused is a poorly educated youth in a remote area, the relevant body of knowledge will be that of youths of that class and may be much narrower than that of the general community.

Commonwealth Shipping Representative v Peninsular & Oriental Branch Service [1923] AC 191 at 212, per Lord Sumner.



               

The present case is concerned with the accused's knowledge of the likely result of stabbing a person with a knife. The consequences of using many common objects and substances are widely known in the Australian community. That guns kill, that acid burns, that flame ignites household gas and that driving on the wrong side of a road is likely to cause a collision, for example, are matters so well known in the Australian community that a jury can safely infer that the accused knew about such matters when they are relevant to a charge under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. Ordinary members of that community are also well aware of the consequences that can follow from most uses of knives, fire, gas, electricity and explosives. In cases where the accused has caused the death of a person by using such an object or substance, it will usually be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to infer that the accused knew what could follow from its use.

               

In the present case, the jury could find that the accused intended to stab the deceased somewhere in the upper chest area close to the neck and that he wielded the knife with considerable force. The question which then arises is whether the jury could reasonably find that the accused ought to have known that there was a real chance that his assault might cause the death of the deceased. That depends on whether he knew that forcefully stabbing a person in the upper chest area with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade might lead to the death of that person.

               

The accused was aged twenty-one when the events occurred. Nothing in the evidence indicated that he had less knowledge than other persons of his age concerning the consequences of stabbing a person in the upper chest area. That being so, the jury were entitled to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that there was a real chance that plunging a knife into the upper chest area of a person might lead to death. From an early age, Australian children learn from films, television, comics, books and newspapers that stabbing a person in the stomach, chest, back or neck is likely to kill that person if the knife blade is sharp and long enough and wielded with sufficient force. They may not know why or how the knife blade causes death although no doubt many of them know from an early age that a stabbing will cause bleeding. But they do know that stabbing a person in the neck or body is almost as likely to result in death as shooting a person in those areas. In evidence, the accused did not assert that he knew nothing about the potential consequences of stabbing a person in the upper body. Indeed, he conceded in his record of interview that he ""did realise"" 
                     ""that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em"" (emphasis added). Even if the accused's admission is read as confined to stabbing a person in the neck, it was evidence from which the jury could find that he ought to have known that attempting to stab the deceased in the upper body area might lead to that person's death, if by chance or misadventure the knife went into his neck.

               

Given that it was open to the jury to find that the accused knew that stabbing somebody in the neck might kill that person, it necessarily follows that it was also open to them to find that the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act could cause death. The question for the jury under the ""ought to have known"" limb was not whether the accused intended to kill the deceased or stab him in the neck. Nor was it whether the accused knew that the knife might transect one of the major branches of the aorta. It was whether the accused, if he ""had stopped to think to the extent that he ought to have""
                     
    [14]
  , would have realised that stabbing the deceased with this knife in the general area of the upper body gave rise to a real chance that the stabbing would kill the deceased. The jury could reasonably find that, if the accused had thought about the matter, he would have realised that there was a real chance that, by bringing this knife down in the manner and in the direction that he did, the blade would enter the upper body of the deceased in or near the neck and inflict a fatal wound.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.



               

Moreover, in determining what the accused knew, the jury were entitled to, and no doubt did, act on the basis that an ordinary twenty-one year old person knows that, if he or she forcefully stabs a person in the upper body with a knife that has a 7 cm blade, there is a real chance that it will kill that person. Independently of the accused's admission that he did realise that stabbing somebody ""in that part of the body"" might kill the person, the jury were entitled to think that the chance that the accused did not know what an ordinary twenty-one year old knows was so remote that it could be safely disregarded. Consequently, even if the accused had made no admission, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that he ought to have known that his unlawful act gave rise to a real chance that it might cause the death of the deceased.

               
                  
Misdirection
                  

Alternatively, the accused contended that, even if the admissions made by him in his record of interview were evidence ""as to [his] subjective state of mind"", ""the learned trial judge had a duty to warn the jury in the strongest possible terms that this evidence was not at all cogent in terms of its capacity to establish that state of mind in the subjective sense required by Boughey 
                        "". He also contended that the trial judge had a duty ""to ensure that the jury did not lapse into a review conducted in an objective manner"".

                  

In summing up to the jury on the ""ought to have known"" issue, the trial judge said:In what circumstances should a person have known that his act was likely to cause death. You have to consider this from the position of Mr Simpson, the accused. We're not talking about what some hypothetical person ought to have known or what you would have known, the question is what he ought to have known. So with his actual state of knowledge, his age, which is twenty-one, we don't know much about him really we haven't really been told much about him. But you've heard him in the witness box you might be able to make some assessment of him and you've seen him on that video of course. But with his actual state of knowledge and capacity as you determine the[m] to have been, then you look at the circumstances he was placed in and you determine, you make a judgment and determine ought he to have known that his unlawful act, if there was one, was likely to cause death, even if he didn't want to cause it. You should consider had he stopped to think to the extent that you think he should have, would he have known or appreciated that death was likely to ensue from his act. I'll put it another way, to what extent do you consider that he ought to have stopped to think and if he had done so, would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result. Now that's what ought to have known involves. And let me go to the next bit, ought to have known that it was likely to cause death. The expression ""likely to cause death"" is one you can probably understand but you might have difficulty defining it if you had to. However, it's something, if something is likely to happen or there is a good chance that it will happen it probably means the same thing. It is something that may well happen, you might say it may not happen, but there is a good chance that it will happen. It's likely to happen, these are all similar expressions. So likely to cause death is an ordinary expression which is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real chance as distinct from what is a mere possibility. A good chance that it will happen, something that may well happen, something that is likely to happen, but not just a mere possibility. Now I hope that helps you but look at the words that are used in the memorandum ""likely"" is the word that's used there. So did he know that death was likely to be caused or ought he to have known that death was likely to be caused by his act. That's the question for you. It's a question of fact for the Jury to determine.
                     


                  

The learned judge gave the jury no directions as to how they might determine the accused's state of knowledge; nor did he refer in terms to the admissions of the accused. However, his Honour was under no obligation to give such directions, and counsel for the accused at the trial sought no directions at the conclusion of the summing up. That being so, his Honour's directions cannot be faulted. There is no reason to think that the jury applied an objective test or that the directions permitted ""the onus of proof to shift away from the Crown in respect to proving circumstances peculiar to the [accused] sufficient to allow a jury to find a subjective state of mind in the [accused]"". Nor is there any reason to suppose that the trial miscarried in any way.

                  

His Honour made it clear to the jury that they had to consider the ""ought to have known"" issue ""from the position of  the accused"" and that it was his ""actual state of knowledge"" and not that of ""some hypothetical person"" that was relevant. The learned judge also told the jury that they had to consider that, if the accused had stopped to think about the matter ""would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result"". Given these directions, there is no ground for thinking that the jury would have applied an objective test in determining whether the accused ""ought to have known"" that death was the likely result of his unlawful act.

Kirby and Callinan JJ.
               

Mr Damien John Simpson (the appellant) appeals against the order of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal dismissing his appeal against his conviction for murder. The victim, Mr Tony Smith, died of a single stab wound inflicted in his neck by the appellant.

               
                  
Background facts and admissions to the police
                  

The appellant, a man of twenty-one years at the time of the offence, spent about three hours in the evening of 10 June 1995 at an hotel in Launceston drinking beer and some whiskey. At about half past midnight, he left the hotel in company with five other people, including his father, to walk into the city. On the way, three men accosted one of the appellant's party, Mr Ivan Quarrell, and asked for a cigarette. In a police interview which was recorded on videotape and which commenced some seven or so hours after the events to be described, the appellant gave this account of what occurred:Um, Ivan was talkin to some blokes, three blokes an um, they asked for a cigarette, an Ivan gave em a cigarette and then we walked across the road an Ivan said that um he took me cigarettes, so me father went down across the road an um asked for the cigarettes and they were bein real smart an um  then I ran, then I ran across the road to where me father was an then they started, this bloke started pushin me around and then um first thing I done was grab me knife, cos [he] was pushin me around.
                     


                  

A little later in the interview, the appellant enlarged upon that account:
                           

                              
Q Do you normally carry a knife, do you normally carry this knife all the time?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q And whereabouts did you have the knife?

                              
                              
A In my back pocket.

                              
                              
Q And was it open or was it closed when 
                              

                              
                              
A Yeah, it was closed.

                              
                              
Q Did you open it when you pulled it out of your pocket?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q After this fi , this fellow was pushing you around 
                              

                              
                              
A Mm.

                              
                              
Q 
                                  and you've opened your knife, knife up, what did you do then?

                              
                              
A I leaned, I was tryin ta when he was pushin me, I was, I, all that I done was pulled out me knife an then he pushed me again an then I went like that an then 
                              

                              
                              
Q When did you open it then?

                              
                              
A When it was in me pocket I just went like that an then it flipped open, like as soon as I pulled it out of me, out of me pocket.

                              
                              
Q And how many times did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A Once I think.

                              
                              
Q Whereabouts did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A I wouldn't have a clue.

                              
                              
Q Was he facing you?

                              
                              
A Yeah he was cos [he] was pushing me so, yeah he woulda been facing me.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

In the interview, the appellant was interrogated about his state of mind:
                           

                              
Q Why did you do it?

                              
                              
A Why, cos I was frightened.

                              
                              
Q Frightened of what?

                              
                              
A Because that bloke was pushin me, like cos I thought he was gunna punch me head in (sniff).

                              
                              
Q What was your intention when you pulled your knife out and opened it up?

                              
                              
A No intentions cos I didn't think, I just, I was just tryina get away sorta thing.

                              
                              
Q Well, at the time of pulling the knife out and opening up, did you intend to use the knife?

                              
                              
A Not real, nah. Well as, the split, it happened in a split second that's all I know.

                              
                              
                              
Q At the time that you pulled the knife out though did you intend to kill him?

                              
                              
A No I didn't. I didn't even intend to pull the knife out at all, I didn't, I didn't mean to stab him at all, just (sniff) somin that, it just happened.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

Later, the appellant said that he was scared of his victim who was a ""pretty big bloke"" and was pushing him around. He also expressly denied the investigating police officer's direct assertion that he had intended to stab the deceased. He claimed that he was fairly drunk at the time but admitted, at one point at least, that he knew what he was doing. The Crown called as witnesses, other members of the two groups and an independent witness, a taxi driver who had witnessed the events. There were various differences in their testimony. However, they were remarkably consistent with respect to their observations of how the fatal blow was inflicted by the appellant: that he ran up to the victim, either with his hand raised, or that he raised it when he reached the victim, to strike at him and then, ran away.

                  

The appellant gave evidence at his trial. No other evidence was called in his case. We do not read his evidence as being in substance any different from the account that he gave when he was interviewed by the investigating police officers. Although some of the witnesses' versions were vague, no doubt as a result, in part at least, of the consumption of alcohol, one matter was clear at the trial: that the appellant was not under any direct, serious, personal, physical threat before he struck the victim with his knife.

                  

At trial, the appellant relied on self-defence 
    [15]
  . Clearly this was rejected by the jury. No point now arises about that. Alternatively, the appellant submitted before the jury that, if the Crown had satisfied them that self-defence was negatived, the proper verdict in the circumstances was one of manslaughter. This was so on the ground that the appellant neither knew, nor ought to have known, that death was likely to result from his actions.

Relevantly, s 157 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 
                        Tas (the Criminal Code) provides:
                           

                              
(1) Subject to the provisions of section 160, culpable homicide is murder if it is committed —
                                    
(a) with an intention to cause the death of any person, whether of the person killed or not;

                                    
                                    
(b) with an intention to cause to any person, whether the person killed or not, bodily harm which the offender knew to be likely to cause death in the circumstances, although he had no wish to cause death;

                                    
                                    
(c) by means of any unlawful act or omission which the offender knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances, although he had no wish to cause death or bodily harm to any person.

                                    
                                 

                              


                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

In its reference to what the offender ""ought to have known"", s 157(1)(c) is unique in Australia to Tasmania. Its history is discussed by Brennan J in Boughey v The Queen 
                        
    [16]

Decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal
                  

In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Zeeman J (with whom Cox CJ agreed) summarised the trial judge's directions on the requirements of s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code
                        
    [17]
  :At the trial the Crown did not invite the jury to find that the appellant knew that his unlawful act was likely to cause death in the circumstances. The directions given to the jury by the learned trial judge effectively told the jury to put that matter aside. He invited them to direct their attention to the question of whether the appellant ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause death.

Later 
    [18]
  , Zeeman J quoted the following passage from Boughey 
                        
    [19]
  :[The trial judge's] comments clearly and properly made the point that, whatever may be the difficulties of precise definition, the expression ""likely to cause death"" in s 157(1) is an ordinary expression which is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real chance as distinct from what is a mere possibility: ""a good chance that it will happen""; ""something that may well happen""; something that is ""likely to happen"". In our view, those comments went as far as was desirable in the circumstances of the case. His Honour was correct in not introducing an added requirement either that the applicant directed his mind to, or attempted to calculate, the degree of mathematical probability that his acts would cause death in the circumstances or that the applicant knew or ought to have known that it was ""more likely than not"" or an ""odds on chance"" that his actions would cause death in the circumstances.

                               (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 22, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.



                  

In the Court of Criminal Appeal the appellant argued that he could not, and did not, possess the requisite knowledge that a blow of the kind he inflicted was likely to cause death. In support of this, his counsel referred to a pathologist's evidence that some studies had showed that 10 per cent only of knife wounds to the chest (supposedly the intended target of the appellant's blow) resulted in death. With respect to this argument and in dismissing it, Zeeman J pointed to these circumstances 
    [20]
  :
                           

                              
1. There was evidence which justified the conclusion that the appellant ran up to the deceased, raised the knife which he held in his hand and stabbed the deceased in the neck in a downward motion.

                              
                              
2. There was evidence from the pathologist that the wound inflicted was to the left side of the neck, measured 7.8 cm x 1.8 cm and had resulted in a complete transection of one of the major branches of the aorta, a cutting of the muscle and a piercing of the upper part of the left lung.

                              
                              
3. The appellant gave evidence that he directed the blow with the knife to the upper part of the body of the deceased and that he knew that the upper part of the body contained arteries.

                              
                           

                        

                     



Simpson v The Queen (unreported; 13 November 1996), at 4.



                  

All of the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Slicer J, although he had some reservations about some aspects of the way in which the case on manslaughter had been put by both the prosecutor and the defence at the trial, found no error in the trial judge's summing up to the jury. He was satisfied that no miscarriage of justice had occurred. The other judges concluded that no error had been shown. The Court dismissed the appeal. By special leave, the appellant has now appealed to this Court.

               
               
                  
Grounds of appeal
                  

The grounds of appeal which were pursued during the hearing before this Court, as amended, alleged that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in failing to hold that the trial judge: (1) had failed to direct the jury in accordance with the judgment of this Court in Boughey  as to the jury's task in determining if the appellant ought to have known his act [of stabbing the deceased] was likely to cause death in the circumstances; and (2) should have withdrawn the charge of murder from the jury pursuant to s 157(1)(c), in that there was insufficient evidence that the appellant knew or ought to have known that his act [of stabbing the deceased] was likely to cause death.

                  

The two grounds of appeal are related. They may be dealt with together.

               
               
                  
Complaints about the summing up
                  

The relevant passage in the trial judge's summing up, complained of by the appellant, was as follows:In what circumstances should a person have known that his act was likely to cause death. You have to consider this from the position of Mr Simpson, the accused. We're not talking about what some hypothetical person ought to have known or what you would have known, the question is what he ought to have known. So with his actual state of knowledge, his age, which is twenty-one, we don't know much about him really we haven't really been told much about him. But you've heard him in the witness box you might be able to make some assessment of him and you've seen him on that video of course. But with his actual state of knowledge and capacity as you determine them to have been, then you look at the circumstances he was placed in and you determine, you make a judgment and determine ought he to have known that his unlawful act, if there was one, was likely to cause death, even if he didn't want to cause it. You should consider had he stopped to think to the extent that you think he should have, would he have known or appreciated that death was likely to ensue from his act. I'll put it another way, to what extent do you consider that he ought to have stopped to think, and if he had done so, would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result. Now that's what ought to have known involves. And let me go to the next bit, ought to have known that it was likely to cause death. The expression ""likely to cause death"" is one you can probably understand but you might have difficulty defining it if you had to. However, it's something, if something is likely to happen or there is a good chance that it will happen it probably means the same thing. It is something that may well happen, you might say it may not happen, but there is a good chance it will happen. It's likely to happen, these are all similar expressions. So likely to cause death is an ordinary expression which is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real chance that it will happen, something that may well happen, something that is likely to happen, but not just a mere possibility. Now I hope that helps you but look at the words that are used in the memorandum ""likely"" is the word that's used there. So did he know that death was likely to be caused or ought he to have known that death was likely to be caused by his act. That's the question for you. It's a question of fact for the jury to determine.
                     


                  

The appellant contends that the directions given by his Honour fell short of what was required by Boughey.  The argument was that the test was a subjective one and must be posed in relation to a particular person, the appellant. In support of these submissions the appellant relied on R v Phillips 
                        
    [21]
   and Boughey 
                        
    [22]
  .

                               (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 20, 28, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.



                  


                        
Boughey  was something of a special case. The appellant there was a medical practitioner actually possessed of a special knowledge that the activities in which he and the victim were engaged and which led to the latter's death were such as were likely to cause death in the sense in which ""likely"" was used in s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. In this case it was not suggested that there was any special knowledge on the part of the appellant.

                  

The appellant's submissions went so far as to contend that the prosecution, in order to satisfy s 157(1)(c), must prove by evidence, the actual state of knowledge and awareness of a particular accused. Such a submission would effectively deny the right of the jury to draw inferences as to matters of ordinary common sense and common awareness. Because the appellant was a twenty-one year old man, showing no apparent disability or want of ordinary experience, it was plainly open to the jury to infer that the appellant ought to have known that the striking of a blow with a knife in the vicinity of a person's chest or neck was likely to cause that person's death. Implicit in the appellant's submission was the proposition that, in any case in which detailed evidence of the actual knowledge of an accused as to a fairly precise relationship between an act and its physiological consequences was absent, the case should be taken from the jury. Such a construction of the provision is untenable. It is rejected.

                  

In establishing the ""knowledge"" and ""awareness"" of an accused person, it is usually necessary (in the absence of clear admission) to rely on inference. This is normally the way in which such matters are established in a criminal trial. It can hardly be otherwise. Furthermore, knowledge and awareness do not necessarily involve any element of intention 
    [23]
  .


Contrast Cutter v The Queen (1997) 71 ALJR 638; 
                               143 ALR 498, in which the statutory provision (s 283 of the Criminal Code 
                              WA), required as an element of the offence, an intention on the part of the offender to cause death.



                  

In Doney v The Queen 
                        
    [24]
  , this Court discussed the role of a jury in drawing inferences in terms which bear repeating in the present context:The acceptance or rejection of evidence involves an inference as to its truth, which inference is, at least in part, based on ""a principle of faith in human veracity sanctioned by experience""
                           
    [25]
  . It is usual not to so categorise the inferences involved in the acceptance of direct or testimonial evidence and to treat the process of inference as confined to circumstantial evidence. But it is appropriate here to draw attention to the fact that the drawing of inferences extends beyond circumstantial evidence because the purpose and the genius of the jury system is that it allows for the ordinary experiences of ordinary people to be brought to bear in the determination of factual matters. It is fundamental to that purpose that the jury be allowed to determine, by inference from its collective experience of ordinary affairs, whether and, in the case of conflict, what evidence is truthful.
                     




                               (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214, per Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.

                                 Wigmore, Evidence (1983), vol 1A, p 954, referring to an unverified citation from Starkie's Evidence (1824).



               
               
                  
Conclusion: no error or miscarriage
                  

Measured against the Criminal Code, the trial judge's summing up was adequate in the circumstances. Clearly, it was open to the jury to conclude that a twenty-one year old person of ordinary understanding, such as the appellant, ought to have appreciated that his act of stabbing was likely to cause death. This is not a matter of deciding what the appellant objectively ought to have known as a hypothetical ordinary person. It is instead, a matter of inferring what, subjectively, this particular accused ought to have known as derived from the facts objectively known about him, supplemented by common knowledge and experience. The jury in this case were not misled by the trial judge's directions. Those directions, and the conduct of the trial on the issue, were accurate and entirely fair to the appellant.

                  

As to the second ground of appeal, alleging that the trial judge should have withdrawn from the jury the prosecution's contention that the appellant ought to have known that his act of stabbing the deceased was likely to cause death, it is sufficient to repeat that any person of the appellant's age and background having ordinary understanding, such as the appellant, ought to have appreciated that what he did was likely to cause death. As Boughey  makes plain, the questions are: (1) whether the appellant, ""with the knowledge and the capacity which he or she actually possessed, ought to have thought about the likely consequences of his or her action""
                        
    [26]
  ; and (2) if the appellant ""had stopped to think to the extent that he ought to have, the result would, as a matter of fact, have been that he would have known or appreciated that the relevant act or acts were likely to cause death""
                        
    [27]
  , ""likely"", being used in its ordinary meaning, namely, to convey the notion of a substantial — a ""real and not remote"" — chance whether it is less or more than 50 per cent

There was, moreover, the appellant's own admission in the course of his interview by police during which the following questions were asked and answers given:
                           

                              
Q Did you, you said that you st, you st, you stabbed him in the upper part of the body?

                              
                              
A Yeah.

                              
                              
Q And you realised that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill 'em?

                              
                              
A Not if it's in the arm.

                              
                              
Q I'm talkin about the upper body not the arms.

                              
                              
A 
                                 I, yeah, I did realise but I, I thought that it was probably around this area sort of, like from the arm to here  (Emphasis added.)

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

The video tape of the interview which was seen by the jury and viewed by this Court shows plainly that the area indicated by the appellant in giving the answer last quoted included the area of the upper body in which the fatal blow was struck. Even children in Australia know that the upper chest and neck areas of the human body are vulnerable. When stabbed, bleeding will ordinarily occur. When stabbed with force with a knife, there is a real chance that the victim will die as a consequence. It was therefore open to the jury, particularly with the admission made by the appellant, to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had established that the appellant ought to have known that his action was likely to cause the death of the deceased. Under the Criminal Code, that was sufficient to sustain the appellant's conviction of murder.

                  

It is arguable, on the appellant's admissions, that a case could have been left to the jury on the first limb of s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, that is, that the appellant knew that his conduct was likely to cause death. However that may be, it was certainly open to the jury to conclude that the conduct proved fell within the second limb of the paragraph. No error occurred in the direction of the trial judge, nor in his failure to withdraw the count from the jury. No miscarriage of justice is shown in the appellant's conviction.

               
               
                  
Order

Hayne J.
               

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. I do not repeat them. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed and do so generally for the reasons given by Kirby and Callinan JJ.

               

It was open to the jury at the appellant's trial to conclude that the appellant had admitted in his record of interview that he realised that to stab someone in the upper part of the body near the neck was likely to cause death. Even if this admission were disregarded, it was open to the jury to conclude that the accused ought to have known that to stab someone near the neck was likely to cause death.

               

It matters not that he may not have understood the mechanics of the process that led to such a wound being fatal. What matters is that it was well open to the jury to conclude that this accused, an apparently ordinary twenty-one year old, ought to have known that there was a real chance that stabbing a person as he did might cause death. That is, it was open to the jury to conclude that he ought to have thought about the likely consequences of his action and that if he had stopped to think he would have known or appreciated that there was a real and not remote chance of causing death.

               

I also agree that there was no misdirection about this issue. The trial judge told the jury that they must ""consider [the matter] from the position of Mr Simpson, the accused"" and emphasised that the inquiry was about his subjective state of mind. There was no occasion, in this case, to direct the jury to consider the accused's knowledge of the mechanics of the process that followed from the stabbing and caused the death.",1998-07-23 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

4Matters (1), (3) and (4) on the Form 1 carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  Matter (2) on the Form 1 carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.  Matter (5) carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.
5The applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment for 6 years to commence 4 December 2008 and to expire 3 December 2014 with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 3 December 2012.
Count 2 (and Form 1 matters) - Imprisonment for 8 years and 6 months to commence on 4 December 2009 and to expire 3 June 2018 with a non-parole period of 6 years to expire 3 December 2015.
6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
Ground 2 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed on the co-offender referred to as OS1.
Factual Background
7The applicant was born in 1952 and is the father of Bassam Hamzy and Ghassan Amoun and the uncle of Mohammed Hamze.
8Between 21 April 2007 and 7 July 2008 Bassam Hamzy was a sentenced prisoner at Lithgow Gaol.  He was in possession of an unauthorised mobile telephone.
9Between 1 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 that telephone service was lawfully intercepted.  During this time, a high level of organised criminal activity was identified.  The mobile phone was used on average 460 times a day and the majority of the calls recorded were associated with the activities of the criminal group.  
10The calls revealed that Bassam Hamzy was the principal of a criminal group which operated a drug supply network between Sydney and Melbourne between May and June 2008.
11The criminal group comprised family members of Bassam Hamzy, including the applicant and associates.  Bassam Hamzy led and directed the activities of the group by sourcing and distributing prohibited drugs and managing the profits from the sales and otherwise managing the group including seeking out new members.
12In total the syndicate was involved in nine discrete instances of supplying a prohibited drug.  The applicant was involved in three of those supplies.
Count 1 - Supply of commercial quantity methylamphetamine (372 grams)
13On Monday 5 May 2008 Bassam Hamzy was contacted by Mohammed Hamze, who was a relative.  Those conversations discussed transporting drugs from Melbourne and finding a courier to transport drugs to Melbourne.  Subsequently, OS1, who owned a small transport company, was recruited as the courier for the syndicate using his legitimate company to conceal the illegal operations of the syndicate.
14On 17 and 18 May Bassam Hamzy, OS1, Mohammed Hamze and Ghassan Amoun agreed to supply Imran Allouche with 372 grams of methylamphetamine.
15The methylamphetamine to be supplied to Allouche was obtained by the applicant.  The applicant in turn provided the drugs to Amoun who delivered them to OS1.  OS1 took this package to Melbourne and with Mohammed Hamze arranged to supply the methylamphetamine to Imran Allouche.
16Telephone discussions took place in the course of which money owed to the syndicate by a Con Bodiotis was discussed.  OS1 confirmed that he had $21,000 that was part payment from Bodiotis for drugs previously supplied.  Arrangements were made for OS1 to go to the home of the applicant and give him the $21,000.  This occurred.  (The collection of the $21,000 from Bodiotis is the foundation of the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being charge number 1 on the Form 1.)
17On 17 May discussions took place as to the purity of the drug being supplied.  One of those conversations involved Bassam Hamzy and the applicant.  The applicant who had called the supplier said that the drugs were of better purity than those supplied to them previously.
18Subsequently, a new price for the drugs was negotiated because of the purity.  OS1 confirmed that he took the drugs directly from Amoun and then passed them onto Allouche.  On 20 May 2008 OS1 contacted Bassam Hamzy and during this conversation they spoke of Allouche owing the syndicate $85,000.
Count 2 - Supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 8 - 14 June 2008 (995 grams)
19On 8 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and the applicant agreed that the applicant would obtain a significant quantity of methylamphetamine from an unknown supplier.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that the price for the drug was $185,000.  The drug had a high level of purity.  By 9 June 2008 the applicant had successfully obtained 995 grams of methylamphetamine from the supplier.
20In due course OS1 attended upon the applicant and collected the methylamphetamine.  Those drugs were taken to Melbourne for on-supply.  In discussions between OS1 and Bassam Hamzy, the drugs were described as of high quality.  OS1 was given directions to supply 164 grams to Con Bodiotis and the remaining quantity to other persons who were named.  Payment of $110,000 for 500 grams of methylamphetamine was eventually negotiated.
21On the evening of 10 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and OS1 spoke about the proceeds of the supply (and intended supply) of the methylamphetamine.  Bassam Hamzy told OS1 to tell the applicant that he missed his flight and would return to Sydney with the money the following day.  Later that night, OS1 told Bassam Hamzy that he had so far collected $33,500 from Bodiotis.  Subsequently, most of the methylamphetamine was supplied to Bodiotis.  By the evening of 12 June 2008 OS1 advised that he had collected $65,000 from Con Bodiotis and that Bodiotis owed a further $125,000.
22On 13 June the applicant complained to Bassam Hamzy about how long it was taking for the money to be collected and that his supplier would not trust him any more.  The applicant told Mohammed Hamze that he had to get $185,000 to pay his supplier for the methylamphetamine before anything else.
23At 10.20pm on 13 June 2008, the applicant travelled from Sydney to Melbourne and received $117,000 collected by OS1 and Mohammed Hamze (the collection of the $117,000 is the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being Charge (4) on the Form 1).
24The applicant then returned to Sydney from Melbourne driving the same car OS1 had used to transport the kilogram of methylamphetamine on 9 June 2008.
25In a conversation on the afternoon of 14 June 2008, OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant was ""dirty"" because he thought there was money missing.  OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant thought there should be $240,000 but only collected $117,000 from OS1.  At 7pm on 14 June 2008 Con Bodiotis told Mohammed Hamze that he was still owed $56,000 and was arranging that amount of money for tomorrow.  Mohammed Hamze said his uncle (the applicant) was ""fuming"".  OS1 flew to Sydney from Melbourne, arriving in Sydney at 10.35pm.
26On 23 August 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was lawfully recorded.  During this conversation both the applicant and his son discussed various amounts of money owed to them, including from Mohammed Hamze.  Bassam Hamzy was recorded as saying that Mohammed had ripped them off for $90,000.
Additional Form 1 facts
Charge 2 and 3 on the Form 1:  Supply prohibited drug (182 grams of  methylamphetamine) and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime ($31,400)
27Between 5 and 6 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy agreed to supply a quantity of methylamphetamine to Con Bodiotis.  The applicant obtained 182 grams of methylamphetamine which was delivered to Khaled Taleb who took the drug to Melbourne and delivered it to Con Bodiotis.
28On 6 June 2008 a conversation took place between Bassam Hamzy and Con Bodiotis.  A price for the methylamphetamine to be supplied was negotiated.  Due to the poor quality of the drug, Bodiotis would only have to pay $33,500 for 6 ounces.
29At 6pm on 7 June 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was intercepted.  In this conversation Bassam Hamzy and the applicant discussed how much they should collect for the drug.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that he paid $5,180 per ounce for the drug.  In subsequent conversations, Bassam Hamzy discussed the collection of money from Con Bodiotis, being payment for the supply of 182 grams of methylamphetamine.  Eventually, Con Bodiotis arranged for $31,400 in total to be delivered to the applicant and this took place.
Charge No 5 on the Form 1
Participating in a criminal group from 1 May 2008 to 5 July 2008
30In May 2008 OS1 was the sole director of Parcdel Pty Ltd.  That company operated three refrigerated trucks in the Sydney area.  OS1 advised Bassam Hamzy that the business was heavily in debt and that he was close to having his fleet of trucks repossessed.  Bassam Hamzy and OS1 came to an arrangement whereby Bassam Hamzy was to support the business with his own money and from the proceeds of subsequent supplies of prohibited drugs.  In return for the injection of money, OS1 agreed that the company would act as a front for other activities involving Bassam Hamzy's family and associates.  A number of Bassam Hamzy's family members, including the applicant, were to be directors of the company.
31BPay accounts were set up to allow the depositing of monies directly into the company accounts.  Parcdel's trucks were to be used for the supply of drugs to interstate purchasers under the guise of carrying on a legitimate freight business.
Proceedings in the District Court and the findings of the sentencing judge
32In reviewing the facts, his Honour found that the drug supply network operated by Bassam Hamzy depended for its success upon persons such as the applicant who were willing to become involved in facilitating negotiations and other arrangements for the supply of the prohibited drugs.
33In relation to assistance provided to the authorities, his Honour noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant approached the authorities and provided a line of communication between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy with a view to the Crime Commission furthering legitimate investigative operational objectives.  The importance of that communication was that Bassam Hamzy had told the Crime Commission officers that he was able to return certain items which the Crime Commission was looking for.  His Honour found that there was a real issue as to whether Bassam Hamzy ever had the knowledge and capacity to retrieve the particular items.  His Honour accepted that the applicant genuinely thought that his son did have such a capacity.
34It was the applicant's submission that the only way these items could be obtained was if sufficient money was available to purchase them.  Since the Crime Commission was not prepared to pay that money, it was necessary for him and his son to deal in drugs in order to obtain money to pay for these items.  The applicant believed that the acquisition of these items would improve his position and that of Bassam Hamzy with the Crime Commission.  The Crown disputed that this was the applicant's motivation.  The Crown submitted that profit was the prime motivation.
35His Honour found (ROS 35.5) as follows:
""The matter must proceed on the basis that the offender was involved in the supply of drugs for a limited period between 17 May and 24 June, a period a little over one month.  However the material before me, including the conduct of the offender beyond this period and inferences that can be drawn from what the offender said in the intercepted calls, provide colour and context to the true role of the offender in the particular supplies for which he is to be sentenced.   It would be artificial to look only at the conduct of the offender in the steps towards effecting the particular supplies when there is a body of other evidence to place his conduct in some context and which would assist in understanding his role in the overall enterprise compared to other participants and in particular in understanding his position in relation to Bassam Hamzy and OS1.""
His Honour decided that it would be best to proceed on the basis of what the applicant actually did (ROS 35.9).
36His Honour described the participation of the applicant as follows (ROS 36.1):
""In relation to the three occasions the offender played a role in the supply of prohibited drug, the offender was involved in the procurement of the drug for on supply. The evidence suggests that he sourced the drug from one particular supplier.
The offender was engaged in the processes towards the delivery of the drug and it's transportation to Melbourne. The offender also played a significant role in the recouping of monies that were collected by others in Melbourne.
The offender was at all times acting on the direction of his son though he was able to bring some enterprise into the procuring of the drug.  Contributions he made in discussions with Bassam Hamzy about procurement of the drug would suggest that he was able to bring some knowledge of the illicit drug trade into the negotiating process. As can be seen in the extracts of the intercepted calls I have referred to the offender speaks with Bassam Hamzy about aspects of the negotiation for the procurement of the drug including references to the quality and quantity of the drug procured from the supplier.
The offender at times organised others in effecting steps in the supply of the drug in Melbourne. On one occasion he provided a vehicle to OS1 to transport a quantity of drug. He also adopted a role in overseeing the collection of monies and acted as the repository of the monies realised in the supplies in which he was involved.  The offender provided a crucial role in putting into effect the supplies promoted by his son who was otherwise constrained by his incarceration.  In that regard the offender provided an effective conduit for Bassam Hamzy.
The involvement of the accused at the level of procurement, the nature of the discussions with his son at the time of procurement, the involvement of the offender in the collection of monies, his overseeing role at times and the provision of assistance to those effecting the transactions support the conclusion that, in those supplies that he was involved in, he was at the nucleus of the organisation of the supply. He provided essential support and assistance to his son Bassam Hamzy and was involved in a number of steps in the planning of the supplies.
I am of the view, having considered the content of the intercepted calls that the offender would have been aware of the scale of the operation that Bassam Hamzy was controlling from custody. With regard to the matter on the form one relating to the offender's participation in a criminal group, I am of the view that the offender intended a continuing role in the criminal enterprise controlled by Bassam Hamzy. The conduct of the offender in assisting Bassam Hamzy referred to in the statement of facts extends past the period in which the offender was involved in the supply offences for which he faces sentence.""
37At ROS 38.8 his Honour said:
""It is conceded by counsel for the offender that the offender's role was pivotal in the supply of substantial quantities of prohibited drug in the three supply transactions in which he was involved.  ...
I am not of the view that the offender's role was the equivalent of Bassam Hamzy in the drug supplies in which he was involved. I am of the view also that the role of OS1 was ultimately greater than the role of the offender. I will further refer to the role of OS1 when considering the issue of parity of sentence.""
38In relation to the quantity of drugs involved, his Honour said:
""Quantity is not the sole determinative factor. The offender was however trafficking in prohibited drugs to a substantial degree. In relation to count one, the quantity involved, 372 grams, is towards the bottom half of the range of quantities within the commercial quantity for methylamphetamine.  The amount of 995g is at the top of the range of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine.  The quantity of drug the subject of the third supply on the form one, 182 grams, is less than the commercial quantity.""
His Honour found that the applicant ""knew that the purpose of the supplies was to realise a substantial profit"".  (ROS 39.4)
39In relation to motivation, his Honour found:
""Whilst there was a benefit to the community in the retrieval of the [items], I cannot be satisfied that this was a motivation for his offending.  I am of the view that the offender's motives were not altruistic.  He was keen for a significant benefit to flow to his son from the retrieval of them [items] and he was prepared to engage in substantial criminal conduct to achieve that purpose. In his attempts to achieve that purpose he was prepared to be involved in the dissemination of large quantities of prohibited drug, which would have had as a consequence substantial harm to the community.  The content and nature of the intercepted conversations in which the offender was involved, which I have referred to at length, and his conduct in effecting the supplies do not suggest any impaired or flawed thinking.
The offending is objectively serious and calls for a strong element of deterrence.""
40His Honour reviewed the applicant's personal factors.  He was born in Lebanon.  He had a happy childhood, except for the Lebanese civil war which affected his village.  He migrated to Australia in 1973 at the age of 20 but returned to Lebanon at the end of 1974.  He married in Lebanon in 1975.  Due to further civil unrest in Lebanon in 1975, he returned to Australia with his wife.  Together the applicant and his wife had five children.  On return to Australia, the applicant maintained regular employment until he injured his back and neck in a car accident in 1982.  He ceased work and received a substantial compensation payout in 1986.
41In 1988 the applicant gained part-time employment as a leather cutter and in 1989, he and a friend created a company to export powdered milk to Lebanon.  This company was used to facilitate the importation of heroin.  The company was wound up when the applicant was arrested in 1991.  The applicant received a lengthy sentence for the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin and was not released to parole until 2005.  Upon his release, he worked part-time until May 2008.  The applicant was receiving unemployment benefits at the time of his arrest for these offences.
42The applicant's marriage was dissolved in 1996.  He said that he maintained a close relationship with all of his children.  
43As already indicated, the most significant matter insofar as the applicant's criminal record was concerned is his conviction of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin, for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.  The applicant was on parole for that matter when he committed the offences, the subject of this appeal.  
44His Honour accepted that his plea of guilty indicated a degree of remorse.  In relation to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, his Honour said:
""I am satisfied that the plea of guilty was entered on 22 November, 2011.  The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court following committal proceedings where the issue was the quantity of drug involved.  The crown subsequently accepted a plea to a lesser count of supply the commercial quantity of prohibited drug.  The offender was committed for sentence from the local court.  The pleas could be said to have been entered at an early opportunity.
The offender is entitled, having regard to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, to a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. 
I will return to set out the discount for the offender's plea together with the discount on sentence for the offender's assistance to the authorities.""  (ROS 45.8)
45His Honour found it difficult to assess the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and was unable to make any meaningful prediction.  His Honour noted that the applicant was involved again in criminal conduct of a most serious kind and faced a further lengthy period of imprisonment.  His Honour also noted that the applicant had spent a considerable period of his adult life in custody, i.e. 16 of the last 19 ½ years.
46Nevertheless, given his age on release, his Honour considered that the applicant would require some continuing assistance through supervision.  His Honour thought that the parole period which he intended to impose would allow sufficient opportunity for supervision and accordingly, he declined to find special circumstances.
47His Honour took into account parity, with particular reference to OS1.  His Honour said:
""Ensuring parity in sentencing with the sentences imposed upon the offender OS1 is not without difficulty.  There are limitations in comparing the sentences imposed.  Prosecutorial decisions as to the groupings of particular amounts of drug make it difficult to determine the sentence imposed on those amounts supplied which are common to both the offender and OS1.  Counts involving the large commercial quantity were proffered which grouped what are supplies within a course of conduct.
The counts to which the offender OS1 pleaded guilty involved the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with other unrelated criminal activity.
OS1 was sentenced for his involvement in additional supply offences identified in the intercepted calls for which the offender does not face sentence here.
On the material before me the offender OS1, over time, became significantly involved in the overall management of the movement of the drugs and in significant aspects of the negotiation of the supplies.  The offender OS1 was substantially involved in the collection of monies the subject of the sales on behalf of the syndicate.  The offender OS1 played a critical role in the preparation and transport of substantial quantities of drug.  These findings are consistent with the findings of the sentencing judge. OS1 ultimately became a significant member in the syndicate operated by Bassam Hamzy.
OS1 was involved in a number of supply transactions over a greater period. The offences for which he was sentenced involved greater quantities of drugs. 
OS1 was also sentenced on an objectively serious offence of aggravated break enter and steal. He received a separate sentence for that offence of two years with a non-parole of 18 months.
I am of the view that in all of the circumstances here issues concerning parity of sentence with OS1, whilst relevant, have only limited application.""  (ROS 50.1)
48His Honour then reviewed the applicant's assistance to authorities.  His Honour noted that the applicant had provided information to authorities which had led to an Islamic cleric being banned from entering gaol because this cleric was responsible for radical Islamic teachings amongst prisoners.
49He provided information about some murder suspects, but these suspects were already known to the police.  He did not make a statement.  The information provided was not particularly valuable.  He acted as conduit between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy, but ultimately that communication led to nothing and no reliable information was provided.  In relation to that contact, his Honour said:
""In relation to the offender's assistance generally, it would appear at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his son's within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""
50The only real assistance provided by the applicant to authorities was that he arranged for one of his sons to deliver 9 firearms and a quantity of ammunition and explosives to the police.  In relation to that, his Honour said:
""The letter of assistance notes that the nature and extent of assistance was limited. No information was given as to the source of the items.""
51Nevertheless, the surrender of the firearms and explosives was of some benefit to the community in that they were capable of causing substantial harm and had the potential to be used in unlawful activities.
52His Honour's conclusions in relation to s23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be set out:
""I have taken into account the matters to be considered in s 23(2).   The significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance has not been assessed as high. 
The offender has placed himself at some personal risk however, unless the nature of his assistance is disseminated, he is not, on the material before me, likely to suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance.
Section 23(3) provides that any lesser penalty that is imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
It is relevant, as the Crown has submitted, that the offender has already received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
In SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19, Buddin J considered at length the authorities concerning the appropriate range of the composite discount for assistance and the plea of guilty and concluded that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case.
I am of the view that in the circumstances of the present case that a combined discount for assistance and the guilty plea should be in the order of 30%.""  (ROS 53.6)
53By way of additional information, it should be noted that OS1 successfully appealed to this Court against the sentence imposed on him (OS1 v R [2012] NSWCCA 102 (Allsop P; Davies and Schmidt JJ).  OS1 pleaded guilty to four offences as follows:
Count 1 - Aggravated (in company) break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely the larceny of a quantity of frozen food (maximum penalty - 20 years  with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
Count 2 - Supply a prohibited drug, being more than the indictable quantity, namely 140.7g cocaine (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment). Count 3 - Supply large quantity prohibited drug, namely MDMA 600g (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
Count 4 - Supply large commercial quantity prohibited drug, namely 2.154 kg methylamphetamine (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
54The following offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of Count 4:
(a)Knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime (four offences);
(b)Supply prohibited drug being more than the indictable quantity, namely 6.68 kg cannabis;
(c)Participating in a criminal group;
(d)Knowingly take part in the supply of prohibited drug more than the indictable quantity, namely 56g cocaine;
(e)Possess prohibited drug, namely 2.6g cocaine
(f)Drive while under the influence of drugs (cocaine).
55OS1 was sentenced by Judge King SC on 29 October 2010 as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year six months commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring on 29 May 2010. Count 2 - Fixed   term   of  imprisonment  of  eighteen   months commencing on 30 May 2009.
Count 3 - Imprisonment for six years consisting of a non parole period of four years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring on 29 November 2013.
Count 4 - Taking into account the matters on a Form One, imprisonment for eight years consisting of a non-parole period of five years commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring on 29 November 2015.
The effective sentence was a period of imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of seven years commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring 29 November 2015.
56That sentence had incorporated in it a combined discount of 50 percent for both the plea of guilty and assistance.  That discount was further broken down so that 25 percent was apportioned to the plea of guilty, 5 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.  This Court had before it in the appeal a confidential document.  That document made it clear that OS1 had already provided considerable assistance in relation to the past and had undertaken to give evidence against a large number of persons in the future.  It was accepted by Judge King SC that OS1 had a justified fear for himself and his family.  The Court considered that the level of assistance provided by OS1 was exceptional and that a combined discount of 60 percent should have been applied, which would be apportioned as to 25 percent for the early plea, 15 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.
57Following that adjustment, the sentences for Counts 3 and 4 were quashed and replaced with the following:
""(a) In respect of the offence charged in Count Three a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring 29 November 2012 with an additional term of 1 year;
(b) In respect of the offence charged in Count Four and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring 29 May 2014 with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months.""
58Allowing for the effect of the 60 percent discount, the undiscounted total sentence for Count 4 was one of 15 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months.  By way of contrast, the undiscounted sentence for the applicant in respect of Count 2, was a head sentence of 12 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.  The total undiscounted sentence imposed on the applicant for both counts was 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years.
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
59Despite the terms in which this ground has been expressed, the effect of oral submissions was that the extent of the discount for assistance was inadequate and that a discount which was substantially greater should have been allowed.
60In relation to the specific terms of Ground 1, his Honour noted at ROS 52.8 that:
"" ... at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his sons within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""
61In the course of applying s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and assessing the level of the applicant's assistance, his Honour said at ROS 53.9:
""It is relevant, as the Crown has submitted, that the offender has already received some benefit from his offer of assistance.""
62It is clear from the overall context of the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour took into account the receipt of ""some benefit from his offer of assistance""  to a very small extent, if at all.  In any event, it is clear from the material before his Honour that the applicant did receive some benefit from his assistance.
63The applicant gave evidence that he had not seen his son, Bassam Hamzy, since 2001 and that upon his release to parole in March 2005, he was extremely upset to learn that on public interest grounds he was not allowed to visit his son.  He took steps to change that situation and was advised by the Ombudsman that he could visit his son at the Lithgow Correctional Centre.  Subsequently, by offering himself as a conduit between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy his visitation rights with his son were significantly enhanced, even though Bassam Hamzy was at that time an inmate of the ""Super Max"" detention centre at Goulburn.  To that extent, as his Honour appreciated, the applicant had received a benefit from his offer of assistance.
64The oral submissions in the appeal were predicated upon the proposition that in allowing a composite discount for an early plea of guilty and for assistance, his Honour must have allowed 25 percent as the discount for the early plea of guilty.  That assumption is not made out.
65It is clear from his Honour's description of the circumstances surrounding the entry of the plea of guilty, that there was some element of negotiation involved (see [44] hereof).  It is also significant that his Honour's finding in relation to a discount for the plea of guilty, was somewhat qualified.  
""The pleas could be said to have been entered at an early opportunity."" (ROS 45.9)
His Honour did not find that the plea were entered at the earliest opportunity.  
66In such circumstances a sentencing judge has a broad discretion as to the amount of the discount to be awarded.  In Regina v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 Hodgson JA (with whom Dowd and Barr JJ agreed) said:
""4  However, the utilitarian discount is a recognition of advantages to the administration of justice that actually flow from a plea of guilty. By reason of statutory provisions applying in New South Wales, in this State it is not given merely on the basis that the offender's culpability is mitigated by demonstration of willingness to facilitate the course of justice: R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300, distinguishing Cameron v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382.
5  If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been made at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount."" 
67In Regina v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 Howie J said:
""11  Frankly I do not understand how on the established principles it could be determined that the pleas of guilty for the offences for which the respondent was sentenced were early pleas and that they justified a discount of 25 per cent. There is no utility in a plea of guilty that has not been forthcoming. If the accused is not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown takes some course, then so be it. But if by withholding the plea the offender achieved the result he wanted, I do not understand why he should receive further favourable treatment on the basis that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value when it did not.  Rarely, if ever, will the reason why the accused has withheld the plea of guilty be a relevant matter in determining the utilitarian discount. Where it has been used as a bargaining tool in order to achieve a favourable outcome from the Crown in respect of some other charge, I do not understand that this circumstance can excuse the delay or provides a basis for asserting that the plea was made at the first reasonable opportunity.
...
13  In the present case there was no attention paid by the Judge to the real utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty or to the established authority of R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 and numerous other cases holding that there is no entitlement to any particular discount even if the plea of guilty is at the first reasonable opportunity. ...""
68In Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296 Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed) said:
""13  The applicant Sullivan relies upon two grounds of appeal. The first is that her Honour gave insufficient weight to the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. The Judge gave him a discount of 15 percent. She acknowledged that the pleas involved ""significant utilitarian value"" but noted that the ""late negotiation and entry of pleas meant that the Crown had to prepare for the trial or series of separate trials, therefore the utilitarian value of the pleas was diminished by their being made at that late stage"".
14  In effect the submission is that, having regard to the complexities of the matters and the delay by the Crown in determining the precise charges to bring against the applicants in the District Court, the discount should have been ""at least 20 per cent"". The short answer is that this Court would not generally find that there was an error in the exercise of discretion in choosing a discount of 15 per cent rather than one of 20 per cent, in particular where the Judge gives reasons for determining the discount chosen.""
69In R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said:
""31  As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range.
32  It should not be necessary to do so, but, because there appears to be discrepancies in the application of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, it is apposite to set out in point form the principles laid down by this Court and to be applied by sentencing courts. Of course these are principles of general application and are subject to the scheme set out in Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 and regulations made under that Act: 
1.  The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116].
...
8.  Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Giac [2008] NSWCCA 280. 
9.  The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain: Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Ahmad [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan and Skillin [2009] NSWCCA 296; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Saad [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1: Chiekh and Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448.
...""
70Being mindful of that qualification, it is necessary to turn to the extent of the assistance.  This was carefully analysed by his Honour (see [48] - [52] hereof).  The effect of his Honour's analysis was that the assistance was of a low level.  Insofar as the murder investigation and retrieval of some stolen items was concerned, the assistance was of no practical value.  The identification of the radical Islamic cleric was not rated highly.  The only assistance of any practical value was the delivery of the 9 firearms and a quantity of ammunition and explosives.  Even then no information was provided as to their source.  Nevertheless, their surrender of those items was a benefit to the community given their potential to cause harm and to be used in unlawful activity.
71On the basis of that level of assistance, and the early pleas of guilty, it was well open to his Honour to allow a total discount of 30 percent where the individual components were not identified.  This is particularly so when his Honour took into account the matters in s23(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and had specific regard to s23(3) which is to the effect that any lesser penalty that is imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
72It should be noted that s23(4) does not prescribe a method or manner in which the discounting is to be achieved.  In  R v Gallagher [1991] 23 NSWLR 220 Gleeson CJ (with whom Meagher JA and Hunt J agreed) said: ""It is essential to bear in mind that what is involved is not a rigid or mathematical exercise, to be governed by ""tariffs"" derived from other and different cases but, rather, one of a number of matters to be taken into account in a discretionary exercise that must display due sensitivity towards all the considerations of policy which govern sentencing as an aspect of the administration of justice.""
Those remarks of Gleeson CJ are, of course, qualified by s23(4).  Nevertheless, as Basten JA observed in R v Ehrlich v R [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [7] their ""tenor is not diminished"".
73As was further explained by Basten JA in Ehrlich at [11], such an approach is not erroneous because s23(4) ""says nothing as to the manner in which the discounting is to be achieved.  Indeed, on one view, the manner in which it is achieved is irrelevant:  the selected reduction can be expressed in a number of different ways, none of which is prohibited.""  The real issue with respect to the allowance of a discount on two bases is to avoid double counting of a particular element.
74In most cases it is also not helpful to speak of a level of discount as being generally available.  Such an approach makes assumptions about the matters to which the court must have regard in s23(2) and runs the risk of selective reliance on some authorities to the exclusion of others.  In R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342 Beazley JA said at [88]:
""88 ...  the focus should not be so much upon the precise numerical value of the discount but rather upon the question whether after all relevant matters have been taken into account, the sentence imposed is appropriate.""
75This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed on the co-offender referred to as OS1.
76The applicant submitted that he had a justifiable sense of grievance by reference to the limited difference between the undiscounted head sentence imposed on OS1 for Count 4 and on himself for Counts 1 and 2.  In making that submission, the applicant relied upon the finding by the sentencing judge that ""I am of the view also that the role of OS1 was ultimately greater than the role of the offender.""  (ROS 39.2)  The applicant also relied upon the difference in the quantity of prohibited drug which was supplied.  In his case (including the Form 1 offence) it was 1.549 kilograms and in the case of OS1, it was 2.156 kilograms.  In that regard, the applicant noted that the two amounts supplied by him, which were the subject of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, formed part of the large commercial quantity which OS1 supplied.
77The applicant submitted that by virtue of the different charges preferred against him (two charges of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) and OS1 (one charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) OS1 was arguably exposed to a more punitive sentencing regime.  In making that submission, the applicant accepted that the quantity of drugs supplied was not the predominant factor when seeking to ascertain the appropriate sentence.  He accepted that the role of the particular offender was of primary importance (Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584).  In that regard, he noted that his Honour found that the role of OS1 was greater than his.  He submitted that not only did OS1 supply a greater quantity of drugs over a longer period, but his role in the syndicate was greater.
78The applicant submitted that even if the Court were to conclude that no justifiable sense of grievance could arise as a result of the undiscounted head sentences, it should arise in relation to the non-parole periods imposed.  The applicant noted that as adjusted by this Court, as a result of his appeal, the non-parole period imposed on OS1 of 8 years and 9 months was significantly less than that imposed on him.
79The applicant submitted that his submissions as to the lack of parity between the sentence imposed on OS1 and that imposed on him, was buttressed by the reduction in the sentence imposed on OS1 by this Court.  As a result of that decision, not only was the head sentence significantly reduced but also the non-parole period.  The applicant emphasised the findings of this Court (at [59]) as to the importance of the role played by OS1 in the syndicate.
Consideration
80The issue of parity was carefully considered by the primary judge.  His reasons for concluding that ""in all of the circumstances here issues concerning parity of sentence with OS1 whilst relevant, have only limited application"" (ROS 51.1) were pertinent and fully supported that conclusion.
81When analysing the roles of OS1 and the applicant, his Honour ""ultimately"" concluded that the role of OS1 was greater than that of the applicant.  It is clear from his Honour's analysis that despite that conclusion the difference in their respective criminality was not great.  The distinguishing features seem to be that OS1 was sentenced for his involvement in additional supply offences and that his involvement in the supply transactions occurred over a longer period.  This should not obscure the findings as to serious criminality made against the applicant: he was involved in the facilitation of the negotiations and other arrangements for the supply of the prohibited drug.  His involvement in the syndicate went well beyond the period of actual supply, he was involved in the procurement of the drug for supply, he was involved in the delivery processes for the drug and its transportation to Melbourne, he played a significant role in the recouping of monies that were collected by others in Melbourne and he was able to bring some knowledge of the illicit drug trade into the negotiating process.  At times he organised others in effecting steps in the supply of the drug in Melbourne.
82His Honour's conclusion was:
""The involvement of the accused at the level of procurement, the nature of the discussions with his son at the time of procurement, the involvement of the offender in the collection of monies, his overseeing role at times and the provision of assistance to those effecting the transactions support the conclusion that, in those supplies that he was involved in, he was at the nucleus of the organisation of the supply.""  (ROS 36.9)
83The primary judge found that there were limitations when comparing the sentences imposed on OS1 and the applicant.  His Honour referred to prosecutorial decisions as to the groupings of particular amounts of drug.  In the case of OS1, the effect of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion was to group a number of supplies together so that they amounted to a charge of supplying ""a large commercial quantity"" of the drug.  In the case of the applicant, the effect of the prosecutorial decision was to treat the two supplies as separate offences so that neither ever amounted to a ""large commercial quantity"".
84His Honour took into account as significant that included in the charges brought against OS1 was a completely separate but objectively serious offence of aggravated break enter and steal.  The importance of that consideration was that it must have played a part in the application of the principle of totality when OS1 was sentenced.  When applying the principle of totality, not only would the sentence for the aggravated break and enter have been adjusted downwards, but also the sentence for the ""supply a large commercial quantity of drug"" in Count 4.
85When considering the effect of the re-sentencing of OS1 by this Court, one needs to take into account the Court's reasons.  Before any consideration of an increase in the discount arose, this Court decided that the start point for the sentences imposed was excessive in that insufficient weight had been given to the subjective circumstances of OS1 and because excessive weight had been given to the standard non-parole periods contrary to Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The applicant did not have the benefit of such considerations, in particular, the applicant's subjective case was significantly weaker.
86The difference between the subjective cases of OS1 and the applicant is stark.  The applicant committed his offences while on parole for a serious offence of an almost identical kind, i.e. supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin).  Not only was the breach of parole a separate aggravating feature but the previous conviction for such a serious offence while still on parole gave rise to the considerations identified in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477 where the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey JJ) said:
""14 ... The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed...  The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.  It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.""
87This was an important difference between OS1 and the applicant and ""constituted part of the qualitative and discretionary judgment required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders"" referred to by the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen  [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [32].
88It follows that there is no proper basis for the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance by reference to the sentence imposed on OS1 when contrasted with the sentence imposed on him.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
89The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

This is an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the district judge dismissing the plaintiffs` claim against the defendant for damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of a collision between a pick-up van No GF 6713Y driven by the defendant and a motorcycle No AZ 3705 ridden by the second plaintiff with the first plaintiff as pillion rider.
The collision occurred along Clementi Road on 28 August 1982 at about 4.30pm near the entrance to Ngee Ann Technical College (NATC). At that junction, Clementi Road was a dual carriageway with three lanes going towards Bukit Timah Road and the other three lanes going in the opposite direction. Both the second plaintiff and the defendant reported the accident separately to the traffic police a few hours after the accident. The second plaintiff`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 1630 hours at Clementi Road, I was riding my motorcycle carrying one pillion (tel: 4684659), at a speed of about 60 km/h, travelling at the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713 when it turned without giving signal and I could not avoid but collided onto the front left side of the pickup.
 
 
 
The motorcycle fell and my pillion was injured. Ambulance conveyed us to Alexandra Hospital. Nobody was injured in the pick-up. The pick-up was dented slightly on the left front part. No rain and visibility clear. That is all.
The defendant`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 4.15pm, I am driving along Clementi Road intending to make a left turn to Ngee Ann College. Whilst driving, before I made a left turn to Ngee Ann College, I switched on my left signal indicator, suddenly a motorcycle AZ 3705C came on my left side, whilst I was about to turn, the said motorcycle grazed onto the left side of my motor pick-up. As a result the motorcyclist`s pillion was injured, on the hand and right leg. My motor pick-up left side was damaged, the side mirror broken.
 
 
 
At the trial, the testimony of the second plaintiff was substantially the same as what he had said in his police report save for the elaboration that the traffic was moderate and that the pick-up van was travelling in the middle lane of the three-lane road going towards Bukit Timah Road when the van turned suddenly into the entrance into NATC. He also said that he was not trying to overtake the van and that he could not remember which part of the van he collided into. He was asked to mark (which he did) the point of impact with an `X` on the police sketch plan of the scene of accident. The first plaintiff, in his testimony, corroborated the evidence of the second plaintiff. He remembered seeing a blue shadow suddenly moving across the path of the motor-cycle.
The defendant testified that when he was approaching NATC, he signalled, looked at the rear view mirror and then turned left into the entrance to NATC, that as he was doing so, the motorcycle collided into his van. He also said that before he made the turn, he was travelling on the innermost left lane. Under cross-examination, he claimed (a) that he was travelling on this lane all the way after turning into Clementi Road from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim; (2) that he switched on the indicator light about four to five car lengths from the entrance into NATC; (3) that on looking at his rear mirror he saw a motor car, but not the motorcycle, behind him travelling in the same lane; and (4) that he did not look at the left wing side mirror before he turned. The defendant had two passengers in his car at the time of the accident. One of them appeared as a witness to testify (1) that the van had travelled for about two miles on the extreme left lane whilst keeping to the centre of the lane; and (2) that the defendant did signal before turning left into NATC as he heard a `tick tick` sound.
At the end of the trial, the district judge found that the defendant was not negligent and that the second plaintiff was wholly to blame for the collision. In his grounds of decision, he gave the following reasons for his finding: 
 
The plaintiffs and defendant told conflicting stories. Each party was trying to put the blame on the other. In order to verify the evidence the court had to rely on evidence such as the police report. The second plaintiff stated in his report that he was travelling on the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713Y. The vehicle turned without giving signal. The defendant said that while he was about to turn the motorcycle grazed his left side. He had switched on his left indicator.
 
 
 
From the above it clearly showed that the second plaintiff was following behind the defendant. Both he and the defendant were travelling on the left lane. While the defendant was turning the plaintiff must have grazed him and then landed in the position marked `M`. There was a scratch mark leading to position `M`. The second plaintiff confirmed under cross-examination that the collision took place at the point marked `X`. Obviously, the second plaintiff was trying to overtake the defendant on the left side. From the point of impact and the scratch mark the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, otherwise on a head to side collision the motorcycle would remain at the point of collision. This confirmed that the defendant did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane to the left lane as alleged by the second plaintiff. Hence, the second plaintiff was the sole cause of the accident. He must have tried to overtake the defendant who was turning to its left, then grazed the defendant`s vehicle and landed on point marked `M`.
Counsel for the plaintiffs have submitted that the findings of fact of the district judge were inferential findings and that he was in error in making such findings. It is well established that an appellate court will not normally disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge based upon an evaluation of the oral testimonies of the parties and their witnesses as he is a far better position to assess their credibility having seen and heard them. However, where the findings of fact on which the decision is based are themselves inferences from primary facts, the appellate court `is in as good a position, or as bad a position, as the trial judge to form a view as to what happened`(per Thomson CJ in 
 Foong Yit Yoon v Yap Tiam & Anor 
 
[1963] MLJ 104
 at p 108).
Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted before me that the district judge`s finding that the defendant was not negligent was based not on his assessment of the truth or otherwise of the parties who gave evidence, he being unable to come to any conclusion as to whom to believe, but primarily on inferences drawn from the police reports of the second plaintiff and the defendant.
I agree. The extract I have quoted from the trial judge`s grounds of decision shows that the findings of the trial judge upon which he found the second plaintiff was solely to blame for the collision were as follows: (1) the pick-up van was on the extreme left lane of the road and the second plaintiff was following it on the same lane; (2) the collision occurred at the point `X` on the sketch plan as marked by the second plaintiff; (3) from the point of impact and the scratch mark leading to the final position of the motorcycle, `M`, the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, ie on a head to side collision, as the motorcycle would have stopped dead at the point of collision; in other words, it was not a head to side collision; (4) from this, it would follow that the motorcycle must have been trying to overtake the pick-up van; and (5) therefore the van did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane.
Every single finding of fact set out above is an inferential fact. This court is therefore in as good a position as the trial judge to assess the correctness of these findings of fact. The trial judge did not believe the second plaintiff`s version of how the collision occurred primarily because it could not have occurred in the manner described by him having regard to the point of impact as marked by him on the police sketch plan. In my view, the trial judge was wrong in accepting as correct the point of impact as marked by the second plaintiff. The trial judge should have, in the light of the other objective evidence, considered whether the second plaintiff`s account was consistent with the other objective evidence. The second plaintiff obviously had a faint recollection of an event which had occurred more than five years earlier. This is proved by his candid admission in his evidence in chief that he could not even remember where his motorcycle had collided into the pick-up van.
To make it easier to follow my analysis, I annex hereto a copy of the sketch plan. In my view, the point marked `X` could not be the point of impact because it is well beyond the point at which the van was damaged. According to the report of the traffic police who inspected the scene of the accident as well as the two vehicles immediately after the accident, the pick-up van was damaged in three places, viz (1) the front rearside door dented; (2) front rearside bumper dented; and (3) rearside wing mirror dented. It must therefore follow that the point of impact was at a spot before the spot marked `X`. The position of the van as shown in the sketch plan merely showed its position after and not before the collision. The van had come to a stop after the collision but it is a scientific fact that no moving force like a motor vehicle in motion can stop dead unless it meets an irresistable force, even if its brakes are 100% effective. The second plaintiff`s marking should have been rejected as an obvious error. It follows that the second plaintiff`s description that the collision was a head to side collision was consistent with the objective evidence. In fact, and this was also ignored by the district judge, the defendant in his police report had also, like the second plaintiff, made a tick against the printed description `head to side` collision.
On this basis, how did the collision occur? It could only have happened if the van turned into the path of the motorcycle. That this was how the accident occurred was confirmed by all the witnesses including the parties to the action. The question is whether the second plaintiff attempted to overtake the defendant, as found by the district judge, or whether the defendant turned his van suddenly into the entrance of NATC.
In my view, any finding on this is dependent on the relative probabilities of the testimonies of the parties and their witnesses in the light of such other objective evidence as may be relevant. At the entrance to NATC, the width of the three-lane road was 3.90m. The width of the van was 1.60m. The motorcycle was not measured but its width must have been one to two feet. If, as was alleged by the defendant`s witness, the van had been travelling in the centre of the left lane all the way from Jalan lbrahim up to the point of collision, that would leave to a vehicle following the van a free passageway between the curb of the road and the van of about 1.15m. Therefore, if the second plaintiff had been trying to overtake the van, he was doing an extremely hazardous and reckless act. There is no basis for coming to this conclusion. If he had wanted to overtake, it would have been easier and safer to overtake on one of the other two outer lanes.
However, the district judge in effect came to this conclusion by finding that the defendant was travelling on his innermost left lane because the second plaintiff had stated in his police report that prior to the accident, he was travelling behind the van. This inference is not irresistible. If X says that he is travelling on the left lane behind Y who says that he is travelling on the left lane, both X and Y would be travelling on the left lane if both are found to be telling the truth. In this case, the second plaintiff testified that the defendant was travelling in the centre lane. The defendant, of course, denied this and said that he was travelling on the left lane. But, the district judge made no finding as to who was telling the truth. He merely inferred from these two statements that both the second plaintiff and the defendant were travelling on the same lane.
Now, of course, the word `behind` is ambiguous when used to describe, without more, a vehicle following another vehicle on a road with more than one lane going in the same direction. In the present case, it was used by an English speaking constable in interpreting the words of the second plaintiff spoken in a different language. In court, the second plaintiff had explained what he meant when he testified that he was behind the van which was travelling in the centre lane. There is no inconsistency between this statement and what he had said in his police report. The district judge should have made a finding as to where the defendant was travelling just before the collision.
What then was the probability, on the evidence of the defendant having been travelling on the innermost left lane as he had alleged? Here, the district judge has failed to take into account the evidence of the defendant on a related point. The defendant admitted that when he looked at the rear mirror he never saw the motorcycle. There are only two possible reasons to explain why he did not see the motorcycle. The first is that he never looked into the rear mirror at all before turning. The second is that he looked but since the motorcycle was travelling on his left, he could not see the second plaintiff. If the first explanation is correct, the defendant was lying. If the second explanation is correct, the more probable inference would be that the defendant was then travelling on the centre lane and the second plaintiff on the inner lane. That would explain why the defendant never saw the motorcycle. In my view, that is certainly a more probable explanation than to infer that the second plaintiff was doing a dangerous act by riding side by side the defendant`s motorvan and trying to overtake the defendant.
For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the correct inference to draw from the evidence was that, on a balance of probabilities, the defendant had suddenly swerved left from the middle lane into the entrance of NATC and caused the second plaintiff to collide into the van. In my view, the defendant was in breach of r 74 of the Highway Code. He was wholly to blame for the accident.
The appeal is allowed with costs here and below. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs. As the trial judge has not assessed damages, I remit the case back to him for such assessment.

     REGINA v Leanne Maree MOORE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence passed by her Honour Judge Latham DCJ at the Campbelltown District Court on 11 February this year. 
     
      
    2    Before her Honour the respondent maintained a plea of guilty which she had first made on 4 August 1999 to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug; namely, methylamphetamine in that she had in her possession an amount of the drug which was not less than the trafficable quantity. Her plea first recorded on 4 August 1999, was not a plea made at the first available opportunity. 
     
      
    3    Her plea on 4 August 1999 was on a day when her matter was set down for trial. I shall revert to the significance of the timing of the plea later in my reasons. 
     
      
    4    The charge was laid pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. The maximum penalty is fifteen years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. It follows that the crime in question is one which has significant standing in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    5    Together with the charge of supply prohibited drug the respondent asked her Honour to take into account two counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm. This her Honour did. In the event, her Honour sentenced the respondent to a Community Service Attendance Order of some thirty-six hours. 
     
      
    6    The Crown's prime submission is that the sentence imposed by her Honour is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7    The facts of the matter are in relatively short compass. As a consequence of investigations carried out, police executed a search warrant at premises at number 9 Billikin Way, Ambarvale, at which premises the respondent resided. At the time when police made entry to the premises they found the respondent home and also, on entering, they came across a gentleman by the name of Mark Gardner who was engaged in the use of a computer in the premises. 
     
      
    8    A search carried out by police discovered methylamphetamine together with paraphernalia not inconsistent with drug dealing. The amount of methylamphetamine found weighed 53.9 grams, in one bag, and .07 grams in another bag. Later analysis showed that the pure quantity of methylamphetamine in the bag containing 53.9 grams was of a much lesser weight. 
     
      
    9    However, the New South Wales statute, unlike that of the equivalent statute of the Commonwealth, deals with weight in admixture and not in pure weight. The weight of drug found took it squarely within the bounds of s 25(1) as being an amount not less than a trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    10    In a record of interview carried out by police shortly after the apprehension of the respondent she admitted that she had supplied the drug to a friend on an occasion. The scales which were found which, as I have said, are part of the paraphernalia of drug dealing, she claimed she used for weighing aspirin. 
     
      
    11    I might say that the scepticism of this excuse advanced by the Crown before this Court this morning is a scepticism perhaps which could be easily shared. 
     
      
    12    Be that as it may, the plea of guilty in the circumstances was one which overcame some difficulties which the Crown may have had in proving its case. The prime difficulty which I would point to is the fact that at the time of her apprehension there was another adult in the house, the gentleman Gardner, and it may well be that in the course of the trial the Crown may have had some difficulty in establishing that it was the respondent rather than Gardner who was the person guilty of supply. 
     
      
    13    Having said that, there are a number of features in her Honour's sentence which cause disquiet. The Crown rightly submitted that her Honour made no reference to either general or personal deterrence in her sentence. 
     
      
    14    This Court has, on many occasions, indicated that in cases of drug supply, questions of both general and personal deterrence are matters which the Court should take into account: see Regina v Clark, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 15 March 1990, as an example of this Court's attitude towards deterrence in drug matters. 
     
      
    15    Secondly, her Honour, in delivering her reasons, clearly stated that she was giving maximum weight in terms of mitigation to the respondent's plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16    While it would be appropriate for her Honour to have given weight of some significance to the plea of guilty, to give full weight to a plea of guilty where that plea was not made at the earliest opportunity, in my view, is a matter of error. Here when the plea was entered on 4 August 1999 the case was set down for trial. Expense, no doubt, had been incurred in arranging witnesses to be present and other matters of preparation for trial which necessarily involved the expenditure of public funds. Indeed, the fact that the plea was not made at the first available opportunity is contra-indicative of absolute contrition. 
     
      
    17    Having said that, it would have been appropriate for her Honour to have taken the plea of guilty into account by way of mitigation but not to give that plea the weight she did. 
     
      
    18    The Crown also relied upon a submission that the respondent, by her statement in the record of interview that the scales found on the premises were used for the weighing of aspirin, is an indication of lack of contrition. As I have indicated earlier, the only admission made by the respondent which went directly to supply was the fact that she conceded to police that she had in fact supplied the subject drug to a friend. 
     
      
    19    Her Honour was greatly influenced, as she made transparently clear in her reasons, by the respondent's personal circumstances. A report from a cardiologist indicated that the respondent is suffering from a very profound cardiological condition, so profound that the morbidity rate flowing from that condition is in the order of twenty per cent a year. It is also very disabling, so disabling that in a pre-sentence report it stated that her physical condition would prevent her carrying out work under a Community Service Work Order. 
     
      
    20    This induced her Honour to make an order of a Community Service Attendance Centre Order which, of course, means that the respondent is not required to carry out any work in the discharge of her obligations under that order. 
     
      
    21    Also her family circumstances were of importance to her Honour. The respondent has children. One of those children is, regrettably, under notice by police and care of those children is a matter of some conjecture should the respondent be incarcerated. 
     
      
    22    For myself, I am of the view that her Honour perhaps overstated the situation when she said, in sentencing: 
     
      
       
        
        But for her health condition and her genuine contrition, I would have imposed a sentence of periodic detention."" 
        
       
      
    23    I am of the view that the sentence passed is inadequate. However, having regard to the medical condition of the respondent and the principles of double jeopardy, I am of the view that this is a case where the court should exercise its discretion and dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    24    I would thus propose that this Court should make an order dismissing the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    25    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    26    GREG JAMES J: I do also. 
     
      
       
      
    27    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was an appeal from the decision of the district judge when she convicted the appellant on four charges. Of these four charges, one charge related to an offence of cheating, punishable under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). The other three charges related to the appellant’s failure to submit changes of particulars to the Registrar of Companies and Businesses, as required under s 12(1) of the Business Registration Act (Cap 32, 2001 Rev Ed) (“BRA”) (an offence punishable under s 23(b) BRA). Additionally, two charges for a breach of s 12(1) BRA were taken into consideration and one charge for an offence of cheating punishable under s 420 PC was withdrawn. The appellant was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on this withdrawn charge. The appellant was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and forfeiture of his computer in relation to the cheating charge and fined $4,000 for each of the three BRA charges, in default of which four weeks’ imprisonment per charge would be imposed. The appellant appealed only against the imprisonment sentence imposed in respect of the cheating charge. At the end of the hearing, I allowed the appeal and reduced the term of imprisonment to six months. I now give my reasons.
The facts
2          The appellant (“Sunil”) had downloaded the website of Power & Motion Control Pte Ltd (“PMC”) onto his own website, EconSingapore. This was a fact unknown to PMC and the victim, one Kevyan-Alf, a managing director of M/s Kevyan-Alf & Co, a company based in Tehran, Iran. Sometime in December 2002, Kevyan-Alf placed an order for Vickers Cartridge Kits through the website of PMC. However, Sunil was able to access Kevyan-Alf’s order form. He used the particulars from Kevyan-Alf’s order form to correspond with Kevyan-Alf. Sunil falsely represented to Kevyan-Alf that his company, the fictitious Universal Computers, was an agent of the sole distributor of Vickers products in Singapore and that he would be able to supply the Vickers Cartridge Kits for the sum of US$42,000 (equivalent to S$73,428.60).
3          Kevyan-Alf agreed to Sunil’s representation and transferred the sum of US$42,000 to Sunil’s Standard Chartered Foreign Currency Account 
via
 telegraphic transfer. However, Sunil did not deliver the Vickers Cartridge Kits.
4          Sunil’s scam was discovered and he was charged for committing an offence of cheating. Sunil pleaded guilty to the charge at an open court hearing before the district judge on 8 October 2003. He entered a plea in mitigation on 10 October 2003. The mitigation focused on the fact that Sunil had made full restitution prior to pleading guilty, had pleaded guilty and was a first offender. The Prosecution, however, contended that the amount of money involved was large, that the victim was a foreigner and that a sophisticated scheme was employed.
The decision below
5          The district judge imposed the maximum imprisonment sentence of 12 months under s 417 PC. In deciding on the sentence, the district judge took three factors into account. First, she agreed that Sunil had employed a sophisticated scheme that involved a degree of planning and information technology (“IT”) skill to commit the offence. This, the district judge found, was an aggravating factor.
6          Second, the district judge noted that the amount involved was large. In this regard, she noted that the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated, the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court. She relied on the holding in the case of 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
 in arriving at this conclusion.
7          Third, and, as the district judge emphasised, most importantly, the offence involved the misuse of the Internet environment. The district judge expressed concern that the Internet was a particularly open and vulnerable platform where crimes were easy to commit, but their detection and investigation difficult. The district judge referred to the case of 
Tay Kim Kuan v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 567
 when she made this point.
8          Additionally, the district judge emphasised that commerce on the Internet required special protection as a growing and lucrative medium of business. She opined that as Singapore developed as a global commercial centre, it was vital that the e-commerce environment was kept secure and that breaches were viewed with seriousness. In respect of this point, the district judge relied on 
dicta
 in 
PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 
[2000] 1 SLR 34
. That case involved a young respondent who had hacked into computer systems. In emphasising the need for a sentence that reflected the objective of general deterrence, I had stated in that case that the anti-social conduct displayed by the respondent in 
Muhammad Nuzaihan
 not only undermined public and international confidence in the commercial integrity and viability of our computer systems, but also gravely compromised Singapore’s efforts to position itself as a global e-commerce hub. The district judge censured Sunil’s conduct in this regard, and emphasised that he had damaged the reputation and standing of PMC by his deception.
9          Finally, the district judge stated that the mitigating factors brought up by Sunil had to be balanced against considerations of public interest. She stated that public interest, in this case, involved the need to deter other like-minded individuals who may be tempted to subvert the e-commerce environment. Additionally, there was a need to signal to the international commercial community that the Internet environment was an important medium for business, the safety and security of which was jealously guarded by the local courts. In this regard, the district judge held that the maximum imprisonment sentence of 12 months was necessary and sentenced Sunil accordingly.
10        In imposing this maximum sentence, the district judge relied on the judgment in 
Sim Gek Yong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 537
. There, I had stated that the court ought to impose a maximum sentence whenever the nature of the offence and the circumstances so warranted it, as opposed to restricting such sentences to the “worst case imaginable”. In this respect, a range of conduct had to be identified and the maximum sentence would be imposed on the most serious instances of the offence in question.
Sunil’s appeal against sentence
11        Essentially, Sunil made several points in contending that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. He appealed for the imprisonment sentence of 12 months to be substituted with a fine, or in the alternative, with a short custodial sentence and a fine. I observed each of Sunil’s arguments and dealt with them accordingly.
Argument 1:   Sunil had made full restitution, showing remorse.
Argument 2:   This was a one-off offence and not a series of offences in which a public institution had been deceived.
Argument 3:   Sunil had no antecedents.
12        Here, Sunil argued that the district judge had not fully appreciated or given sufficient consideration to the various mitigating factors he had raised at trial. However, I noted that the district judge had indeed taken into account the fact that Sunil had made full restitution, had no antecedents and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The district judge had also emphasised that such mitigating factors were to be balanced against considerations of public interest.
13        It is true that from the district judge’s grounds of decision alone, it was difficult to identify the weight that had been attached to the fact that Sunil had made full restitution and had no antecedents. The district judge had mentioned these mitigating factors in passing when she balanced them against the specified considerations of public interest. To that extent, the grounds of decision were not highly elaborate. However, a lack of elaboration, without more, did not mean that the district judge had not considered these mitigating factors when arriving at her decision. To that extent, I disagreed with Sunil’s suggestions.
14        As for the point that the offence was one-off and that a public institution was not deceived, the trial notes of evidence and the written plea in mitigation (prepared for the trial) did not indicate that this point was brought up at the time of the trial. As such, Sunil’s argument that the district judge did not give this point sufficient consideration was not tenable. Instead, I found that the district judge had probably already given sufficient consideration to this fact among others when she engaged in the balancing exercise between the mitigating factors pleaded and the specified public interest considerations.
15        At this juncture, it is necessary to understand that it would not be plausible to expect a judge to lay out every possible mitigating factor on the facts, especially where these factors were not argued by an appellant (or an accused for that matter). This would be tantamount to expecting a judge to function as defence counsel for a represented accused. Accordingly, I rejected Sunil’s arguments in this regard.
Argument 4:   The district judge had placed undue reliance on the fact that the offence “was a fairly sophisticated one which took a degree of planning and IT skill”. This was a case of simple deception and nothing more.
Argument 5:   The district judge had placed too much emphasis on the fact that the offence involved the misuse of the Internet environment.
Argument 6:   Although the offence was committed by the misuse of the Internet, the nature of the offence committed by its misuse was not one in which detection and investigation were difficult.
Argument 7:   The district judge had misapplied the dicta in the cases of Tay Kim Kuan
 
and Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin.
16        I have provided a summary of the appellant’s next four arguments in the headings above. When I considered these arguments in total, I found that Sunil had a credible case. It is true that a substantial part of the district judge’s decision revolved around her opinion on the manner in which the cheating offence took place – the district judge had placed heavy emphasis on the fact that this case involved the misuse of the Internet environment. However, on the facts, I found that this case was essentially one of cheating 
simpliciter
 in accordance with the meaning of cheating as attributed to it in s 415 PC.
17        It was clear that Sunil had used the information he had gathered from Kevyan-Alf’s order form (submitted to the PMC website) in order to cheat Kevyan-Alf. There was evidence that there was further correspondence between Sunil and Kevyan-Alf before the telegraphic transfer of the US$42,000. At most, Sunil’s act of downloading the PMC website into his own website was incidental to the commission of the offence of cheating, as opposed to being a substantial aspect of the offence itself. There was no evidence to show that Sunil had downloaded the PMC website in order to cheat Kevyan-Alf.
18        It is probable, however, that Sunil had performed the initial download with an intention to commit some form of offence at some later point. However, the Prosecution did not prove this. In fact, the charge itself did not state the fact of misuse of the Internet environment or the downloading of the PMC website in its particularisation of the offence committed. I replicate the charge below:
DAC 043538/2003:
You, Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil M/45 yrs old NRIC No: S2170627-B date of birth: 9-6-1958 are charged that you, sometime in the month of December 2002, in Singapore and elsewhere, did cheat one Kevyan-Alf, a Managing Director of M/s Kevyan-Alf & Co, a company based in Tehran, Iran into believing that you are able to supply his company with new genuine Vickers Cartridge Kits, when you knew it was not true, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Kevyan-Alf to remit a sum of USD$42,000 (equivalent to Singapore Dollar $73,428.60) by means of telegraphic transfer to your Standard Chartered Foreign Currency Account, at No: 370 Alexandra Road, Singapore, which the said Kevyan-Alf would not have done had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence of cheating punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
20        Additionally, I was unable to entirely agree with the district judge’s opinion on the level of sophistication of the Internet misuse involved. There was no evidence that there was a high level of IT skill and planning involved behind the downloading of the PMC website. Without more, I could not conclude that Sunil’s act was as sophisticated as the district judge had made it out to be.
21        Further, the district judge’s opinion on the difficulty of detection and investigation resulting from Internet misuse was not a crucial point to a decision on the charge. At most, difficulty in detection and investigation could be an aggravating factor against an accused. However, in this case, as Sunil had argued, the offence was one of simple deception. Detection and investigation would therefore not have been as difficult as made out by the district judge because Sunil had actually communicated directly with Kevyan-Alf.
22        Sunil had also argued that the district judge had misapplied the 
dicta
 in the cases of 
Tay Kim Kuan
 and 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
. Although I disagreed that there was misapplication of 
dicta
 on the part of the district judge, I found that she had overstated the point regarding Internet misuse. Although the district judge’s application of the 
dicta
 with regard to a general issue of Internet misuse was accurate, the 
reasoning
 behind the decision in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 and 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 may not have been applicable on the facts of this appeal.
23        
Tay Kim Kuan
 involved an appellant who had sexual intercourse with an underaged girl whom he had met over the Internet. There, a deterrent sentence was imposed on the appellant. Although that case involved a misuse of Internet resources in the commission of a crime, the reasoning behind the deterrent sentence there was the protection of the young and gullible from the perils of the Internet, in the form of unscrupulous people who hid their true identities and remained faceless while boldly preying on such young people.
24        This was not the prevailing concern in the present appeal. Although, on the facts, a misuse of the Internet environment had occurred, the concerns here were different from those in 
Tay Kim Kuan
. This appeal involved an offence of cheating and not of sex abuse facilitated by Internet use. As such, the reasoning in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 ran at a tangent to that in this appeal. Although some of the 
Tay Kim Kuan
 issues involving Internet abuse was useful in order to understand the stance courts would take in pure Internet misuse cases, this same stance should not be applied 
carte blanche
 in every instance where an Internet or computer resource is misused, without first looking at the role such misuse played in the commission of the offence in question. In this appeal, the role of such misuse was peripheral. As such, the reasoning in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 cannot be applied directly to the set of facts in this appeal.
25        Likewise, the case of 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 involved a breach of ss 3(1), 5(1) and 6(1)(a) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 1998 Rev Ed). The offences committed by the respondent in that case involved unauthorised access to computer materials, unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer and unauthorised access to a computer service. A comparison of the facts of 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 and the current appeal clearly disclosed a large disparity in the nature of the offences committed. 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 involved pure computer misuse, as opposed to the cheating offence in this appeal.
26        As such, I found that the district judge, although not wrong in emphasising the need to control Internet misuse by imposing deterrent sentences in the appropriate cases, had over-emphasised the fact of Internet misuse in this instance. Therefore, the reasoning process towards her decision adopted conclusions and considerations from cases that were not directly applicable here. As a result, her decision did not take into account the fact that this was a case of pure cheating, with the slight involvement of Internet misuse along the way. As such, I found that although the district judge was correct in convicting Sunil on the charge, she had imposed a sentence that was manifestly excessive.
27        Having found that there were sufficient reasons for me to alter the sentence that had been imposed on Sunil, I also noted that Sunil had pleaded for the 12-month imprisonment sentence to be substituted with a fine. I could not allow this plea. In some cases, a particular sentence is deemed appropriate in order to relay a particular message. To state the obvious, a sentence should never relay a message that would suggest that it would be worthwhile to commit a crime. For instance, such a situation could arise if the punishment imposed were not sufficient in its severity to deter future similar offences.
28        Likewise, when a court is faced with a charge of cheating involving a sum of money akin to that in this appeal, it has to impose a sentence that has the potential to deter future similar offences. In that respect, a fine, though appropriate in other situations, would not have a deterrent effect in cases that are similar to this appeal. A potential offender should never be afforded the opportunity to ponder that he could cheat others of large sums of money and still “get away lightly” by being fined up to only a certain statutory limit. The criminal law should never become a “business” of sorts.
29        At this juncture, I felt it would be useful to refer to the case of 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
. That case involved cheating on a company share transaction. In that case, I rejected the appellant’s plea for a fine instead of a custodial sentence and mentioned the following at 928–929:
In my view, fines instead of custodial sentences can be imposed where the amounts involved are not of great magnitude or consequence, but when the operation smacks of something on a considerable scale, a custodial sentence must necessarily follow. … I think it should also be remembered that prosecutions for such offences normally take place in the district courts in which a district judge’s power to fine is presently limited to only $10,000. People who are minded to commit such offences of multiple share applications on a substantial scale must be discouraged from thinking that, if they are caught, they can simply surrender their ill-gotten gains and the worst that will then happen to them will be a fine of $10,000. For them, there must now be a custodial sentence.
30        I think the reasoning in 
Lim Choon Kang
 would apply in this appeal as well. As such, I felt that it was appropriate for a custodial sentence to be imposed on Sunil. I was left to decide on the length of this term of imprisonment. For the reasons I have stated, I found that a 12-month imprisonment sentence was manifestly excessive. As such, having regard to the circumstances in this case, especially the sum of money involved and the manner in which the offence was committed, I found that an imprisonment sentence of six months would be more appropriate.
31        I accordingly allowed the appeal on sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment from 12 months to six months. Sunil also requested for this imprisonment term of six months to commence after the Chinese New Year holidays. He mentioned that his wife was Chinese and that he wished to be with his family during the festive holidays. I saw no adverse reasons to disallow him some time with his family. I extended his bail and allowed the sentence to commence on 26 January 2004.

6,2704799,R v Hunter (No 13) [2014] NSWSC 1156,"ex tempore Judgment
1The Crown has made an application pursuant to s 32 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to permit the witness, Mr Gove Junior, to attempt to revive his memory in the witness box by way of reference to a document, namely Crown voir dire exhibit BB.  2I have considered the provisions of s 32 and, in particular, s 32(2)(b)(i)(ii).  I have also considered the aspects that need to be taken into account with regard to a grant of leave by way of s 192 of the Evidence Act.  Without running through each of those seriatim, I consider that those factors as a whole argue in favour of the application being granted.    3Furthermore, I regard the evidence of what the accused allegedly said in Livingston Avenue on the afternoon of 20 June 2011, in particular with regard to alleged threats of retaliations, as highly probative.   4In the circumstances, I do not see any basis upon which, by way of any discretion, the procedure pursuant to s 32 should not be permitted.  5In short, having taken into account ss 32, 55, 137, and 192 of the Evidence Act, I propose to grant the Crown leave to have the witness use voir dire exhibit BB in an attempt to revive his memory in the witness box.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The two appellants had on 25 March 1991 pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
You, Er Boon Huai and Lai Ah Kau, are charged that between 11.45am and 11.55am on 27 April 1988, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by transporting three packets containing a total of not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine in motor car PBE 9696 from the carpark at Block 75, Pipit Road, to the carpark serving Blocks 54 and 76, Pipit Road, via Circuit Road, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
They admitted the facts outlined by the prosecution and were convicted. The first appellant, Er Boon Huai, who was 33 years of age, was sentenced to 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The second appellant, Lai Ah Kau, who on the date of the conviction was 50 years and nine months old, was sentenced to 27 years` imprisonment. They now appeal against the sentences imposed.
The facts that gave rise to the offence were that on 25 April 1988, the second appellant telephoned the first appellant and told him that he had a buyer for three pounds of heroin at $6,400 per pound. The first appellant made the necessary arrangements with his supplier and told the second appellant that he would deliver the three pounds to the second appellant on 27 April 1988.
At about 11am on 27 April 1988, the first appellant collected the three pounds of heroin from near Beauty World in Bukit Timah area and drove to Pipit Road. He parked his car near Block 75, Pipit Road, and went up to the flat at Block 75, #09-227, where the second appellant was waiting. The buyer arrived at the flat shortly thereafter and left after speaking with the second appellant. The second appellant told the first appellant that the buyer had told him that he would collect the diamorphine later and had asked the second appellant to keep the diamorphine until collection.
The two appellants then went to where the first appellant`s car was parked. Rather than take the drugs from where the car was parked, the two drove off, went into Circuit Road, then returned to Pipit Road and stopped at the car park serving Blocks 54 and 76. The second appellant then took a brown plastic bag containing three bundles of the drug and went to the flat at Block 75, #09-227.
The first appellant drove off but was intercepted and arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau. Other officers raided the flat at Block 75, #09-227, arrested the second appellant, searched the flat and seized the brown plastic bag containing the three bundles that the second appellant had earlier been carrying. The contents of the three bundles on analysis by the Department of Scientific Services were confirmed to be diamorphine with a total weight of just under 255g.
The first appellant, in support of his appeal, told the court that he was remorseful and would never commit the offence again. He urged the court to show leniency. The second appellant told the court that he committed the offence because he was himself a drug addict and needed money. He told the court that he was a sick man and was undergoing treatment for hypertension and heart problems. In view of his age and medical condition he urged the court to reduce the term of imprisonment imposed on him.
The punishment prescribed by law for this offence was a maximum of 30 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a minimum of 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Bearing in mind the quantity of drugs involved and the minimum and maximum sentences prescribed by law, the sentence of 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on the first appellant could not be said to be manifestly excessive. We therefore dismissed the appeal by the first appellant.
The second appellant was over 50 years of age when he was convicted for this offence. In view of his age, he could not, by virtue of s 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), be punished with caning. The learned trial judge in sentencing the second appellant took the provisions of s 231 into account and imposed an additional three years` of imprisonment on the second appellant in lieu of the caning. This is evident from his grounds of judgment where the learned trial judge states: 
 
Lai, having passed the age of 50 when he appeared before me, was not liable to caning and in view of this, I felt an additional three years of imprisonment was justified and I accordingly sentenced him to 27 years` imprisonment.
 
 
 
Section 231 reads as follows: 
 
No sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments and none of the following persons shall be punishable with caning:
 
 
 
 
(a) women; 
 
(b) males sentenced to death; 
 
(c) males whom the court considers to be more than 50 years of age.
  
 
 
Section 231 places the three categories of persons stated therein in a special position in that any provision in any law imposing a liability to caning would not be applicable to such persons. That being so, unlike the first appellant, the maximum penalty that the second appellant was liable for was therefore 30 years` imprisonment (without any caning) and the minimum penalty was 20 years` imprisonment (without any caning). The additional three years` imprisonment imposed on the second appellant in lieu of the caning cannot be justified as the second appellant, in the absence of any facts to distinguish his case from that of the first appellant`s, must be sentenced to the same term of imprisonment as the first appellant for this offence.
We allowed the appeal against sentence by the second appellant and set aside the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this case, we considered that a term of imprisonment of 24 years from the date of his arrest would be the appropriate sentence to impose on the second appellant and we so ordered.
 Order accordingly

     Regina v Nedjelko Bikic 
      
       
     No: 70204/99 
    Judgment: on application for a separate trial (ex-tempore)1     HIS HONOUR: Mr Bikic has made a further application for a separate trial, and after careful consideration, I have determined that it must be granted. 
     
      
       
      
    2     A number of grounds were advanced in support of the application. However, I consider only one of them to be of substance: that is, the ground that he anticipates that his co-accused would support his alibi and he would wish to have them available as witnesses at his trial. That was the only ground argued at the time of the initial application which I determined on 1 December 1999. At that stage, however, no alibi notice had been filed and it was by no means clear what the nature of Mr Bikic's defence would be and in what manner his co-accused might support it. Since then notice of alibi has been filed and this application has been pursued accordingly. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The material before me is to the effect that Mr Bikic would claim at his trial that he was not present at the scene of the shooting or, indeed, at other places earlier in that day when other relevant events are said to have occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    4     I am informed that four of his co-accused have made statements, the effect of which is that, while they were present at least at the time of the shootings, if not at the time of earlier events, Mr Bikic was not. Those four co-accused, as I have said, have provided statements which were presented to me for the purpose of this application in sealed envelopes. Senior counsel for Mr Bikic submitted that I should examine that material in the sealed envelopes to determine the genuineness of this application but that the Crown should either have no access to them or should have access on a limited basis only: that is, on the basis that the material could not be used in the course of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    5     I do not consider it appropriate to examine the material in the sealed envelopes on either of those bases. It seems to me that, if that material is to be relied upon, it must be available to the Crown for all purposes as any other material tendered would be. That said, however, I have the assurance from the Bar table of senior counsel representing Mr Bikic that those statements reveal that each of those four co-accused is prepared to give evidence for Mr Bikic in circumstances where he himself is not placed in jeopardy, and that that evidence would tend to support Mr Bikic's case. Obviously, what weight the evidence might have is a matter I am not in a position to determine and which need not be determined at this interlocutory stage. 
     
      
       
      
    6     I observed when I dealt with the original application for separate trials that it is curious that there appears to be no reported cases in Australia dealing with situations such as this. I am indebted to the research that the Crown Prosecutor has undertaken since I made that observation, which confirms there is no reported case in Australia on this topic. The nearest one gets is an obiter observation in The Queen v Harbach [1973] 6 SASR 427 at 435 to the effect that the desire of one accused to call evidence from another might be a proper basis for directing a separate trial. 
     
      
       
      
    7     I was also referred to R v Knijff (1982) QdR 429, which dealt with the situation where the wife of the appellant’s co-accused was called but, as she was not a compellable witness against the co-accused, cross-examination of her by counsel for the appellant was hampered. In that unusual situation the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a separate trial was called for. The facts of that case, of course, are significantly different from here. 
     
      
       
      
    8     It is to Canada where one must turn for some guidance for the situation which confronts me. The Crown Prosecutor referred me to three decisions from that country. In the first, R v Quiring and Kuipers (1974) 19 CCC (2d) 337, the court held that a separate trial had been rightly refused in circumstances where it had been sought on the basis of the appellant's assertion that his co-accused might give material evidence in his defence. It seems, however, there was no material to establish that that co-accused was prepared to give evidence nor, if he were, what that evidence might be. The court recognised that a desire of one accused to call another in his defence might ground an order for separate trials but found that there was no such basis demonstrated in that case. 
     
      
       
      
    9     In R v Agawa and Mallet (1975) 28 CCC (2d) 379 the appellants had been found guilty of a killing in a prison. Agawa had sought a separate trial on the basis that Mallet made a statement to police tending to implicate himself in the killing but to exculpate Agawa. However, he made the statement with the rider that, ""if any of this is said outside, I will deny it"". A separate trial was refused and, on appeal, held rightly so. As the court pointed out, it was not clear what evidence Mallet would have given if he had been called and, in any event, his preparedness to give evidence on behalf of Agawa appeared to be no more than a mere possibility in the light of the rider he made at the time of his statement to the police. 
     
      
       
      
    10     On that occasion the court had regard to the strength of the Crown case against Agawa and concluded that anything Mallet might have said would have been of very little weight. The court appeared to have considered that that was a proper matter to assess in determining the separate trial application. However, it must be borne in mind that, in any event, this was a case on appeal after conviction where the court was also examining, with the benefit of hindsight, whether the trial had miscarried having proceeded as a joint trial. 
     
      
       
      
    11     On the other hand, in R v Boulet (1987) 40 CCC (3d) 38 a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that a separate trial should have been granted. In that case the appellant was tried with three others for the murder of a prison guard in the course of a riot. It seems that the appellant was initially charged alone and he indicated at a preliminary hearing, before the other three had been charged, that he may wish to call them as witnesses in his case. The Crown case turned primarily on the evidence of another inmate who claimed to have seen the appellant strike the guard. In seeking a separate trial, counsel for the appellant had informed the trial judge that the three co-accused would say that, while they were present at the scene, they had not seen the appellant commit any act of violence against the prison guard. Counsel for the other three accused indicated to the trial judge that anything they might say would not be to the appellant's benefit. Nevertheless, as I have said, the majority of the court were persuaded that, in those circumstances a separate trial should have been granted. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Beauregard JA (at 42) said that the trial judge should have accepted and acted upon the statement of counsel for the appellant from the Bar table that the other three accused might have given evidence favouring his case. The other judge in the majority was Vallerand JA, who at 47ff distinguished the two earlier Canadian cases to which I have referred. There is no precise parallel between the case of Boulet and the case with which I am dealing. However, I do find it of some assistance in the determination of this application. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The Crown’s opposition to the application is founded primarily on the assertion that the application is not made bona fide. Put bluntly, the Crown said this application is a ploy to improve Mr Bikic's chances of being granted bail. He has previously been unsuccessful on a number of occasions in bail applications. One of those occasions was before Adams J in April of last year. On that occasion his Honour refused bail but added the observation that the question of bail might be viewed differently if it appeared there would be any significant delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial.  
     
      
       
      
    14     The Crown submission is that the alibi material is false and has been fashioned simply to give weight to a separate trial application. Obviously, if that application were successful the trial of Mr Bikic would have to proceed after the trial of his co-accused and it is from that, the Crown says, that the sort of delay of which Adams J was speaking may well result. 
     
      
       
      
    15     The Crown relies on a number of other matters to impugn the bona fides of this application. On the first application, which I refused, Mr Bikic was represented by a different barrister from senior counsel who has represented him since. The effect of what was said from the Bar table on that occasion was that Mr Bikic would claim an alibi and would be supported by several of his co-accused because they were with him at the place where he claimed to have been at the time of the shooting. Clearly, that is not the case. As I have said, what I have been told is that the co-accused would acknowledge being at the scene but would deny that Mr Bikic was there. 
     
      
       
      
    16     However, in this application I have the affidavit of the solicitor who was previously acting for the applicant (although he no longer does), the effect of which is that counsel formerly briefed simply misunderstood Mr Bikic's instructions and the solicitor did not see it necessary to point that out to him at the time. Frankly, that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs but that is the situation to which the solicitor has deposed and he was not required for cross-examination on that or any other matter. 
     
      
       
      
    17     The Crown also relies upon the fact that the alibi notice was served late and, indeed, only after the judgment in which I refused the previous application for a separate trial. The Crown said that in the investigation by the police thus far the alibi does not appear to be supported. In particular, the Crown draws attention to a statement taken from one of the persons named in the alibi notice which would appear, in some respects at least, to be inconsistent with Mr Bikic's assertions in the alibi notice in respect of his movements on the occasion in question. 
     
      
       
      
    18     The Crown relies on what is said to be substantial evidence of Mr Bikic's involvement in the planning and execution of these crimes. Indeed, the Crown says that the evidence points to his being central to the organisation of the enterprise. In particular, there is eye witness evidence which, if accepted, clearly puts Mr Bikic at the scene and at another place earlier where it is said arrangements were made for the execution of the enterprise. 
     
      
       
      
    19     I should interpolate at this stage that the Crown also sought to rely in this application upon some evidence which it does not intend to lead at trial. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I could receive that evidence at this interlocutory stage pursuant to s75 of the Evidence Act. I say no more than that I do not consider it appropriate to do so, and I do not think that this is the sort of evidence to which s75 is directed. However, in any event, the outcome of the application would not turn on that material. 
     
      
       
      
    20     The Crown pointed out that part of its case is that Mr Bikic himself shot one of the victims, and the Crown Prosecutor submitted that his absence from the joint trial would distort the Crown case. The jury would not have the opportunity of seeing the totality of the case, including any answer that Mr Bikic might make to the evidence led against him. Of course, if Mr Bikic were granted a separate trial, the evidence of his having shot one of the victims would still be admissible in the trial of the others. Inevitably, directing a separate trial causes some distortion to the fabric of the Crown case. The question is whether the interests of justice override that. 
     
      
       
      
    21     All the matters the Crown Prosecutor raised in opposition to the application are of considerable weight and I have given them very careful thought. One might certainly entertain some suspicion about the true purpose for which this application is being made. As to that I can say only this. If the granting of this application is followed by a further bail application, that application will be dealt with on its merits in the light of the material then presented, although the delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial would be a relevant matter. 
     
      
       
      
    22     There are powerful reasons of policy for the joint trial of persons alleged to be involved in a joint criminal enterprise. For that proposition there are numerous authorities which I need not recite. The ultimate question, however, is what the interests of justice require. That involves balancing the interests of the community and the interests of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    23     In R v Middis & Ors (unreported 27 March 1991) Hunt J (as he then was) expressed the opinion (at p5):  
     
      
       
        
         
         An applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk (as opposed to a remote possibility) that there will arise in a joint trial prejudice of the type which - if it arises - would result in positive injustice to him. 
         
        
       
      
    24     I am presented with the situation in which senior counsel for Mr Bikic tells me that some at least of his co-accused could give evidence material to his defence. Those co-accused would not be compellable to do so at a joint trial. The only way to ensure their availability to Mr Bikic in his defence is to see them dealt with, one way or the other, before he goes to trial. 
     
      
       
      
    25     It is true, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, that a separate trial can be granted at any time. If, as it happened, all the co-accused chose to give evidence in a joint trial Mr Bikic's problem might well be solved. However, I have no way of knowing what course the other accused might take at their trial. 
     
      
       
      
    26     In all the circumstances, I consider it undesirable to wait until the trial is well under way to determine whether the interests of justice call for Mr Bikic's separate trial. As Hunt J observed in Middis at p6, sometimes in this circumstance it is not sufficient merely to discharge the jury in respect of a particular accused but it is necessary to discharge the jury in respect of the whole trial and to start again. 
     
      
       
      
    27     For those reasons I am satisfied that the application must be granted. Accordingly, I direct that Mr Bikic be tried separately from his co-accused and after they have been tried.

Introduction
 
This was an application by Mary Lwee Kwi Ling (‘Mary’), pursuant to s 223 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(‘CPC’), for the sentence imposed on her by the High Court in MA 146/2002/01 to be suspended until such time as the President of the Republic of Singapore has determined her petition, pursuant to s 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act (‘RSIA’), to have her sentence suspended.
Facts
2 Mary was convicted by the magistrate on a charge of criminal intimidation for uttering a death threat at one Quek Chin Huat (‘Quek’), while wielding a chopper at him, an offence punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). She was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with her sentence, she appealed. On 28 January 2003, I dismissed her appeal and enhanced her sentence to three months’ imprisonment. I also granted an application by her counsel for her sentence to commence only after the Lunar New Year Holidays, ie 4 February 2003. Mary had already commenced serving her sentence by the time this motion was heard.
3 Mary took out the present application for her sentence to be suspended, pursuant to s 223 of the CPC, because she intended to petition to the President. The basis of her petition was her discovery, after her appeal was dismissed, that one of the prosecution’s witnesses, one Kulwant Singh, had given false evidence implicating her in the trial before the magistrate. Kulwant Singh had since signed a statutory declaration admitting that he had been bribed by Quek to say, 
inter alia
, that he saw chopper marks made by Mary on a dining chair and on the door of her apartment, when in fact there were no such marks. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was investigating into the matter.
The issue
4 The issues before me were, first, whether the court had the power to suspend Mary’s sentence pursuant to s 223 of the CPC, and secondly, if the court had the requisite power, whether the power should be exercised in her favour.
The law
5 Section 223 of the CPC reads:
 
Subject to the provision of this Code and of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, every sentence of imprisonment to which section 221 or 222 apply shall take effect from the date on which it was passed, unless the court passing the sentence or when there has been an appeal the appellate court otherwise directs.
 
6 In my view, this section did not support Mary’s application for her sentence to be suspended after she has commenced serving it. The section provides that the court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment should 
commence
 on a date other than the date on which it was passed. In 
Lim Teck Leng Roland v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 4 SLR 61
, I ruled that a sentencing court could entertain an application under s 223 of the CPC for a deferment of the commencement of a sentence it passed even after a decision had been made previously on the commencement date of the sentence. The court was not 
functus officio
 in such a case and could alter its decision in respect of the commencement date of the sentence. This was because an order stipulating the commencement date of a sentence did not amount to a ""judgment"" that was unchangeable. However, once the offender has commenced serving his sentence, it is clear from the words of s 223 of the CPC that the court does not possess the power to re-consider its decision because it can no longer direct that the sentence shall commence on another date. Accordingly, since Mary had already commenced serving her sentence, she could not rely on s 223 of the CPC to defer the commencement of her sentence.
7 The relevant statutory provisions make it clear that the President has the sole prerogative to suspend the execution of a sentence, by virtue of his office. Section 8(1) of the RSIA, which is a constitutional document, reads:
The President, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the Cabinet –
a. grant a pardon to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the principal offenders, if more than one;
b. grant to any offender convicted of any offence in any court in Singapore, a pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or respite, either indefinite or for such period as the President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such offender; or
c. remit the whole or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed by law.
8 In recognition of this, s 237(1) of the CPC also provides the power for the suspension by the President of the execution of any sentence imposed by a court. That sub-section reads:
 
When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an offence, the President, acting in accordance with section 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act may at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which he has been sentenced.
 
9 Parliament, by these two provisions, granted the power to suspend the execution of a sentence only to the President. As a matter of constitutional law, the suspension of sentences are not part of the court’s functions and the court cannot usurp the prerogative of the President conferred by statute.
10 The Court of Appeal in 
Jabar v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 1 SLR 617
 also arrived at the same conclusion that the President, and not the courts, may exercise the powers under s 8(1) of the RSIA, although that decision was with respect to the power to order a stay of execution. The facts of the case were as follows: One Jabar, was convicted on a charge of murder with two others and sentenced to death. On appeal, his conviction was upheld. He petitioned to the President for clemency but the petition was rejected. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Jabar sought a stay of execution from the President when his co-accused claimed that he was solely liable for the murder. The stay was granted and Jabar filed a further petition for clemency. However, this petition was subsequently rejected as well. On the eve of the re-scheduled execution, Jabar filed an application to the High Court seeking a stay of execution of the death sentence on the basis that the execution was unconstitutional due to the prolonged delay in executing the sentence. The High Court dismissed the application. The President ordered a respite pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal which ruled that the courts did not have the power to order a stay of execution. At p 632C of the report, the court held that s 8(1) of the RSIA gave the President the exclusive power to order a stay of execution. Therefore, the court did not possess the power to do so. By this interpretation of s 8(1), the courts similarly do not have the power to order a suspension of the execution of a sentence as that sub-section only gives the President such a power.
Conclusion
11 As the court did not possess the power to suspend the execution of Mary’s sentence, it was unnecessary for me to consider whether the circumstances of this case warranted a suspension of the sentence. Accordingly, I dismissed the motion. I noted that Mary was not left without recourse and the proper mechanism for her to seek a suspension of the execution of her sentence was to petition directly to the President pursuant to s 8(1) of the RSIA.",2003-02-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

     REGINA v LEE WEST  
      
    Reasons for judgment3     HIDDEN J: The appellant, Lee West, was tried in the District Court with another man upon an indictment containing two charges: (1) robbery with corporal violence at the St George Bank at Ramsgate on 5 December 1997; and (2) on the same day, knowingly being carried in a Holden Commodore sedan which had been taken without its owner’s consent.  
     
      
       
       He was found guilty of both charges and custodial sentences were imposed. He appeals against conviction only. 
        
        
       The evidence 
        
       
      
    4     In the early afternoon of Friday, 5 December 1997 two men entered the St George Bank at Ramsgate Road, Ramsgate. One remained in the customer area while the other jumped over the counter, struck one of the tellers and seized a sum of money. The two men left the bank and were seen to drive away in the vehicle the subject of the second count, which was parked nearby and in which someone already occupied the driver’s seat. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant and his co-accused had been correctly identified as the men involved in the robbery. The appellant was said to be the man who had remained in the customer area of the bank. The witnesses to the robbery and the escape of the two men were shown arrays of photographs prepared by the police on video-tape. One of the tellers identified a photograph of the co-accused as the man who had jumped over the counter. Otherwise, none of the witnesses could identify either of the two men. However, the robbery was filmed by a bank security camera, and a number of police officers who had had prior contact with the appellant and his co-accused identified them in those photographs. This was the evidence upon which the case against the appellant turned. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The appellant gave no evidence and called no witnesses. However, he relied upon an electronically recorded interview conducted after his arrest, in which he denied any knowledge of the robbery and asserted that he was not in Sydney at the time. His case was developed though cross-examination of the police officers to whom I have referred, questioning the reliability of their identification of him in the bank security photographs.  
     
      
       
      
    7     The officer in charge of the investigation was Senior Constable Lynch. It was his evidence that in the afternoon of 8 December 1997, three days after the robbery, he obtained one of the bank security photographs. He immediately recognised the appellant as one of the men in it. He had spoken to him some months earlier, on 30 April 1997, at Glebe Police Station, although his evidence did not disclose how long he was in his company. He had also seen the appellant earlier on 8 December at the intersection of Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets Sydney, near the Downing Centre court complex. 
     
      
       
      
    8     When the appellant was at Glebe Police Station on 30 April, he was also seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch (apparently no relation to Senior Constable Lynch), Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge. Detective Senior Constable Porter said that he saw the appellant during the afternoon and the evening of that day, as did Detective Sergeant Lynch. Senior Constable Shoobridge said that he was in the appellant’s company for several hours. Detective Sergeant Lynch saw him again on three separate occasions during 7 August. He also saw him in the vicinity of the Downing Centre courts on the morning of 8 December. Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge were also at the Downing Centre that day and both saw the appellant inside the court building.  
     
      
       
      
    9     On 9 December, again at the Downing Centre, Senior Constable Lynch showed the bank security camera photograph to the other three police officers. Each gave evidence that he immediately recognised one of the men depicted as the appellant. Before the jury there was no evidence about the circumstances in which the appellant came to be at Glebe Police Station on 30 April or was seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch on 7 August. However, there was evidence that on 8 and 9 December he was at the Downing Centre as a defence witness in a trial which was then in progress. 
     
      
       
      
    10     By 12 December a number of further bank security photographs had been developed. On that day, Senior Constable Lynch showed all the photographs to Constable Carrick, who was stationed at Redfern. He gave evidence that he recognised the appellant in them. He said that he had seen and spoken to the appellant in the Redfern area a number of times during 1997. He also gave no evidence of the circumstances of those encounters, except to say that on several of those occasions he gave the appellant traffic infringement notices. 
     
      
       
      
    11     The other police officers were also shown the other photographs but, of course, the significant evidence was their recognition of the appellant in the single photograph which each of them was shown on 9 December. 
     
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
      
    12     The primary ground of appeal was that the evidence of the police officers’ identification of the appellant from the bank security camera photographs should have been excluded. This appeal was heard together with two others, in which it was argued that evidence of this kind is inadmissible for the same reasons as were advanced in the present case. One of those cases was R v Mundarra Smith [1999] NSWCCA 317 and Sheller JA dealt with the argument at paragraphs 12 to 24 of his judgment in that case, rejecting it. I respectfully agree with what his Honour has written and there is no need to repeat it here. 
     
      
       
      
    13     As in Smith, it was also argued on the present case that the trial judge ought to have excluded the evidence on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant: s137 Evidence Act 1995. Clearly, there was a danger of prejudice arising from the fact that the identifying witnesses were police officers, although the evidence was led in such a way as to minimise that prejudice as far as it could be. Nevertheless, its probative value was high. In determining to admit the evidence, the learned trial judge performed the balancing exercise required by s137 and I am not persuaded that he fell into error in his approach to the matter. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      
    14     There was also a ground of appeal that the jury’s verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. However, this ground was pressed only if the previous ground were successful, in which event there would clearly be insufficient evidence to support the convictions. That being so, this ground also must fail. 
     
      
       
      
    15     I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 

THE COURT: 

The  applicants,  Bruno  Grollo  and  Robert  Charles 

Howard, seek leave to appeal from orders of a single Judge of 

the Court.  Each order dism~ssed, on certain undertakings from 

the  respondents,  a  motion  for  an  interlocutory  injunction 

4 

restraining  the  first,  third  and  fourth  respondents  from 

carrying  into  effect, acting  upon  or  otherwise enforcing  or 

seeking  to  enforce  a  decision  or  order  made  by  the  second 

 respondent,^. constituting  the  Magistrates'  Court,  on-  21 

December  1993  for  the  compulsory  fingerprinting  of  each 

applicant.  The second respondent, Ms.  Dessau, is a Magistrate 

for the State of Victoria.  Her order was made on application 

under  s.464M  of  the  Crimes  Act  1958  (Vic)  by  the  first 

respondent, an officer of the Australian Federal Police.  Sub- 

ss. 464M(3),  (4) and (5) provide: 

., 

""(3) The  Court  may  make  an  order  directing  a 
suspect to give his or her fingerprints if 
the suspect - 

(a)  is  in  custody within  the meaning  of 

this Subdivision; or 

(b)  has been charged with an offence; or 

(c)  has  been  summonsed  to  answer  to  a 

charge - 

and the Court is satisfied as required by sub- 
section (4) or (5). 

(4)  The  Court  may  make  an  order  under  sub- 

section (3) if satisfied that - 

(a)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  suspect  in  respect 
of  whom  the  order  is  sought  has
--------
the 

committed 
whether 
indictable  or  summary,  for  which  he 
or  she  is  in  custody,  has  been

offence, 

(b)  a  fingerprint has  been  found  at  the 
scene of  the offence, on a victlm of 
the  offence or  on  an object used  in 
or  in connection with  the  commission 
of the offence; and 

(c)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  taking  of  the 
suspect's  fingerprints would  tend  to 
confirm  or  disprove  the  involvement 
of  the  suspect  in the  commission  of 
the offence. 

(5)  The  Court  may  make  an  order  under  sub- 

section (3) if satisfled that - 

(a)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  suspect  in  respect 
of  whom  the  order  is  sought  has 
committed the offence for which he or

(b)  the offence is an indictable offence; 

and 

(c)  there  is  reasonable  doubt  concerning 
the  identity  of  the  suspect  and  the 
taking  of  the  suspect's  fingerprints 
would dispel that doubt."" 

Each applicant has instituted a proceeding in this Court under 

s.39B  of  the  J u d i c i a r v   Act  1903  and  for  review  under  the 

Administrative  Decisions 

( J u d i c i a l   R e v i e w )   A c t   1977  of  the 

decislon of Ms. Bates to apply under s.464M of the C r i m e s   A c t  

1958  (Vic.),  and  the  declsion  of  the  learned  Magistrate  to 

order the compulsory fingerprinting of the applicants.  It was 

accepted on both sides before the learned primary Judge  (Gray 

J.)  that  the  applicant's  claims  in  the  proceeding  raise 

serious  questions  to  be  tried. 

In  the  light  of  that
--------
concession the learned primary Judge said: 

""[Tlhe  difficulty  arises  of  determining  where 
lies the  justice of  the case in relation to  a 
stay,  while  the  applicants  seek  to  vindicate

against them in the committal proceeding due to 
commence  on  11th  April  and  afterwards  in  any 
trial that may result. 

On  the  other  hand,  a  stay  altogether  will 
frustrate  the  investigative  process  and  will 
perhaps  delay  or  fragment  the  committal  and 
possibly  delay  any  resulting  trial,  in  the 
event  that  the  applicants  are  unsuccessful  in 
these proceedings."" 

His Honour then expressed the opinion that  ""the balance could 

be struck between those extreme positions"" by exacting certain 

undertakings  from the respondents to destroy the  fingerprints 

obtained  pursuant  to  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order  in  the 

event  that  the  applicants  should  ultimately  succeed  in  the 

proceedings  initiated  in  this  Court.  As  they  emerged  after 

further  discussion,  the  undertakings  which  prefaced  his 

Honour's  order in each application were:

resisting 

in 

In  the  light  of  those  undertakings,  Gray  J.  refused  the 

application for a  stay.  The applicants seek leave to  appeal 

from  that  refusal. 

It  was  accepted  that  the  principles 

governing applications to this Court for leave to appeal from 

an  interlocutory order of  a  single Judge  require  that  leave 

should only be  granted  if  the Full  Court  concludes that  the 

decision at  first instance was  attended with sufficient doubt 

and, if  allowed to stand, would work  a  substantial injustice 

to  the  applicant  for  leave.

unnecessary and indeed unwlse to lay down rigid 
and  exhaustive criteria.  The circumstances of 
different  cases  are  infinitely  various. 
We 
would  merely  repeat,  with  approval,  the  oft- 
cited  statement of  Sir Frederick  Jordan in  In 
re the Will  of F B  Gilbert  (dec)  (1946) 46  SR

'. . .  I am of opinlon that, . . . there is a 
material difference between an exercise of 
discretion  on  a  point  of  practice  or 
procedure  and  an  exercise  of  discretion 
which  determines  substantive rights.  In 
the former class of case, if a tight rein 
were  not  kept  upon  interference  wlth  the 
orders  of  Judges  of  first  instance,  the 
result would  be  disastrous  to  the  proper 
administration of  justlce.  The  disposal 
of  cases  could  be  delayed  interminably, 
and  costs  heaped  up  indefinitely,  if  a 
litigant with a  long purse or a  litigious 
disposition  could,  at  will,  in  effect 
transfer  all  exercises  of  discretion  in 
interlocutory applications from a Judge in 
Chambers to a Court of Appeal.'

is  safe to  say that the question of  injustice 
flowing  from  the  order  appealed  from  will 
generally  be  a  relevant  and  necessqry 
consideration."" 

For the applicants before this Court it was argued that, given 

the acceptance on both sldes that there was a serious question 

to be tried, his Honour erred in not  finding that the balance 

of  convenience  favoured  the  grant  of  an  interlocutory
--------
8. 

injunction.  That  error  was  said  to  consist  in  allowing  a 

purely  hypothetical  inconvenience  to  the  prosecution  to 

outweigh  a  positive  and  irreparable  prejudice  to  the 

appllcants if the fingerprints were taken before the committal 

hearing. 

d 

For  present  purposes  the  charges  against  the 

appllcants to be  considered are of  a  conspiracy between them 

and John  Flanagan to effect a purpose that is unlawful under 

a  law  of  the  Commonwealth,  contrary  to  s.86(1) (c) of  the 

Crimes  Act  1914  (Cth), and of a conspiracy between Mr. Grollo 

and  John Flanagan to commit  an offence against a  law of  the 

Commonwealth, contrary to s.86(l)(a)  of that Act.  A committal 

hear~ng in respect  of  those  charges  and  one other  charge  of 

conspiracy is to commence on 11 April  1994.  The case proposed 

to be proved is that Mr. Grollo, being engaged in dispute with 

the Australian  Taxatlon  Office  concerning  alleged  income  tax 

liabilities  of  companies  with  which  he  was  associated,  and 

having  been  made  the  subject  of  an  investigation  by  the 

Australian Federal Police  (""the A.F.P."")  into  allegations  of 

fraud by  him  in connection wlth  those  liabilities, conspired 

with  Messieurs  Flanagan  and  Howard  to  bribe  a  Detective 

Superintendent of the A.F.P.,  Lloyd Farrell, whom Mr. F-lanagan 

knew,  to  furnish  Mr.  Grollo  with  information  about  the 

investigation and about policemen and lawyers acting on behalf 

of  the  A.F.P.  and  the  Commonwealth  Director  of  Public 

Prosecutions, by  use of which  information Mr.  Grollo hoped to 

win success in the disputes which derived from the allegations
--------
9. 

of  income  tax  liabilities  and  income  tax  fraud.  Evidence 

will,  it  is  s a ~ d ,  be  led,  from  Mr.  Farrell  and  others, of 

requests  to  Mr.  Farrell  by  Mr.  Flanagan  for  information of 

that  kind,  and  of  offers  and  payments  of  bank  notes 

aggregating  thousands  of  dollars,  by  Mr.  Flanagan  to  Mr. 

Farrell, and  of  the provision  to Mr.  Flanagan by  Mr.  Farrell 

ofdinformation, apparently  of  the  kind  solicited, some  oral 

and  some  in writing.  It  is  to  be  alleged  in evidence  that 

some of the written material was  later seized by police under 

the authority of search warrants in places to which Mr. Grollo 

and Mr. Howard, who was  at relevant times an employee of  one 

of  the  companies  with  which  Mr.  Grollo  was  associated,  had 

access.  The evidence before Gray J. did not suggest that Mr. 

Howard's  fingerprints have been available to the police.  But 

there was evidence that fingerprints of Mr.  Grollo, furnished 

by  him  to  the  Victorian  Police  Force  in  support  of  an 

application by  him  for  a  firearms  licence, was  available to 

the A.F .P., and  that those  fingerprints had  been compared by 

the A.F.P. with fingerprints on documents seized under warrant 

and with  fingerprints on the bank  notes alleged to have been 
handed by  Mr.  Flanagan to Mr. Farrell.  . 
appeared  with  Mr.  J.  Beach  for  Mr.  Grollo,  supported  by  a 

Merkel Q.C.,  who 

number  of  submissions  his  contention  that  Mr.  Grollo  would 

suffer  irreparable prejudice  if  the order  for  fingerprinting 

were  not  stayed  and  were  later  set  aside.  One  subrniss~on 

postulated  that  evidence  might  be  given  on  the  committal 

hearlng  that  a  comparison  of  Mr.  Grollo's  fingerprints, 

obtained  under  the  Magistrates'  Court's 

order,  and
--------
10. 

fingerprints on one or more of the bank notes alleged to have 

been  passed  by  Mr.  Flanagan  to  Mr.  Farrell  showed  that  Mr. 

Grollo had handled one or more such notes.  In that event, it 

was submitted, the publication of a report of evidence of the 

result  of  that  comparison  in  the  committal  hearing  by 

newspaper. or  broadcasting,  to  persons  who  would  later  be 

members  of  the  jury  at  Mr.  Grollo's  trial,  would  gravely 

prejudice  his  right  to  a  fair  trial  if,  after  that 

publication, the Magistrates' Court's  order were set aside and 

the evidence were not admitted at the trial.  It was  further 

submitted  that  that  consideration  should  weigh  heavily  in 

favour of  staying the  order.  There  is, we  think,  force  in 

those  submissions.  But  the  question  arises  as  to  whether 

those, or any  similar, submissions were  advanced  before  Gray 

J. 

Shortly after the hearing of the motions for stay of 

the  orders  had  commenced  on  27  January  1994 before  Gray  J. 

Mr.  Weinberg  Q.C.,  who  appeared  with  Miss  Carlin  for  the 

respondents  other  than  Ms.  Dessau,  sought  to  tender  an 

affidavit  sworn by  Peter Barrington Kidd  on that  day.  From 

the  affidavit  and  exhibits  thereto  it  appeared  that  Mr. 

Grollo's  fingerprints  which  had  been  furnished  to  the 

Victorian  Police  in  support  of  his  firearms  licence 

application  had  been  compared  with  fingerprints  on  certain 

documents  (including  the  bank  notes  to  which  we  have 

referred).  On some of the documents Mr. Grollo's  fingerprints 

appeared, according to the exhibits, but not on any bank note.
--------
11. 

It further appeared that it was intended to tender evidence at 

the  committal  hearing  of  the  presence  of  Mr.  Grollo's 

fingerprints on the documents, as circumstances  incriminatory 

of him  in respect of the informations laid against him.  They 

included  documents  alleged  to  have  been  furnished  by  Mr. 

Farrell  to  Mr.  Flanagan as  contain~ng information  useful  to 

Mr .d.  Grollo.  Mr.  Merkel  requested  that  his  Honour  hear  in 

camera  the  respondents'  application  that  the  affidavit  be 

received  in  evidence  on  the  hearing  of  the  motion. 

The 

following dialogue then occurred: 

""MR  MERKEL: 
It  relates  to  certain 
material,  your  Honour,  that  is  sought  to  be 
relled upon in the committal. 

Yes. 

HIS  HONOUR:

MR  MERKEL:  No, but  it may  not be  admissible, 
and  it may  not be able to be  relied upon  and, 
in  effect,  your  Honour,  we  are  anxious  that 
there  by  no  publicity  concerning  the  matter 
pending a court properly considering whether it 
is  able  to  be  received.  The  application  we 
will  be  making,  your  Honour,  is  that  your 
Honour  should  not  receive  or  allow  this 
material to be relied upon and in any event if 
it is, your Honour, that it ought to be subject 
to  a  direction  if your Honour does  receive  it 
that  the  contents  not  be  disclosed, and  I  am 
constrained in making  that  application.  I do 
not  think  my  learned  friend  objects  to  the 
course  we  are  asking,  your  Honour,  it  is  in 
fact what happened in the Magistrates' Court.: 

A little later there was further dialogue: 

""MR MERKEL:  Your Honour, I think that where a

MR  MERKEL:  And  that  could  be  prejudicial  to

or was  the subject of a non-publication in the

trylng  to  conslder  how  I  can  deal  with  the 
matter, your Honour.

they are to have regard only to what they hear 
in  the  court  room  and  not  to  have  regard  to 
anything that they might or might not have read 
in the media.  Ii  I may  be  so bold  as to  say 
so, I think that the community generally has a 
healthy  distrust of  the  accuracy of  the media 
these days."" 

After  Gray  J.  had  read  the  affidavit  and  exhibits 

Mr.  Merkel  sought an order, pursuant  to  s.50  of  the  Federal
--------
13. 

Court of Australia Act  1976, that publication of the evidence 

contained  in  those  documents  be  forbidden,  on  the  ground 

afforded  by  the section that such an order was  ""necessary in 

order to prevent prejudice to the administration of  justice"". 

His Honour said to Mr.  Merkel  :  ""Your only suggestion can be 

that  somehow or  other publicity  of  this  might  prejudice  the 

trkal"".  Mr. Merkel agreed. 

When invlted by his Honour to state the relevance of 

the  affidavit  and  exhibits  to  the  application for  a  stay of 

the Magistratesr Court's  order Mr.  Weinberg polnted  out  that 

evidence  would  be  led  at  the  committal  hearing  that  Mr. 

Grollo's  fingerprints  were  on  certain  documents  (being 

evidence  derived  from  the  fingerprints  furnished  voluntarily 

on the application for a firearms licence), and submitted that 

in those circumstances media publicity about further evidence, 

based upon a clearer set of fingerprints obtained in pursuance 

of the order, would not significantly enhance any prejudice in 

the  minds  of  potential  jurors.  Mr.  Weinberg  did,  however, 

explain  to  his  Honour  that  if  the  clearer  fingerprints 

expected to be obtained under the order enabled the conclusion 

to  be  drawn  that  Mr.  Grollo's  fingerprints  were  on  a  bank 

note,  evidence  of  that  conclusion  would  afford  .""highly 

incriminating"" evidence.  As  Mr.  Weinberg put  it to Gray J., 

""it is  as  though one  had  a  gun which  has  been  used  for the 

commission  of  a  murder  and  a  fingerprint has  been  found  on 

it.""  Thus was his Honour's  attention drawn to a consideration 

which  some  might  think  important  by  counsel  of  great
--------
experience in criminal law. 

14. 

Mr.  Merkel  not  pressing  the  application under  s.50 

of  the  Federal  Court  of Australia  Act  1976, Gray  J.  invited 

counsel  to  put  their  submissions  for  and  against  a  stay 

without  finally ruling on the admissibility of  the affidavit, 

buB.on the footing that it would be admitted.  Mr. Merkel made 

no  reference, in his oral submissions, nor is there reference 

in  written  submissions  which  he  placed  before  Gray  J.  in 

support of  a stay, to the harmful effect on potential  jurors 

of  publication  of  evldence  derived  from  use  of  fingerprints 

obtained  under  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order. 

During 

subm~ssions which  he  advanced  in  reply  to  Mr.  Weinberg's 

submissions Mr.  Merkel  said  :  ""So we would  say, your Honour, 

that my learned frlend [Mr. Weinberg] waved before your Honour 

an  array  of  possibilities.  He  introduced  and  then  removed 

publicity, which was not part of our submission, your Honour"". 

We consider that Gray J. would  have understood those words as 

an abandonment of reliance on publication to potential jurors 

of evidence, given at the committal hearing, derived from use 

of  fingerprints obtained under the Magistrates' Court's  order, 

as  a  consideration  in  favour  of  making  the  stay  order  for 

which Mr. Grollo was applying.  Having regard to all that had 

been s a ~ d  during the hearing before those words were spoken by 

Mr.  Merkel,  we  do  not  consider  that  counsel  for  Mr.  Grollo 

should be permitted to place reliance on that consideration in 

support of the application for leave to appeal from the order 

Gray J. made, elther as showing error on his Honour's  part or
--------
as  showing  the  order  hls  Honour  made  to  be  productive  of 

substantial injustice to Mr. Grollo. 

15. 

Other  aspects  of  prejudice  to  Mr.  Grollo  which 

refusal of a stay of the Magistrates' Court's  order will cause 

-  and other aspects of substantial injustice to Mr.  Grollo if 

leave to appeal against the order of Gray J. be refused -  were 

summarised  in  written  submissions  to  this  court  on  Mr. 

Grollo's  behalf, thus: 

""10.  Substantial injustice has  been  caused  to 
the Applicant by reason of the stay being 
refused.  His  Honour  failed  to  give any

10.1  The denial of the stay would  carry

(v) 

to  be  committed  for  trial 
only  upon  evidence  able  to 
be used at his trial."" 

Each of  those considerations was  relevant to  the exercise of 

his  Honour's  dlscretlon.  The weight  to be  accorded  them was 

for his Honour to determlne.  That he did not expressly refer 

to them does not in my opinion show that he failed to glve any 

weight to them.  They are obvious upon a consideration of the 

circumstances  disclosed  to  Gray  J. 

And  his  Honour  was 

speaking ex tempore in resolution of what had been represented 

to be  an urgent application heard  in vacation.  In my opinlon
--------
17. 

Gray J. would not have been  in error if  he had  thought those 

considerations to be  of  relatively slight weight, as a matter 

of  reality,  in  the  circumstances  disclosed  by  the  evidence 

before him. 

.Two  considerations  of  greater  weight,  in  our 

ophion,  are  the  risk  of  prejudicing  the  minds  of  persons 

ultimately  becoming  jurors  at  Mr.  Grollo's  trial  by 

publication  of  evidence  subsequently held  to be  inadmissible 

at  that  trial,  and  the  risk  that  evidence  based  on  a 

comparison  of  fingerprints  obtained  under  the  Magistrates' 

Court's  order  with  fingerprints  on  the  documents  might  be 

admitted  in  evidence  at  the  trlal  notwithstanding  a  curial 

decision that  the  order was  invalld  or  should be  set  aside. 

As to the former risk, we have concluded that reliance was not 

placed upon it before Gray J.  Further, opinions -  they can be 

nothing  more  than that  -  as  to  the  degree  of  that  risk may 

vary  between  judges.  The  transcript  of  the  hearing  before 

Gray  J.  suggests  that  his  Honour  did  not  rate  the  risk  as 

grave.  We must not treat a difference between our perception 

of  the  degree  of  risk  and 

his  Honour's  perception  as 

establishing error of law on his part.  As to the latter risk, 

the  undertakings  required  by  Gray  J.  have  annihilated  it. 

Evaluation of  the degree of  rlsk that the evidence, although 

unlawfully  obtained, might  be  admitted  at trial is not easy. 

It may be considered very unlikely that the evidence would be 

admitted  in those circumstances.  On  the other  hand,  if  the 

evidence were  admitted, the  object  sought  to  be  achieved  by
--------
18. 

the  applicant  in  this  proceeding  would  ultimately  be  wholly 

frustrated. 

At least one ground of the attack on the validity of 

the  Magistrates'  Court  order  involves  no  attack  on  the 

constitutional validity of any statute, and that ground raises 

a  'serious  questlon  to  be  tried. 

Accordingly  the 

considerations  to  which  reference  is  made  in  Castlemaine 

Toohevs Ltd.  v .   South Australia  (1986) 161 C.L.R.  148 are not 

of very great significance in this case. 

Gray J. knew that the committal hearing was fixed to 

commence on  11 April  1994.  But  he was  unable on 28  January 

1994, when his  order was made, to ascertain when the hearing 

of the proceeding was likely to commence, despite his attempts 

to  get  that  information. 

In  the  circumstances  which  the 

evidence before Gray J.  disclosed  it was  arguable that there 

existed no consideration of sufficient gravity to outweigh the 

circumstance that  denial of  a  stay  at  the  time his  Honour's 

order was made would preclude the attainment by Mr. Grollo of 

a principal objective sought to be attained by his institution 

and  prosecution of  the  proceedlng  in  this Court, namely  the 

withholding  from the  respondents  (other than the Magistrate) 

and  their  agents  of  hls  fingerprints. 

The  taking  of  the 

fingerprints and the comparison of those fingerprints with any 

fingerprints on documents held by  the respondents  (other than 

the Magistrate) and the preparation for giving evidence of the 

result  of  the  comparisons would  occupy  no  more  than  a  few
--------
19. 

days.  Until  the  informant's  case  on  the  committal  hearing 

approaches  a  conclus~on no  frustration  of  the  investigative 

process  can  be  caused, nor  any  delaying  or  fragmentation of 

the  committal  hearing. 

It  might  be  said  that,  after  the 

committal  hearing  has  proceeded  for  several  weeks,  its 

duration being  estimated  to  be  about  six weeks, the  parties 

wl&l-be well  placed  to  prophesy  the  likely  decision  in  the 

event  that  no  evidence  derived  from  fingerprints  furnished 

under  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order  is  adduced,  and  well 

placed  to  evaluate  the  real  importance,  in  the  particular 

circumstances  of  these  prosecutions,  of  having  presented  at 

the committal hearing the whole of the evidence whlch might be 

available  to  the  Crown  on any  trial.  (Both sides  professed 

before  Gray  J. and  before  thls  Court  a  strong  sense of  the 

importance  of  achieving  that  completeness  of  evidence.  One 

may unreservedly accept the general principles underlying that 

objective, and may concede the imperative need to achieve the 

objective in many particular cases, without being able at this 

stage to see clearly the need in the particular circumstances 

of  this  case.)  One  must  bear  in mind  that  Gray  J.  had  no 

reason  to  expect  that  judgment  In  these  proceedings  would 

precede  the  time  at  whlch  the  informant's  case  at  the 

committal hearing would approach its closure.  But he did not 

know that judgment in these proceedings would not precede that 

time.  It may be said that by maintaining the stay until near 

that  time  his  Honour would  have  increased  the  risk  that  the 

completion of  the committal hearing  -  and  in consequence the 

commencement  of  any  trlal  -  would  be  delayed,  because  an
--------
20. 

appeal from a single judge's  declsion could be expected and a 

stay  of  the Magistrates'  Court's  order  for  the  provision  of 

Mr.  Grollo's  fingerprints could be  expected  until  the appeal 

had  been  determined. 

That  was  a  consideration  which  his 

Honour was entitled to weigh against continuing the stay until 

further  order  in  the  hope  that  future  events  would  provide 

bet& 

guidance  to  the  Court  in  the  exercise  of  its 

discretion. 

His  Honour  could  not  be  certain  that  the 

undertakings given to him would be  offered  at a  later stage. 

The undertakings may be thought to have been of  great benefit 

to  Mr.  Grollo. 

All  the  considerations  canvassed  in  thls 

paragraph were for h ~ s  Honour to evaluate.  We do not consider 

that it can be concluded that he failed to do so. 

We  have  not  found  error  in  his  Honour's  decision, 

nor  that  such  a  substant~al injustice  to  Mr.  Grollo  would 

result,  in the  event  that  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order be 

set aside, that leave to appeal should be granted. 

The  application by  Mr.  Howard  for  leave  to  appeal 

from the order made by Gray J.  on h ~ s  motion was supported by 

submissions slmilar to those advanced on behalf of Mr. Grollo. 

It might have been urged on Mr. Howard's  behalf before Gray J. 

that publicity durlny the committal hearing about evidence of 

his  fingerprints on documents  in circumstances alleged  to be 

incriminatory was likely to cause hlm greater prejudice in the 

minds  of  members  of  a  jury  at  a  trial  than  publicity  about 

similar  evidence  in  respect  of  Mr.  Grollo  would  cause  Mr.
--------
21. 

Grollo.  There will be  no  fingerprint evidence in respect of 

Mr.  Howard  during  the  committal  hearing  unless  the 

Magistrates'  Court's  order  is  carried  into  effect.  But  the 
submission by  Mr.  Merkel  to  Gray  J.  that  ""publicity ... was 
not part of our submlsslon"" was thereafter adopted by counsel 

for Mr. Haward. 

4 

For  the  reasons  stated  in  relation  to  the 

applicat~on on behalf of Mr. Grollo we refuse Mr. Howard leave 

to appeal also. 

A  motion  by  each  applicant  for  a  stay  of  the 

Maglstrates'  Court's  order has been recently made to a single 

judge of this Court.  The motions were grounded on a change of 

circumstances  since the time when  Gray  J. made  the  order  in 

respect  of  which  leave  to  appeal  has  been  sought.  On  11 

February  the  proceedings were  fixed  for  hearing  on  21  March 

1994, a date later changed to 22 March  1994.  It is therefore 

now  to  be  expected  that  the  hearing  of  the  proceeding  will 

conclude  several  weeks  before  the  committal  hearing  will 

commence, whereas Gray J. had no knowledge when the hearing of 

the proceedings would commence. 

The  motions  were  referred  by  the  single  judge  to 

this Court and application was made to the Chief Justice that 

he  direct,  in  exercise  of  the  power  conferred  on  him  by 

s.20(1A)  of the Federal  Court  of Australia  Act  1976, that the 

jurisdiction of  the Court  in the matter  of  those motions  be
--------
22. 

exercised  by  a  Full  Court,  so  that  jurisdiction  could  be 

exercised  in  those matters  by  this  Court  as  constituted  for 

the  hearing  of  the  application  for  leave  to  appeal.  This 

Court  heard  the  parties'  submissions  for  and  against  the 

motions,  on  the  same  day  as  it  heard  the  applications  for 

leave to appeal.  Subsequently the Acting Chief Justice gave a 

dinection that the jurisdiction of the Court in the matters of 

the  motions  shall  be  exercised  by  a  Full  Court. 

That 

jurisdiction now being available, this Court will exercise it. 

It was  submitted, correctly, that, as each order of 

Gray  J.  was  interlocutory, lt  could  be  varied  or  set  aside. 

But  it would be  an erroneous exercise of that jurisdiction to 

vary  or  set  aside  the  order  where  the  new  circumstance 

suggested is the occurrence of  events which are not  shown to 

have been outside the contemplation of the judge who made the 

order.  Gray J. indicated during argument his belief that the 

proceedings were unllkely to be tried in February.  But there 

is nothing to suggest that he believed that the trials of the 

proceedings  would  not  conclude  before  the  committal  hearing 
had  commenced . 
judgment to the possibility  of  delay or  fragmentation of  the 

His  Honour's  reference  in  his  reasons  for 

committal hearing was made, we consider, in contemplation not 

only  of  the  time  of  completion  of  the  hearing  of  the 

proceedings, but also in contemplation of the time of judgment 

and the time of judgment by a Full Court of this Court and by 

a Full'Court  of the High Court if appeals to those Courts were 

undertaken. 

That  is  why  his  Honour  referred  also  to  the
--------
possibility of delay of a trial on indictment, we consider.

We  would  refuse  the  motions  for  variation  of  the 

orders made by Gray J.

being the decision that the applicant had rendered excessive services 

within the meaning of subsection 79(1B)  of the Health Insurance Act 

1973 and the decision of the second respondent, being the members 

constituting the First Medical  Services Committee of  Inquiry, to 

recommend to the Minister for Health that the applicant had rendered 

excessive services which decision was made on or about 10 May 1993. 

Following those decisions, pursuant to the provisions of the Health 

Insurance Act the matter came before the third respondent, the Third 

Medical Services Review Tribunal.  The Review Tribunal has not given 

its decision.  The applicant seeks to review the conduct of that 

Tribunal.  The application defines the conduct as follows: 

""The Conduct of the third Respondent made on or about 9 November 
1993 whereby the third Respondent refused to consider material 
which was  originally  filed  in the  Federal Court as part  of 
proceedings involving both the first and second Respondents and 
decided such material would not be considered in the conduct of 
its review. "" 

It is not necessary to go through the statutory provisions by 

which these various bodies are set up, their functions and powers. 

It is sufficient to say that the hearing before the Review Tribunal 

commenced on  9 November  1993, continued on  10 November  1993 and 

concluded on 17 December 1993.  There was, as I understand it, an 

application by Dr Edelsten that the hearing by that Tribunal should 

be  adjourned  because  of  potential  proceedings  which  might  be 

commenced in the Federal Court of Australia but the Review Tribunal 

refused to accede to that request.  Apparently, the Review Tribunal 

did  make  some  suggestion  that  it  would  not  proceed  with  the 

consideration of its deliberations as to the outcome of the review 

or to announce its decision until after the completion of the Federal
--------
3 

Court proceedings which might be commenced relating to this matter. 

By way of aside, that view may well have been too wide.  As indicated 

during  the  course  of  argument,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the 

decision of the Review Tribunal could have any effect whatsoever, 

particularly in light of subsequent events if it had made errors of 

law. 

The application to this Court for judicial review was filed on 

26 November 1993, that is, during the period of the adjournment of 

the  proceedings  before  the  Review  Tribunal  but  before  it  had 

completed its hearing.  By  the application, Dr Edelsten sought a 

number of orders by way of motion, including an order that he have 

leave to commence the application in the Federal Court outside the 

time  specified  in  the  Judicial  Review  Act. 

He  sought  also 

interlocutory orders restraining the Review Tribunal from continuing 

its review.  On 16 December 1993 the Court, constituted by Heerey J, 

gave leave to commence proceedings out of time but refused to make 

the interlocutory orders sought.  In those circumstances, the Review 

Tribunal was quite entitled to proceed with the hearing, as it did, 

on 17 December 1993.  I can see no reason why it cannot, at this 

stage, continue its deliberations as to what it should do and to make 

public any decision it arrived at as a result of those deliberations. 

At the time the matter was argued before Heerey J, reference was 

made  to paragraph  10(2)(b)(ii)  of  the Judicial Review Act.  That 

paragraph  provides  in  substance  that  notwithstanding  subsection 

10(1),  which can be ignored for present purposes, the Court may, in 

its discretion, refuse to grant an application under sections 5, 6 

or 7 of the Judicial Review Act that is made to the Court in respect
--------
of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of 

making a decision, or in respect of a failure to make a decision for 

4 

the reason: 

"" (ii) 

that adequate provision is made by any law other than 
this Act  under which  the  applicant is entitled to 
seek a review by the Court, by another court, or by 
another  tribunal,  authority  or  person,  of  that 
decision, conduct or failure."" 

Arising from discussions on the submissions made on behalf of 

the respondents, it appears that the motion is brought pursuant to 

054 r7 of the Federal Court Rules.  In this regard, rules 6 and 7 of 

that Order are of importance.  Rule 6 provides: 

""6.  In applying Order  20, rule 2 to applications under the 
Administrative Decisions lJudicia1 Review) Act 1977, that rule 
shall be  construed as  if  paragraph  l(a)  read  ""no reasonable 
basis for the application is disclosed"". 

Rule 7 provides: 

""7.  Any party who seeks to have an application for an order of 
review dismissed: 

(a)  on a grsund set out in Order 20 Rule 2; 

(b)  on  a  ground  set  out  in  section  10  of  the 
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977; 
or 

(c)  in the exercise of the Court's discretion; 

shall apply promptly for such dismissal."" 

On one view, the discretion to refuse to make an order conferred 

by paragraph 10(2)(b)(ii)  of the Judicial Review Act is a discretion 

which  should be  exercised  at  the  conclusion of  a  hearing  of  an
--------
application for judicial review.  The power goes to a discretionary 

matter  and  would  apply  in  circumstances  where  an  applicant  had 

established grounds for the making of the order sought, but despite 

that, the Court has discretion to refuse to make  an order in the 

circumstances specified in that paragraph.  There are authorities to 

the effect that for practical reasons it is desirable that where a 

respondent is proposing  to  raise this  discretionary matter,  that 

respondent can do so at an early stage by way of motion for an order 

of the type referred to in 054 r7(b).  Having regard to the context 

in which this power to dismiss is contained, and having regard to the 

well established legal principles that in applications under 020 r2 

to have an application dismissed on the ground that no reasonable 

cause of action is disclosed that the courts have adopted (see, for 

example, General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railwavs 
m (1964) 112 CLR 125 per Barwick CJ at pp 128-9) that all facts 
in support of the claim being made must be assumed in favour of the 

applicant and against the respondent seeking to have the application 

dismissed or stayed, the  same principles  should be  applied here. 

This  is only  logical.  It sits neatly with  the concept that the 

exercise of a power of the kind referred to in paragraph lO(2) (b) (ii) 

of the Judicial Review Act is a power having the same character. 

Applying those principles, for the purposes of the hearing of 

the motion, it must be assumed that the applicant, in this case Dr 

Edelsten, would  succeed  in his  claim.  Even  so,  for  the  reason 

specified  in  that  section,  the  Court  could  only  come  to  one 

conclusion and refuse to make an order on the ground specified in 

that section.  In these circumstances, it seems to me that there is 

nothing in the submission that the motion is an abuse of the process
--------
6 

of the Court.  The purpose of the motion overcomes a problem, which 

otherwise would arise, of the Court having to consider the whole of 

the applicant's  case to determine whether, on the facts proved, the 

applicant would succeed.  The summary power is designed to avoid that 

very  thing. 

It  allows  a  summary  judgment  to  be  given  in  the 

S 

circumstances where, even if otherwise an applicant would succeed, 

no order would be made in favour of that applicant. 

The problem in the present case, to some extent, arises from the 

fact that the application for review seeks to review decisions which 

have been made, about which there are no problems, but also seeks 

review of  conduct of  the  Review Tribunal.  The conduct which  is 

challenged is illustrated by  a reference to pages  8 to 10 of the 

application.  Commencing on page 8 the application sets out why the 

applicant is aggrieved as follows: 

""1.  A  great quantity of  relevant material was  filed  in the 
Federal Court proceedings and was examined by the second 
Respondent. 

2 .  

3 .  

This material was referred to during its Inquiry and forms 
part of its decision. 

Notwithstanding that the Applicant has requested that this 
material form part of the review by the third respondent, 
the third respondent has refused to examine this material 
or to take in into consideration in the conduct of  its 
review. "" 

The grounds for the application need not be referred to at the 

present time. 

Although  it  may  be  said  that  this  conduct  extends  to  the 

consideration of the determination and the publication of it by the
--------
7 

Review  Tribunal  and  although  that  is  still  in  the  future,  the 

appli~ation is seeking to review conduct which has already passed. 

In all the circumstances of the case, I see no reason why the Court 

should not proceed with the hearing of the motion by the Minister for 

Health on the basis that it is to be assumed that the claim by the 

applicant would succeed, but even assuming that, this is a case where 

in its discretion the Court would of necessity refuse to grant the 

orders sought, on the ground that adequate provision is made by a law 

under which  the applicant is entitled  to  seek  a  review of  those 

decisions and conduct by another tribunal. 

The Court will continue with the hearing of the motion. 

The  matter  before  the  Court  is,  in  reality,  the  proper 

construction  and  application  of  paragraph  10(2)(b)(ii)  of  the 

Judicial Review Act.  Reduced to its bare minimum, the Court can only 

exercise its discretion in favour of the respondent in this case if 

there is adequate provision made by any law, other than the Judicial 

Review Act, under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review 

by another tribunal of the decisions or content specified. 

In this regard Mr Hutner, on behalf  of  the respondents, has 

referred the Court to the scheme under the Health Insurance Act by 

which there exists procedures  for the review of the decisions or 

conduct of the Minister for Health, the Committee of Inquiry and the 

Review Tribunal respectively.  Under s106 of  the Health Insurance 
m,  the  Minister  has  power  to  make  a  determination  on  a 
recommendation of a committee constituted under the Health Insurance 

in  relation  to  matters  of  over-servicing  by  medical
--------
practitioners.  There is a provision in that Act for review of that 

determination by the Minister.  This is contained in Part VA of the 

Health Insurance Act.  Paragraph 107A(l)(a)  is as follows: 

"" 107A 
( 1 )   Subject to this Part, where the Minister makes 
a determination, the person to whom the determination relates 
may: 

(a)  if  the  determination  is  a  determination  other  than  a 
determination referred to in paragraph  (b), request the 
Minister  in  accordance  with  Division  3  to  refer  the 
determination to a Medical Services Review Tribunal for 
review; or 

(b)  ... "" 

The  Act  contains  a  number  of  provisions  setting  up  Review 

Tribunals.  Under s114, provision is made for a request for review 

by a person to whom a determination relates, and for how the request 

is to be made.  The request is made in writing and must set out the 

grounds on which the request is made and it is to be served on the 

Minister  within  a  specified  time. 

The  Act  contains  detailed 

provisions  as  to what  follows thereafter including the rights of 

parties at the proceedings under review.  Section 118 deals with the 

procedure  before  the  Tribunal. 

Section  119  deals  with  the 

proceedings on review.  It is a long section as follows: 

""119  ( 1 )   Atribunal that reviews a determination in accordance 
with a request: 

(a)  shall  consider  the  matter  to  which  the  determination 
relates  having  regard  to  the  grounds  set  out  in  the 
request, the documents forwarded by the Minister with the 
request and any addresses made to the Tribunal during the 
proceedings on the review; and 

(b)  shall, subject to subsection (2): 

(i) 

in the case of  a determination that consists of  a 
refusal by the Minister, under subsection 23B(2),  to
--------
(ii) 

(iii) 

accept  an  undertaking  -  affirm  or  set  aside  the 
determination; 

in the case of a determination made under section 106 
in accordance with  a recommendation referred to in 
paragraph 105(2)(e)  or (f) or 105(2A)(f)  or ( g )  or a 
determination made under section 106FK in accordance 
with  a  recommendation  referred  to  in  paragraph 
106FJ(2)(f)  or (g), 106FJ(3)(f)  or (g) or 106FJ(4)(d) 
or (e) -  affirm, set aside or vary the determination; 

in the case of any other determination under section 
106 or 106FK - affirm or set aside the determination, 
or  set aside the  determination and make  any other 
determination that the Minister is empowered to make 
under  that  section  in  giving  effect  to  any 
recommendation of a Committee. 

(2)  The decision of  a  Tribunal on a  review shall, for  all 
purposes  (except for the purposes of this Part), be deemed to 
be a determination of the Minister."" 

Having regard to the whole of the relevant provisions of the 

Health Insurance Act, it appears that a Review Tribunal has a power 

to review the decision of the Minister based upon the material that 

was  before  the  Minister,  being  the  report  of  the  Committee  of 

Inquiry, and all matters that were before the Committee.  It appears 

that no further evidence can be given to the Review Tribunal, but it 

exercises  its  discretion on  all  the matters  properly  before  the 

Committee and the Minister, and thus before it.  If in fact it takes 

into account extraneous matters, that may well  be  a basis  for a 

challenge to the decision of the Review Tribunal.  If it fails to 

take into account relevant matters, that may well be  a basis  for 

Review of the decision of the Review Tribunal. 

Section 124A of the Health Insurance Act provides: 

"" 124A 
A  party  to  a  proceeding  before  a  Tribunal  under 
Division 3 may appeal, on a question of law only, to the Federal 
Court of Australia from any decision of the Tribunal in that
--------
proceeding."" 

1n'the circumstances and on the assumption made in favour of the 

applicant as illustrated earlier in these reasons, it is necessary 

for me 'to  determine whether  those provision6  constitute adequate 

provisions made by law, in this case the Health Insurance Act, under 

which the applicant, Dr Edelsten, is entitled to seek a review by 

this  Court or another tribunal of  the  decisions which  are being 

reviewed by the Review Tribunal or the conduct of that Tribunal.  In 

doing  this,  the  first crucial words  are  ""adequate provision""  in 

paragraph  10(2)(b)(ii)  of  the  Judicial  Review  Act. 

The  word 

""adequate"" is a word in everyday use.  It has well defined meanings 

and essentially means sufficient or suitable.  That is given in the 

Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.  Fully sufficient or suitable are 

the meanings given in the Macquarie Dictionary.  In this context, the 

adequate provision is to be read as adequate in the sense of suitable 

or sufficient provision for review. 

In my opinion, the provisions of the Health Insurance Act do 

make  adequate  provision,  in  that  sense,  for  the  review  of  the 

decision made by the Minister and of the Committee of Inquiry by the 

Review Tribunal.  If the Review Tribunal makes any error of law, the 

decision can be reviewed by this Court on an appeal under s124A of 

the Health  Insurance Act.  A very detailed set of provisions  are 

applicable to the procedures of the Review Tribunal, a very detailed 

procedure is provided for the setting up of the Review Tribunal, and 

its powers and functions.  In those circumstances, this is a case 

where,  in  the  exercise  of  a  discretion,  even  if  the  applicant 

otherwise was entitled to review under the Judicial Review Act, the
--------
11 

Court should exercise discretion under paragraph lO(b)(2)(ii)  of the 

Judicial Review Act.  In my opinion, this is the only conclusion 

which the Court could come to in the circumstances of this case. 

Dr. Edelsten  did  argue  that  there  were  special  features 

applicable  which  should  be  taken  into  account  to  deny  that 

conclusion.  For instance, the serious nature of the consequences of 

a determination by the Review Committee, the effect on the medical 

practitioner concerned, the fact that the Review Committee is not 

able to consider questions of law, such as whether there was a denial 

of natural justice in the earlier proceeding before the Minister or 

the Committee of Inquiry, and the limited nature of the review.  But 

it is difficult to see how that can have any real meaning when the 

Review Tribunal is in essence and in fact exercising the powers of 

the Minister on material that was properly before the Minister. 

As  I said before, if the Tribunal goes wrong in any of those 

areas, there is an appeal to this Court.  It is also argued that a 

course of this kind would result in additional costs, but I reject 

that argument because it would be completely unrealistic to enable 

this existing judicial review application to proceed at a time when 

it may well be that the Review Tribunal will come to a decision which 

is unreviewable and completely binding on the parties.  If errors do 

occur, Dr Edelsten can appeal, on a question of law, to this Court. 

In these circumstances, the motion is granted.  It is ordered 

that the application for order to review herein be dismissed with 

costs.

                   The appellant was
tried by a judge and jury on a charge of second degree murder.  In his charge
to the jury, the trial judge described three possible grounds upon which the
appellant could be found guilty.  First, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty of aiding and abetting an intentional killing
by the combined operation of ss. 21(1)  and 212 (a) of the Criminal
Code .  Secondly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found
guilty as a party to a murder by the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and
213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  Thirdly, the jury was instructed
that the appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined
operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c) of the Criminal Code .  The
trial judge clearly stated that the appellant could be found guilty of murder
whether or not he knew or ought to have known that the victim's death would
result in the circumstances.  The charge was given before the Supreme Court's
decisions in R. v. Vaillancourt, R. v. Martineau, and R. v.
Logan, and was appropriate at the time.

 

                   The jury found the
appellant guilty on the charge of second degree murder and this verdict was
upheld on appeal.  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge's
instructions to the jury were inconsistent with R. v. Vaillancourt since
they allowed the appellant to be convicted on the combined application of
ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c) as a party to murder even if he did not have objective
foresight of the death of the victim.  The majority of the Court of Appeal,
however, invoked the curative provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
(formerly 613(1)(b)(iii)) of the Criminal Code  in order to uphold
the appellant's conviction.

 

                   The appellant
appealed as of right on the question whether his conviction was properly
sustained through the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) and with
leave at large.  The appellant submitted that s. 213 (c) was
inconsistent, both alone and in combination with s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code , with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  He also
submitted that this restriction could not be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed. 
Section 213 (c) of the Criminal Code  contravenes ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter  and is not justified under s. 1 .  Section 21(2) 
contravenes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  with respect to
offences for which subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement in so
far as it permits a party to be convicted on the basis that he or she ""ought
to have known"" that the commission of the offence would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose.  This restriction of ss. 7  and
11 (d) is not justified under s. 1 .

 

                   In R. v.
Martineau, it was necessary for the Court to determine the minimum degree
of mens rea required by the Charter  for the offence of murder in
order to assess the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code .  The determination of this minimum degree of mens rea was
therefore the live issue before this Court.  Consequently, the finding in Martineau
that proof of subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a
conviction for murder and that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code 
violated the Charter  since it did not embrace this requirement was the ratio
decidendi and not obiter dictum.  Similarly, since the principles of
fundamental justice constitutionally require proof of subjective foresight of
death in order to sustain a conviction of a principal for murder, that same
degree of mens rea is constitutionally required to sustain the
conviction of a party to the offence of murder:  R. v. Logan.

 

                   Section 213 (c)
of the Criminal Code , as worded, violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter  and is, therefore, of no force or effect.  An accused may be
convicted of murder under s. 213 (c) without proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that he had subjective foresight of the death of his victim.

 

                   The appellant's
conviction should not be sustained through the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal
involves a constitutional challenge, under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to s. 213(c) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 230 (c)).  The appellant challenges the
constitutional validity of s. 213(c) both alone and in combination with
s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The appellant was
tried by a judge and jury on a charge of second degree murder.  In his charge
to the jury, the trial judge described three possible grounds upon which the
appellant could be found guilty.  First, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty of aiding and abetting an intentional killing
by the combined operation of ss. 21(1)  and 212 (a) (now 229(a)) of
the Criminal Code . Secondly, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined
operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (a) (now 230(a)) of the
Criminal Code ). 
Thirdly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found guilty as a
party to a murder by the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c) of
the Criminal Code .  The trial judge clearly stated that the
appellant could be found guilty of murder whether or not he knew or ought to
have known that the victim's death would result in the circumstances.

 

                   The jury found the
appellant guilty on the charge of second degree murder.  This verdict was
upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal: (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 45, 31 O.A.C.
21.  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the appellant could be convicted on the combined
application of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c).  The trial judge informed the jury
that, by the operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c), the appellant could be
convicted as a party to murder even if he did not have objective foresight
of the death of the victim.  The Court of Appeal found, therefore, that the
instructions were not consistent with the judgment of this Court in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  (It should be noted that the Court of
Appeal's judgment in this case was rendered prior to the judgment of this Court
in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.)  The majority of the Court of
Appeal, however, invoked the curative provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 613(1) (b)(iii)),
in order to uphold the appellant's conviction.  In dissenting reasons, Cory
J.A. (as he then was) disagreed with the majority on this point.

 

                   The appellant now
appeals to this Court as of right on the question whether his conviction was
properly sustained through the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) and with
leave at large.  He requests a new trial on the grounds that the trial judge
erred in instructing the jury that the combined application of ss. 21(2)  and
213 (a) or ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c) could provide the bases for a
conviction for second degree murder.  He argues that a conviction for murder
will not lie in the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused
had subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim.  An accused, in his
opinion, may only be convicted of murder if the trier of fact is satisfied that
the accused intended to cause the death of an individual or knew that the death
of that individual would be the likely result of his conduct.  Similarly, he
submits that an accused may only be convicted as a party to murder upon proof that
he or she had subjective foresight of the death of the victim. The appellant
also submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in applying the
curative provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) in this case. 

 

                   The appellant
relies on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, supra.  Martineau
involved a challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the
Criminal Code .  A
majority of the Court (Dickson C.J., Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory
JJ.) held that s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  requires proof that an accused had
subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim before a conviction for
murder can be sustained. Under s. 213(a), however, an accused could be
convicted of murder whether or not he intended to kill his victim or knew that
death was a likely result of his conduct.  The provision thus violated ss. 7 
and 11 (d) of the Charter  and was declared to be of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)  of
the Constitution Act, 1982 .

 

                   The respondent
argued before this Court that the finding of the majority in
Martineau that
subjective foreseeability of death is the minimum constitutional mens rea
requirement for murder is obiter dictum.  The respondent emphasized that, under s. 213(a)
of the Code, an accused could be convicted of murder in the absence of proof that
he had objective foresight of the death of his victim.  Section 213(a),
therefore, could have been found to violate ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the
Charter  on the basis
that the provision did not require objective foresight of death as an essential
element of the offence.  In this light, our findings regarding subjective
foresight of death were arguably unnecessary to the resolution of the case.

 

                   In my opinion, a
correct reading of Martineau does not support the respondent's submission.  In Martineau, as
I noted above, this Court was asked to pronounce on the constitutional validity
of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  To answer this question, it
was necessary to determine the minimum degree of mens rea required by
the Charter  for the offence of murder.  The determination of this
minimum constitutional mens rea requirement was therefore the live issue
before this Court. Consequently, our finding in Martineau, that proof of
subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a conviction for
murder and that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  violated the Charter 
since it did not embrace this requirement, was not obiter dictum.  This
finding was the ratio decidendi of the decision.

 

                   Similarly, it was
held by this Court in R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731, that when the
principles of fundamental justice constitutionally require, under s. 7  of the Charter ,
that there be a minimum degree of mens rea for conviction of a
particular offence to be sustained, the same minimum degree of mens rea
is constitutionally required for an accused to be convicted under s. 21(2)  as a
party to that offence.  Since the principles of fundamental justice
constitutionally require proof of subjective foresight of death in order to
sustain a conviction of a principal for murder, that same degree of mens rea
is constitutionally required to sustain the conviction of a party to the
offence of murder.

 

                   An accused may be
convicted of murder under s. 213(c) without proof beyond a reasonable
doubt that he had subjective foresight of the death of his victim. 
Accordingly, s. 213(c), as worded, infringes the rights guaranteed by
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  The provision cannot be saved by
s. 1  of the Charter :  see Martineau, supra, at p. 647, and
Logan, supra, at pp. 745-47.  Section 213 (c) is therefore
of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 . 
The trial judge's charge to the jury was incorrect in law since the jury was
instructed that the appellant could be convicted as a party to murder, on the
combined application of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (a) or ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c),
in the absence of proof that the appellant had subjective foresight of the
death of the victim.  I note, however, that his charge to the jury was entirely
appropriate at the time since it was rendered prior to the decisions of this
Court in Vaillancourt, Martineau and Logan, supra.

 

                   I agree with the
dissenting reasons of Cory J.A. in the Court of Appeal that the appellant's
conviction should not be sustained through the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Consequently, I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial.  I would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 213(c) of the Criminal Code  [now s. 230 (c)] contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Yes.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 213 (c) of the
Criminal Code  [now s.
230 (c)] justified under s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

No.

 

3.Does
s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

Yes,
s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  contravenes the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  with respect to
offences for which subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement in so
far as it permits a party to be convicted on the basis that he or she
""ought to have known"" that the commission of the offence would be a
probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.

 

4.If
the answer to question 3 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the
Criminal Code 
justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

No.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Conspiracy to traffic in drugs—Sentence of 12 years—New Criminal Code
coming into force during period of offence—Leave to appeal from sentence
sought—Whether jurisdiction to entertain appeal—Criminal Code,

[Page 61]

1953-54(Can.), c. 51, ss. 408(1)(d), 597(1)(b)—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, ss. 573, 1023—The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
259, s. 41.

The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in drugs
and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the
new Criminal Code, which came into force during the period of time
within which the offence was committed. His appeal against the conviction was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to this Court from that
judgment was refused. His subsequent appeal against the sentence was also
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and from that judgment he applied to this
Court for leave to appeal against the sentence on the question of law as to
whether s. 408(1)(d) was applicable, since, if it was not, the maximum
sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in the former Code, as found
in s. 573, was 7 years. The Crown submitted that this Court was without
jurisdiction to grant leave. The appellant alleged an alteration of the prior
state of the law.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): This Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission
of an indictable offence.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The
question whether this Court had any jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal
has always been negatively answered prior to the coming into force of the new
Code. Goldhamer v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290 and Parthenais v. The
King (1945) (unreported). An intent of Parliament to depart from this state
of the law could not be found either under the provisions of the new Code or
under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

As to the new Code. It is clear that no change has been made
as to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in
indictable offences. The distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure and lead to two distinct judgments. As to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the true meaning of the expression
""whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" in s. 597(1)(b)
must be ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an
appeal to the Court of Appeal. On these provisions, the ""conviction""
which the latter Court may affirm is a conviction within the narrow meaning of Goldhamer
v. The King. ""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in s.
597(1)(b), is the judgment against which an appeal is given under
s. 597(1); and, as nowhere but in the opening words of the section is an appeal
given, that judgment must be a judgment capable of coming within the language
of the opening words. Although the words ""in affirmance of the
conviction"", which were in s. 1024 of the former Code, do not appear in s.
597(1), they are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. No significance
could be attached to the fact that s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large
while under s. 597 the appeal is restricted to pure questions of law. Because
it may be said in certain cases that an applicant comes within the description
of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words of s. 597,
it does not follow that his application does so or in other words, that the
right given is a right to appeal against a conviction in the wider sense.

[Page 62]

As to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The
inconsistencies flowing from the interpretations put by the appellant on s. 41,
clearly indicate that it was never intended by Parliament that the right of
appeal given under this section would extend to indictable offences, as
distinguished from non indictable offences. This is supported by the fact that,
under the Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences
are dealt with in the appellate provisions related to appeal to this Court
under the Code. It is further supported by the clear contradiction which would
exist between the special appellate provisions under the Code and the general
appellate provisions under s. 41.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The
application falls within the literal meaning of the words in s. 597; and the
terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do not appear to require the Court to construe s.
597 in the limited sense contended for by the respondent. The case of Goldhamer
v. The King was distinguishable. One of the primary purposes of Parliament
in enacting s. 597 in its present form would be pro tanto thwarted if it
were held that this Court was without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of
law as to whether a sentence imposed was or was not authorized by statute. No
sufficient reason has been advanced for interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a
jurisdiction which appears to be conferred by the words of that section
construed in their ordinary and literal meaning.

Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.
Reading s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act together
and as explanatory of each other, as should be done since they are in pari
materia, the word ""conviction"" in both sections should be read
""with a signification including the sentence"", giving thereby effect
to the apparent intention of Parliament that the jurisdiction of this Court in
criminal matters should be strictly limited to points of law and yet wide
enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation of the criminal law
throughout the country.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a sentence. Application refused,
Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., for the appellant.

J. D. Hilton, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—This
is a motion for leave to appeal to this Court against a sentence, imposed by
the trial judge and subsequently confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, on a conviction for an indictable offence.

Goldhar was indicted for having, in the city of Toronto and
elsewhere in the province of Ontario, between the 15th of March and the 6th of
August, 1955, conspired with

[Page 63]

others to commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug for the purposes of trafficking. On this charge, he was found
guilty by a jury, on the 4th of May, 1956, and thereupon sentenced to twelve
years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, 2-3 Elizabeth II, hereafter referred to as the new Code.

During the period of time, within which the offence charged
was committed, i.e. on the first day of April 1955, the new Code came into
force; and this fact gives rise to the question of law on which leave to appeal
is now sought. As formulated, on behalf of the applicant, the question is
whether s. 408(1)(d) of the new Code is applicable to the
conspiracy committed, since, if it is not, the maximum sentence for a
conspiracy not specifically named in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c.
36, is found under s. 573 of the said Statute, namely seven (7) years.

The point of law raised is undoubtedly one of substance and
may possibly, depending particularly of the evidence in the record, affect the
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal, if leave is granted. However, the
primary and major question to be considered and determined is whether this
Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed
for the commission of an indictable offence.

That such a question has always been negatively answered,
prior to the coming into force of the new Code, is not open to question.

In Goldhamer v. His Majesty the King1, the appellant, having
been found guilty of a criminal offence, was sentenced to pay a fine of four
hundred dollars or to be imprisoned during three months in default of payment.
After the fine had been paid, the Attorney-General appealed against the
sentence, under s. 1013 Cr. C; and by a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal,
in addition to the fine, condemned the appellant to be imprisoned for a period
of six months. On a further appeal to this Court, it was decided that there was
no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal in the
matter of

[Page 64]

sentence, the right of appeal being restricted to an appeal
against the affirmance of a conviction. At the time of the decision of this
Court, the relevant part of s. 1024, under which the appeal purported to be
based, read as follows:

1024.—Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of
Appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in
writing has been served on the Attorney-General within fifteen days after such
affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of
Canada or a judge thereof.

It is pointed out, in the reasons for judgment of this
Court, that the word ""conviction"" in s. 1024 cannot perhaps be said
to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, but can be capable of
being employed with the signification including the sentence. The majority,
however, felt compelled to ascribe to the word the less technical sense which
excludes the sentence as distinguished from the conviction. The sole reason for
this interpretation and the decision consequential thereto is exclusively
founded on the clear distinction made in s. 1013, for the purposes of appeal in
indictable matters, between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal
against a sentence. The appellant in that case did not question the
appropriateness of the measure of the sentence but challenged, as a matter of
law, the right of the provincial Court of Appeal to interfere with a sentence
which had already been satisfied when the appeal to that Court was taken by the
Attorney-General. The nature of the ground, however, is entirely foreign to the
ratio decidendi. It is the right of appeal itself which was found not to
have been given by Parliament, in the matter of sentence.

Some twenty years after this decision, again the question
arose in the case of Parthenais v. The King2. Parthenais had entered an
appeal in this Court against a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal which
had increased the sentence imposed upon him on a plea of guilty to the charge

[Page 65]

of an indictable offence. At that time, the matter was
governed by what was then s. 1023 Cr. C., the relevant part of which read as
follows:

1023. Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal.

The point of law, upon which there was a dissent, was
whether the Attorney-General,—who took a more serious view of the facts of the
case than did the Crown prosecutor, in first instance,—could appeal to the
Court of Appeal against a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty which had been
entered by the accused on the condition that the sentence, pre-agreed between
his counsel and counsel for the Crown, would be passed by the trial judge. The
distinction between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal against a
sentence, which had brought about the decision of this Court in Goldhamer,
supra, was still present in the appellate provisions related to appeals to
the provincial Courts. This Court followed the same course and, on the 2nd of
October, 1945, quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal against a sentence.

Such was the state of the law when the new Code was enacted
in 1954. The question is therefore whether an intent of Parliament to make such
a substantial departure from this state of the law, as would represent the
creation of a new right of appeal to this Court, can be found, as is suggested,
either under the relevant provisions of the new Code or under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act. In approaching the question, one must be mindful that a
legislature is not presumed to make any substantial alteration in the law
beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear
implication. This presumption against the implicit alteration of the law is
not, I think, of lesser moment where the new law, under which the alteration is
claimed, is of a nature such as that of the one here considered, to wit, a
revision of a Code.

The new Code. With respect to the appellate provisions
related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in indictable offences, it is clear
that no change has been made, in that,

[Page 66]

the distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure, and lead to two distinct judgments. With
respect to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada, the section of the new Code, relied on by counsel for the applicant as
a basis for his application and under which the alteration of the prior state
of the law is claimed, is s. 597(1)(b), which reads as follows:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

(a)..............................................................................................................................
………………………………………………………………………………………………

(b) on any question
of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow.

The opening words of that section make it equally clear that
the right of appeal to this Court is given to one who is (i) a person who is
convicted of an indictable offence and (ii) whose conviction is affirmed by the
Court of Appeal. The true meaning of the expression, in (ii), ""whose
conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" must, of necessity, be
ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an appeal to
the Court of Appeal. And again, on these provisions, the
""conviction"", which the latter Court may affirm, is a conviction
within the narrow meaning ascribed by this Court in Goldhamer, supra. If,
contrary to that decision, the word was here given the wider sense which
includes the sentence, it would follow that one ""whose sentence is affirmed
by the Court of Appeal"" would have a right of appeal to this Court,
while one, whose sentence is not affirmed but increased by the Court of Appeal,
would not.

Adverting now to the provisions of (a) and (b)
of s. 597(1). These provisions are related to the right of appeal given under
the opening words. In (a), they restrict the right of appeal to
questions of law. And, in (b), they condition the exercise of the
right to the obtention of a leave and prescribe the delay within which, after
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced"", such leave must be
granted.

[Page 67]

""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in (b),
is the judgment against which an appeal is given under s. 597(1); and, as
nowhere, but in the opening words thereof, is an appeal given, ""the
judgment appealed from"" must be a judgment capable of coming within the
language of the opening words. On this language and for the reasons just
mentioned, such a judgment can only be a judgment in affirmance of a conviction
and not related to the matter of sentence.

Having considered the following points advanced in support
of the application, I must say, with deference, that I am unable to find that
they are valid.

Reference is made and significance is attached to two points
of difference emerging from a comparison of s. 1024, under which Goldhamer was
decided, with s. 597(1) of the new Code. The first is that the words ""in
affirmance of the conviction"", which were in the former section, do not
appear in the latter. In my view and for the reasons just mentioned, these
words are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. The second point is that
s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large while under s. 597, the appeal is
restricted to pure questions of law. The range or nature of the questions
raised in support of an appeal is foreign to the ratio decidendi in Goldhamer.
Furthermore, when the decision in that case was, twenty years later,
followed in Parthenais, the appeal to this Court was then, under the
relevant section, s. 1023, as it is to-day under s. 597(1), restricted to
questions of law.

It is then sought to ascribe to the word
""judgment"" in the phrase ""the judgment appealed from is
pronounced"", the usual meaning given to the word in a law dictionary.
This, I think, one is precluded to do for, in the context of s. 597, and in the
light of the other sections of the Code to which this particular section is
inextricably related, a judgment as to conviction and a judgment as to sentence
are, for the purposes of appeal, two separate judgments, each having a distinct
technical meaning under the Code.

It is also suggested that the applicant having been
convicted of an indictable offence and his conviction having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal,—as, in fact, it was finally, prior to the launching of his
appeal to that Court, against the sentence,—his application falls within the
literal

[Page 68]

meaning of s. 597(1) (b). While, because of these
circumstances, it may be said that the applicant comes within the
description of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words
of the section, it does not follow that the application he makes does
so, or that, in other words, the right given to such a person is a right of
appeal against a conviction in the wider sense, as distinguished from a
conviction in the narrow technical sense given in Goldhamer. The premise
upon which this suggestion is predicated has no relevancy to the nature of the
right of appeal which is given under the section. It may also be added that, if
the interpretation contended for were accepted, in the result, Parliament would
have given a right of appeal against sentence to a person coming within the
language of the opening words of the section but would have refused a similar
right to a person who, having appealed to the Court of Appeal only against his
sentence, and not against his conviction, could never possibly come within that
language; for the Court of Appeal cannot affirm an unappealed conviction.

Finally, it is said that in enacting s. 597, in its present
form, one must find an apparent intention of Parliament to ensure uniformity in
the interpretation of criminal law throughout Canada and that such a purpose
would be, pro tanto, thwarted, if we were to hold that we are without
jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law as to whether a sentence imposed
is or is not authorized by a statute. With respect to sentence, as
distinguished from conviction, I am quite unable, for the reasons above
indicated, to find such an intention of Parliament in s. 597. It also appears
that such an intent is negatived by the other appellate provisions related to
appeals to this Court. Under these appellate provisions, the right of appeal,
given to the Attorney-General, namely in s. 598, does not include the right to
appeal in the matter of sentence. For the implementation of this alleged intent
and purpose of Parliament, it is no less essential that a right, similar to the
one contended for on behalf of the applicant, be given to the Attorney-General;
but it has not been given.

[Page 69]

For these reasons, I am clearly of the view that nowhere in
the relevant provisions of the new Code, did Parliament indicate, either in
express terms or by clear implication, any intent to alter the prior state of
the law, under which there is no appeal to this Court in the matter of
sentence.

Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The relevant
parts of that section read as follows:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during
the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such
further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after
the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

To support applicant's contention that s. 41 confers
jurisdiction to this Court to entertain appeals in matters of sentence, imposed
in respect of indictable offences, the provisions of subsection (3) are assumed
to be subordinated to those of subsection (1)—in that, the latter states the
principle and the former, the exception—; and, on that assumption, the
following interpretation is given.

If matters of sentence are held to come within the language
of subsection (3), then, by force of the latter, they are excepted from the
operation of subsection (1); and, for this reason alone, this Court has no
jurisdiction.

If, on the contrary, matters of sentence are held not to
come within the language of subsection (3), then, not being excepted from the
operation of subsection (1), there is jurisdiction in this Court.

In both alternatives, however, this interpretation leads to
inconsistencies.

In the first alternative, while a judgment affirming a
sentence would be excepted from the operation of subsection (1) by force of
subsection (3), there are no words in the latter capable of excepting a
judgment increasing the

[Page 70]

sentence. And, in the result, this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal when the sentence has been increased, but
would be without jurisdiction when it has been affirmed; and this, even if in
either case the question raised in support of the appeal be whether the
sentence is authorized or not by statute.

In the second alternative where, on the interpretation of
subsection (3), this Court would have jurisdiction in the matter of sentence,
the following inconsistencies would ensue. Contrary to what is the situation
with respect to every authorized appeal to this Court in criminal matters, the
appeal against sentence under s. 41 would not be restricted to pure questions
of law but would extend to questions of mixed law and facts and to pure
questions of fact. In addition, the delay within which leave to appeal must be
granted, being determined by subsection (2), would be, in the matter, far in
excess of the delay prescribed for the proper administration of justice in
criminal matters, for the obtention of leave to appeal to this Court against a
conviction or an acquittal.

I cannot think that Parliament ever intended or even
contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of these
interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

This view is supported by the fact that, under the Criminal
Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences are,
contrary to what is the case with respect to non indictable offences, dealt
with in the appellate provisions related to appeals to this Court under the
Code.

It is further supported by the clear contradiction which
would exist, on the view that Parliament intended to include indictable
offences in s. 41, between the special appellate provisions under the Code and
the general appellate provisions under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

Parliament is presumed to be consistent with itself and the
language of every Act must be construed as far as possible in accordance with
the terms of every other statute

[Page 71]

which it does not in express terms modify in a way avoiding
contradictions. It has been indicated above that, if s. 597 was interpreted as
giving a right of appeal as to sentences, inconsistencies would result and
that, on the contrary interpretation, there would not be any, the state of the
law remaining what it was prior to the enactment of the new Code. And it has
also been pointed out that inconsistencies would flow from the suggested
interpretation of s. 41. In these views, one cannot find, either under the Code
or under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the explicit language required
to indicate an intent of Parliament to alter the prior state of the law as to
appeals to this Court in the matter of sentence imposed in respect of
indictable offences.

With great deference, I find it impossible to reconcile the
two Acts by interpreting the word ""conviction"" in both subsections
41(3) and 597(1) (b) as including sentence in indictable offences, for
each one of the subsections cannot be so interpreted without leading to
inconsistencies.

Under the former Code, appeals against sentence have always
been left to the final determination of the provincial Courts and there is
nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, indicating
a change of policy in the matter, with respect to indictable offences.

This Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the present
application which I would dismiss.

This being a matter of jurisdiction, all the Members of the
Court have been consulted and I am requested by the Court to say that all,
excepting our brother Cartwright, are in agreement with these reasons.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):—This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on May 29, 1959,
dismissing the applicant's appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by His
Honour Judge Macdonell on May 4, 1956. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was
brought pursuant to an order of that Court made on April 29, 1959, extending
the time for applying for leave to appeal and granting leave to appeal against
the sentence mentioned.

[Page 72]

On April 27, 1956, the accused was convicted before His
Honour Judge Macdonell at the sittings of the Court of General Sessions of the
Peace for the County of York on the charge that:

Jacob Rosenblat, Jack Goldhar (the applicant), Leonuell
Joseph Craig and Hannelore Rosenblum, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, between the 15th day of March
and the 6th day of August, in the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together,
the one with the other or others of them and persons unknown, to commit the
indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code.

On May 4, 1956, His Honour Judge Macdonell sentenced the
applicant to twelve years' imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary.

An appeal against this conviction (but not against the
sentence imposed) was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario3 and was dismissed on February 13,
1957; leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment was refused4 on May 1, 1957.

The sentence of twelve years was imposed pursuant to s.
408(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by 2-3
Elizabeth II, c. 51, which came into force on April 1, 1955, and is referred to
in these reasons as ""the new code"". Section 408 reads in part as
follows:

408(1) Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the
following provisions apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

* * *

(d) every one who conspires with any one to
commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to the same
punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of that offence would,
upon conviction, be liable.

The maximum term of imprisonment for the indictable offence
of having possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking is fourteen
years, as provided by s. 4(3) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which
section came into force on June 10, 1954.

Under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36,
hereinafter referred to as ""the old code"", the maximum term of
imprisonment which could have been imposed upon the

[Page 73]

applicant for the offence of which he was convicted would
have been seven years, as provided by s. 573 of the old Code which reads as
follows:

573. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

The question of law on which leave to appeal to this Court
is sought is stated in the notice of motion as follows:

Whether Section 408(1)(d) of The Criminal Code
1953-1954, Ch. 51 is applicable to the conspiracy committed, since if it is not
the maximum sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in The Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, Ch. 36, is found under Section 573 of the said Statute,
namely seven (7) years.

On the merits, it is sufficient, for purposes of this
motion, to say that the ground of appeal sought to be raised is, in my opinion,
one of substance and difficulty; its importance is obvious; if the applicant's
contention is upheld he will have been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in
excess of the maximum term permitted by law.

Counsel for the respondent submits that we are without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing an appeal against the sentence passed by the trial Court.

Counsel for the applicant bases his application on s.
597(1)(b) of the new Code which reads:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

* * *

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the
judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the
Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

It will be observed that this application falls within the
literal meaning of the words quoted. The applicant is a person who has been
convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and he seeks leave to appeal to this Court on a question of
law. It is important to observe that the present section does not say ""may
appeal against the affirmance of such conviction"" as did its
predecessor. It is contended for the

[Page 74]

respondent, however, that other provisions of the Code, the
history of the legislation and the jurisprudence dealing with it require us to
construe s. 597 as giving a convicted person a conditional right of appeal
against his conviction only and not against his sentence. It is pointed out
that s. 583 which confers upon a person convicted of an indictable offence the
right of appeal to the Court of Appeal distinguishes between (a) an appeal
against conviction and (b) an appeal against sentence, and that this
distinction is maintained in sections 592 and 593 the former of which sets out
the powers of the Court of Appeal on an appeal against conviction and the
latter the powers on an appeal against sentence.

The respondent also relies on the decision of this Court in Goldhamer
v. The King5.
In that case the appellant had been found guilty of an indictable offence
and sentenced by the trial court to pay a fine of $400 and in default of
payment thereof to be imprisoned for six months; he immediately paid the fine;
the Attorney-General of Quebec appealed to the Court of King's Bench under s.
1013 of the Criminal Code and that Court increased the sentence by
adding thereto a term of imprisonment for six months; Bernier J. dissented but
gave no reasons for his dissent. The appellant thereupon appealed to this
Court. The question of jurisdiction was raised by the Court in the course of
the argument. Judgment was reserved and the appeal was in due course dismissed.
Duff J., as he then was, Mignault J. and Malouin J. were all of opinion that
there was no right of appeal and dismissed the appeal on that ground. Idington
J. was doubtful as to the Court's jurisdiction but thought that, in any event,
the appeal should be dismissed on the merits. He said in part at p. 292:

I cannot therefore confidently assert and hold that there is
no appeal possible under such circumstances as involved herein.

Maclean J. simply concurred in the dismissal of the
appeal. The ratio of the majority is found in the reasons of Duff J. at p. 293:

As my brother Idington points out, the word ""conviction""
cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive
meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification including

[Page 75]

the sentence. Section 1013 does, however, I think,
distinguish very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for the
purposes of appeal, and the Act of 13–14 Geo. V., by which the present section
was brought into force, made no change in section 1024. Accordingly, I think
the word ""conviction' in the last mentioned section should be read in its
less technical sense, and consequently that there is no right of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an
appeal under subsection (2) of section 1013.

and in the reasons of Mignault J. (with whom Malouin J.
agreed) at pages 293 and 294:

Our jurisdiction is governed by article 1024 of the Criminal
Code, which states, with a proviso which need not be mentioned here, that any
person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed
on an appeal taken under article 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada against the affirmance of such conviction.

As now amended, article 1013 gives a right of appeal against
a conviction, and against a sentence pronounced by the trial court against a
person convicted on indictment. Article 1024 was not amended by the 1923
statute and under it the right of appeal is restricted to an appeal against the
affirmance of the conviction. Reading it with article 1013, as amended, the
appeal from the sentence under paragraph 2 of article 1013 cannot be brought
before this Court.

When Goldhamer was decided the sections referred to
in the passages quoted, so far as relevant, read as follows:

1013 (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the
court of appeal against his conviction—

(a) on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone; and

(b) with leave of the
court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit
case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact
alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the
court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal.

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney
General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge
of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the
trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

* * *

1024. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of
appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless

[Page 76]

notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney
General within fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may
be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

(2) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or
order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new
trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the
justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and
orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.

The section now in force which corresponds with s. 1013
quoted above is s. 583 of the new Code reading as follows:

583. A person who is convicted by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction

(i) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of law alone,

(ii) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact, with
leave of the court of appeal or upon the certificate of the trial judge that
the case is a proper case for appeal, or

(iii) on any ground of appeal not
mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) that appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal, with leave of the court of appeal; or

(b) against the sentence passed by the trial
court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

For the purposes of the problem before us the differences in
wording between this section and s. 1013 are not significant.

When, however, s. 597 of the new Code is compared with s.
1024 under which Goldhamer was decided it will be observed that there
are the following points of difference; (i) as pointed out above, the words in
s. 1024 ""against the affirmance of such conviction"" have disappeared;
(ii) while under s. 1024 the appeal to this Court was at large, provided there
was a dissent in the Court below, the rights of appeal given by s. 597 are
restricted to questions of law; (iii) under s. 1024 the time for appealing ran
from ""such affirmance"" but under s. 597 it runs from the day when
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced""; the usual meaning of the
word ""judgment"" in criminal matters is, in my opinion, correctly
stated in the Dictionary of English Law by Earl Jowitt (1959) at p. 1025:

In criminal proceedings, the judgment is the sentence of the
court on the verdict of the jury, or on the prisoner pleading guilty to the
indictment. Where the jury acquits the prisoner, the judgment is that

[Page 77]

he be discharged; if he pleads guilty or is convicted, the
judgment declares the punishment which he has to suffer, e.g., death,
imprisonment, fine, etc.

These three differences appear to me to be sufficiently
substantial to prevent the decision in Goldhamer being regarded as
decisive of the question before us.

I have already indicated my view that this application falls
within the literal wording of s. 597; and the terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do
not appear to me to require us to construe s. 597 in the limited sense
contended for on behalf of the respondent.

If the meaning of the words used were ambiguous it would be
proper to consider the apparent intention of Parliament in enacting s. 597 in
its present form, as appearing from the history of the legislation. One of the
primary purposes appears to me to have been to confer upon this Court a
jurisdiction, to determine points of law arising in cases of indictable
offences, wide enough to ensure uniformity in the interpretation of the
criminal law throughout Canada. That purpose would be pro tanto thwarted
if we were to hold we are without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law
as to whether a sentence imposed is or is not authorized by statute.

In my opinion no sufficient reason has been advanced for
interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a jurisdiction which appears to me to be
conferred upon the Court by the words of that section construed in their
ordinary and literal meaning.

There is another line of reasoning which leads me to the
same conclusion. Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act is in pari
materia with s. 597 of the new Code. Both sections deal with the
jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave to appeal from decisions of
provincial Courts.

In Rex v. Loxdale6,
Lord Mansfield said:

Where there are different statutes in pari materia though
made at different times, or even expired, and not referring to each other, they
shall be taken and construed together, as one system, and as explanatory
of each other.

[Page 78]

Section 597 of the Code has already been quoted.
Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act read as
follows:

41 (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

* * *

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

The words of subs. (1) unless they are cut down by the
opening phrase, ""Subject to subsection (3)"", are obviously wide
enough to confer jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal affirming the sentence of 12 years' imprisonment passed upon
the applicant; it is a judgment, and indeed a final judgment, of the highest
court of final resort in the province in which judgment can be had in the
particular case, for ""judgment"" is defined in s. 2(d) as
follows:

(d) ""judgment"", when used with reference to
the court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree,
decretal order or sentence thereof;

If the words in subs. (3) ""the judgment of any court …
affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" are to be interpreted
as having the limited meaning ""affirming a verdict or finding of guilt
excluding the sentence imposed"" and not, to use the words of Duff J.,
quoted above, ""with a signification including the sentence"", it would
follow that the jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from sentence is not
excluded by the words of subs. (3) from the wide power given by subs. (1). From
this in turn it would follow that under subs. (1) this Court would have
jurisdiction to give leave to appeal from a sentence and such an appeal would
not be restricted to questions of law. It appears to me extremely unlikely that
Parliament intended this result; it

[Page 79]

can be avoided by construing the words ""the judgment of
any court … affirming a conviction … of an indictable offence"" so as to
include the affirmation of the sentence.

When s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act are read together it is my opinion that the word ""conviction""
in both sections should be read ""with a signification including the
sentence"" which construction gives effect to the apparent intention of
Parliament that our jurisdiction in criminal matters should be strictly limited
to points of law and yet wide enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation
of the criminal law throughout Canada.

It may be observed in passing that cases in which a sentence
can be questioned on a pure point of law are likely to be few and far between.

Having concluded that we have jurisdiction, I would, for the
reasons mentioned earlier, grant leave to appeal on the ground set out in the
notice of motion.

      2008/12475 R v Emma Barrett 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 10 March 2009 Emma Barrett pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge that on 23 June 2007 she murdered David Harrison. 
     
      
    2 The story leading up to this killing is quite a lengthy one. It started in rural South Australia in about 2004, when the offender first met the deceased, David Harrison. He was working as a supervisor at the Kooyong Dairy, where relatives of the offender were also working. The offender was aged 18 at the time, and already had two young children. 
     
      
    3 The offender and the deceased commenced a relationship, which was interrupted the following year when the offender was abducted by Mr Moslan, the father of her children. He forcibly detained her at gun point, and assaulted her, which in due course led to his being convicted and imprisoned for a number of criminal offences. The deceased in the meantime had moved back to his home in Victoria. His relationship with the offender resumed in 2006 when he returned to South Australia in order to give evidence in Mr Moslan’s trial. 
     
      
    4 Later in 2006 the offender moved to New South Wales where she lived for a time with the deceased at Curlewis, near Gunnedah. It was here that she first met her co-offender, Dean Fordham. Mr Fordham became extremely attached to the offender and her children. Probably for this reason, his relationship with the deceased was always an uneasy one, marked by considerable jealousy on both sides. 
     
      
    5 It was during this time at Curlewis that the offender took a document out of the deceased’s trouser pocket and showed it to Mr Fordham. She told him that it was the deceased’s hit list. This document was tendered in evidence on sentence. To any objective observer it is clearly a list of telephone numbers. It included the names and the telephone numbers of the offender and Mr Fordham. This document, and the emotions it engendered in both the offender and Mr Fordham, were central to the events which followed, and I shall be returning to it later. Suffice it to say here that Mr Fordham, an impressionable man of limited education and intelligence, totally accepted that this list was indeed the deceased’s hit list, and that the deceased was planning to harm him. 
     
      
    6 It is appropriate here to say a little more about the background of the deceased. He was 24 years old when he met his death. Over the years he had undertaken a number of jobs, mainly in a rural setting. He was a licensed firearms holder, as he sometimes had to put down sick animals. The evidence indicated that he had, from time to time, held himself out as a “hit man” who did contract jobs. I accept that, if he did say this he was, in effect, big noting himself. There is no acceptable evidence whatsoever, in my view, to support the proposition that he was in fact a contract killer, or a hit man, as the offender said she believed. 
     
      
    7 It is clear that the deceased was extremely fond of the offender, and wanted a full-time relationship with her. This became a source of conflict between them, as she did not want one with him, but she was not prepared to tell him so directly. 
     
      
    8 It is unnecessary for present purposes to chart the movements of the deceased and the offender through the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Suffice it to say that they had something of an on and off relationship during this period, some of which was spent in Victoria and some in New South Wales. 
     
      
    9 In March or April of 2007 the deceased returned to Victoria, after spending some time in New South Wales with the offender. He told his mother that he needed to get a job so that he could support the offender and her two children. 
     
      
    10 In May 2007 the offender and her children, together with the co-offender, Mr Fordham, moved into a house rented by Mr Fordham in Maitland Road, Muswellbrook. In the meantime the deceased remained working in Victoria. In the early stages he told his mother how much he loved the offender and her children, and that he wanted to be able to support them. However, over time his attitude soured, almost certainly because the offender was not responding to his messages. He sent a number of unanswered SMS messages to the offender early in June 2007. These expressed increasing frustration at her failure to respond. Finally, on 12 June, he sent four text messages to the offender in a little over two hours. These assumed considerable significance in the sentencing, and three of them bear repetition here. At 12.10 pm the deceased sent a message saying 
     
      
       
        
        “Your just like ya mum a using bitch fuck u I will make sure everyone knows where u are I will make life hell 4 u and ya kids r fucked” 
        
       
       
      At 12.37 the following message was sent: 
       
       
        
         “Like I say u fuck with my heart u get whats coming to u” 
        
       
       
      Finally, at 14.12 the following message was sent: 
       
       
        
        “Everythink I done fur u and us kids and u fucked me over u just an unfaithful bitch like ya family” 
        
       
      
    11 It is apparent in retrospect that it was these messages which ultimately sealed the deceased’s fate. 
     
      
    12 For some reason the offender did not receive these messages until Monday 18 June. She said that she understood them to be threats to harm herself and her children. I will be saying more about this later. There was then a flurry of telephone calls and SMS messages from her to the deceased in Victoria. That evening the deceased told his mother that he was going to Muswellbrook to help the offender move house. For that purpose he bought a second hand vehicle for $1,200.00. 
     
      
    13 It was at this stage, after receiving the deceased’s text messages, that the offender decided to kill the deceased. She said in evidence that it was Mr Fordham’s idea to kill him. However, for reasons I will give later, I do not accept this. I do accept that Mr Fordham became very angry when he saw these messages and that he readily agreed to go along with the offender’s plan. But it was initially her plan, not his, to invite the deceased to come to Muswellbrook and then to kill him. 
     
      
    14 In preparation for the killing the offender and Mr Fordham went to the central coast where they made a number of purchases. Mr Fordham bought a car for $500.00 which was registered in a fictitious name. The two of them bought a Wiltshire carving knife, which was the murder weapon, garbage bags, bleach and numerous sheets and blankets. The offender wrote a number of notes setting out various methods of committing the murder and disposing of the body. Police were subsequently taken by Mr Fordham to a place where these notes had been buried on his family’s property, together with clothing and footwear worn by the two of them during the killing. 
     
      
    15 The deceased left his home in Victoria after work on Thursday 21 June, telling his parents that he would be back in time for work the following Monday morning. He arrived at the Maitland Road house in the early hours of Friday 22 June. Rather than knock on the door, he climbed in through a window, which made the co-offender, Mr Fordham, very angry. 
     
      
    16 The initial plan for the killing was that some time during that first day the offender and Mr Fordham would lure the deceased into the garage on the property, where Mr Fordham would come up from behind and cut his throat. That plan failed, as the deceased did not want to go into the garage. The alternative plan was for the offender and the deceased to go out that night, and for Mr Fordham to stab the deceased on their return. This is the plan which was eventually followed. 
     
      
    17 The three of them, the offender, Mr Fordham and the deceased, spent most of that day in the Maitland Road house. A close friend of Mr Fordham had been killed in a car accident the previous day, and he spent much of the day on his own, consuming large quantities of alcohol. That night, well after the offender’s children had been put to bed, the offender and the deceased went out in his car, in accordance with the previously devised plan. The offender said that they sat in the car and talked. They were away from the home for about two hours. Shortly before their return, at about 2.00 am, while the deceased was out buying some food, the offender telephoned Mr Fordham to tell him that they would be arriving home very shortly. The offender said in evidence that she pleaded with him during this conversation not to proceed with their plan to kill the deceased. For reasons I will discuss later, I do not accept this. 
     
      
    18 When the car arrived back outside the Maitland Road property, Mr Fordham came out of the house carrying a knife concealed up his sleeve. When the deceased got out of the driver’s seat of the car, Mr Fordham stabbed him in the face. The deceased ran around the car towards the offender. He then started to run away towards the end of the street. The offender ordered Mr Fordham to go after him and bring him back. This he did. He caught up with the deceased, not far away, and walked him back to the house. The deceased was then taken to the back of the house and made to sit on a chair immediately outside a shed. It was there that Mr Fordham proceeded to inflict multiple stab wounds upon him. While this was happening the offender was, I accept, inside the house and was unable to see what was happening. In due course Mr Fordham joined her and they smoked some marijuana. Later she went outside and ran back in saying, according to Mr Fordham, “He’s still alive”. According to the offender, she said, “He’s hurt”. The precise words matter little. The two of them then ran out to where the deceased was lying and each of them inflicted a further stab wound. The offender said in evidence that she “felt forced” to do so because of the actions of Mr Fordham. However, I do not accept this. I believe that her action was entirely voluntary. 
     
      
    19 The two of them later put the deceased’s body into the boot of his car. Mr Fordham drove the deceased’s car, and the offender followed in the car they had purchased a few days earlier. They went to a remote location outside Greta, where they took the body out of the car and partially buried it. Later, they returned and completed the burial, pouring cement over the body. Later that day, while they were driving through Mayfield, a suburb of Newcastle, the deceased’s car ran out of petrol. They abandoned it there, breaking a window and removing the sound system in order to make it appear as if it had been stolen. 
     
      
    20 The deceased’s parents became concerned when he failed to arrive home, as planned, the following Monday, 25 June. On 28 June they reported him missing. On 30 June a police officer telephoned the offender asking about the whereabouts of the deceased. She said that he had left her home in the early hours of Saturday 23 June, saying that he was going to Newcastle. By that time, 30 June, the offender had made a number of concerted attempts to cover her tracks. Between 23 and 27 June she made no less than 28 voice calls and sent 14 SMS messages to the deceased’s mobile telephone. Moreover, in an undated letter, postmarked 28 June, she wrote to the deceased’s mother asking her to get the deceased to telephone her, saying that she had been trying to ring him but that he would not respond to her messages. On 2 July, in a telephone conversation with the deceased’s mother, the offender said, “David really loved me and I loved David very much”. 
     
      
    21 Late in June the offender and Mr Fordham moved out of the Maitland Road property. The offender and her two children moved into a refuge in Gosford. There the offender befriended a woman whom I shall call LS. On the evening of 16 July 2007 the offender told LS about the killing of the deceased. The next day LS reported the matter to the police. On the same day, 17 July 2007, the police interviewed the offender at Gosford Police Station. Her first reaction, when asked about the killing of the deceased, was, “I didn’t do anything, it was Dean. I told him not to do it, and I am not the sort of person who would do something like that”. She proceeded to describe the killing in a manner which placed all responsibility upon Mr Fordham. She said that he, Mr Fordham, was furious because the deceased had put him on his hit list. However, later in the interview she denied that she knew what was meant by a hit list, or that the deceased was capable of harming anyone. She did not call the ambulance or the police, she said, because she was scared of Mr Fordham. She described disposing of the body and returning to the Muswellbrook house where she said Mr Fordham forced her to clean the bloodstains. He, Mr Fordham, then proceeded to dispose of the bag containing the clothing they were wearing during the killing. 
     
      
    22 A further interview took place the next day, 18 July 2007. In this interview the police asked the offender about the account she had given to LS two days earlier, which was significantly more incriminatory than the account she had given to the police. She continued to downplay her role in the killing, saying that it was entirely Mr Fordham’s fault. She did not want to have anything to do with the killing, she said, but he made her play a role in it. She conceded that she stabbed the deceased once when she believed he was already dead. Later in the interview she said that she had become extremely angry because the deceased had threatened to harm herself and her children and tell the children’s father, Mr Moslan, where they were living. 
     
      
    23 After this interview the offender took police to the location near Greta where the deceased’s body was found. 
     
      
    24 The offender was then charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty, and the trial was due to commence at Newcastle on 9 March 2009. In the meantime, Mr Fordham had pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to give evidence against the offender in her forthcoming trial. After some negotiations between the Crown and the defence, the offender pleaded guilty to murder. This took place in Sydney the day after the trial had been due to commence, namely on 10 March 2009. The offender will obviously get the benefit of this plea in reduction of sentence. It hardly qualifies as an early plea, and must therefore be at the lower end of the range. However, as Mr Ramage QC, who appeared for the offender, pointed out, a lengthy trial involving a large number of witnesses was thereby averted. It was therefore of real utilitarian value. 
     
      
    25 This takes me to a consideration of the objective seriousness of this offence, which is the starting point in assessing the complex series of factors to be taken into account on sentence. I turn first to the aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as they relate to the offence as opposed to the offender. The aggravating features which are not inherent in the offence of murder are, pursuant to s 21A(2)(c), that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon; pursuant to paragraph (2)(e), that the offence was committed in company; and, pursuant to paragraph (2)(n), that it was part of a planned criminal activity. There are no mitigating factors in relation to the offence as opposed to the offender. 
     
      
    26 By far the most significant aggravating factor is the fact that the killing was deliberately and meticulously planned. 
     
      
    27 At this point it is appropriate to go back to the two significant factual matters which were disputed on sentence. These were: first, whether it was the offender or Mr Fordham who first conceived of the killing and directed its planning; and second, whether the offender sought to dissuade Mr Fordham from proceeding with the killing shortly before it was to take place. 
     
      
    28 I have already indicated my finding on the first matter, namely, that it was the offender who conceived the idea of killing the deceased. This is consistent with what she told LS, with the evidence of Mr Fordham and with virtually all the surrounding facts. It was she, not Mr Fordham, who received the so-called threats in the deceased’s SMS messages. It was she, not Mr Fordham, who wrote the various notes setting out the methods of executing the killing and disposing of the body afterwards. Mr Fordham, as I have said, is a person of very limited education and intelligence and I have no doubt that he was a follower rather than an initiator in this plan; a willing follower no doubt, but a follower nonetheless. 
     
      
    29 I also do not accept that the offender had a last minute change of heart and tried to persuade Mr Fordham to desist from the planned enterprise. Again, this was never mentioned to LS and is inconsistent with other evidence in the case. The telephone call from the offender to Mr Fordham shortly before returning home in the early hours of 23 June lasted only 21 seconds. Had she been genuinely trying to persuade him to desist from their planned venture, one would expect it to have been a longer call. Moreover, the offender admitted that, after the deceased had started to run away down the road, she urged Mr Fordham to go after him and bring him back. In her evidence she sought to give explanations for this which were both inconsistent and unconvincing. Indeed, there were many unsatisfactory aspects of her evidence. It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail them here, but there were numerous inconsistencies, on matters of substance, between the various versions that she gave to LS, to the police and to the court. There were also some matters on which her evidence was inherently implausible. 
     
      
    30 The killing was a particularly brutal one, involving no less than 35 stab wounds. Certainly the offender physically inflicted only one of these and was not present when most of the others were inflicted. Nevertheless, it was she who conceived the killing and planned its execution. It was she who did a great deal afterwards to dispose of any signs of the killing, and to deflect suspicion away from herself, particularly through making the various communications to the deceased’s mobile phone and to his mother. 
     
      
    31 What, then, motivated this bizarre series of events? To any objective observer the document which the offender described as the deceased’s hit list was clearly a list of telephone numbers. Certainly there were some veiled threats in the SMS messages sent by the deceased. The statement “I will make sure everyone knows where you are” was particularly disturbing for the offender, as Mr Moslan was due out of gaol at about that time and she was very concerned that he should not be able to locate her and the children. Nevertheless, on any objective basis, it was a totally disproportionate response to these veiled threats, for the author to be lured to Muswellbrook and brutally murdered. 
     
      
    32 The answer, in my opinion, must lie in the offender’s massive ingestion of drugs, particularly marijuana, as part of the substance abuse disorder suffered by the offender. I shall be talking about her background shortly. It is, on any view, an extremely sad one. For quite some time before the killing of the deceased she had been smoking between 20 and 30 cones of cannabis each day. As Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, commented, this had a significant and deleterious impact upon her judgment. Mr Watson-Munro noted that she had suffered a significant substance abuse disorder dating back to her early teenage years. He considered that the offender’s drug intake had aggravated her underlying symptoms, which included symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. 
     
      
    33 It is well established that drug addiction is not in itself a mitigating factor in sentencing for serious offences. The court cannot be seen as in effect condoning drug use by imposing lesser penalties for drug-related crimes. Those who choose to embark on drugs in the first place, and then maintain their addiction, must, the authorities say, accept the consequences. On the other hand, it has also been said that where the original addiction is not a willed act, that might be taken into account in mitigation. 
     
      
    34 The present case is, on any way of looking at it, a most unusual one. The large amounts of marijuana taken by the offender had so distorted and affected her judgment that she actually believed that the deceased posed some sort of a threat to herself and her children. This belief had no factual foundation, and was essentially the product of the offender’s defective judgment, which was in turn caused by her drug abuse. 
     
      
    35 In this most unusual situation I propose to treat the offender’s misguided belief that the deceased posed some sort of threat to herself and her children as a mitigating factor in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. Given the overall circumstances, it cannot be taken as a major mitigating factor, but it is not an insignificant one. 
     
      
    36 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this offence is “well above” the mid-range of seriousness for the crime of murder. Were it not for the offender’s belief that the deceased posed a threat to her and her children, a belief which was fuelled by her drug intake, I would have agreed with that assessment. Even with that mitigating factor, when one takes into account the degree of planning and the brutality of the killing (even though she was not physically present through much of it), I would still place this offence above the mid-range of objective seriousness, although not significantly so. 
     
      
    37 I turn now to discuss the offender’s personal background. She was born on 18 September 1986 and was only 20 years old at the time of this offence. She is now 22. She was born in Adelaide. Before she was born her parents separated and her mother commenced a relationship with another man. Until she was eight years old she believed that this manr was her real father. He used to assault her both physically and sexually and there was a great deal of violence in the home. At the age of 13 she discovered her real father. She went to live with him, but his partner was a woman much younger than him and only a few years older than the offender. The domestic relationships were difficult and, at about the age of 15, she left and went onto the streets where she effectively worked as a prostitute. It was there that she met the father of her children, Mr Moslan, with whom she maintained a relationship, albeit a difficult and not a constant one, for nearly two years. It was he who subsequently kidnapped and threatened the offender, leading to his conviction and imprisonment.  
     
      
    38 The offender did poorly at school and left at the age of 15. Since then she has acquired no training or skills, and has had no productive employment. 
     
      
    39 As I have already mentioned, the offender started to take marijuana or cannabis at the age of 12 and was already a heavy user at the age of 13. To quote Mr Watson-Munro, “in the absence of treatment for her already blossoming psychological problems, this drug offered her significant emotional release and in this setting she rapidly became addicted to it”. She remained addicted until her arrest and incarceration for this offence. 
     
      
    40 The offender’s children are being cared for in Barnardo’s Homes. She has been separated from them since her incarceration. This has undoubtedly imposed a significant additional burden for her. 
     
      
    41 The offender has no prior convictions. This is a significant matter in her favour on sentence. 
     
      
    42 There are a number of mitigating features arising from the offender’s personal history. They are: 
     
      
    · her plea of guilty· her prior good character· her prospects of rehabilitation· her youth· her expressed remorse. 
     
      
    43 I have already referred to the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was entered. It was a late plea, but nevertheless had some real utilitarian value. I propose to reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 12.5% on account of this plea. 
     
      
    44 The next three factors, namely, the offender’s prior good character, her prospects of rehabilitation and her youth, are all interrelated. Given the offender’s sad and disjointed upbringing, her time on the streets working as a prostitute, and the extent and duration of her cannabis addiction, it is somewhat of a surprise, even for a person so young, that she has no prior convictions. This must, as Mr Ramage submitted, stand her in good stead so far as her prospects of rehabilitation are concerned. I think I must assume that, if she can remain drug free, her prospects of rehabilitation will be good. She will be a different person when she comes out of prison, approximately twice the age that she was when she first met the deceased. She will, however, require a great deal of assistance and support. It is therefore appropriate that there be a significant period of parole. This constitutes special circumstances which break the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the total sentence. However, given the length of the overall sentence I am obliged to impose, this factor will not significantly affect the pattern of the sentence. 
     
      
    45 The offender has expressed remorse for this killing. The Crown submitted that I should not accept the genuineness of these statements of remorse, particularly given the concerted attempts the offender made to cover her tracks after the killing. However, as Mr Ramage pointed out, the fact that she attempted to escape detection for this crime is not necessarily inconsistent with remorse. I think I should give her the benefit of the doubt on this matter and treat her expressed remorse as genuine. 
     
      
    46 An extremely moving victim impact statement was read in court by the deceased’s mother, Mrs Jean Harrison. I would like to convey the Court’s and my own sincere condolences to the relatives of the deceased, particularly his parents who are here and who have been devastated by his death. 
     
      
    47 The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years. This has no direct application following a plea of guilty, but it remains a reference point in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    48 This is one of those cases where the major sentencing considerations point in different directions. Those relating to the offence itself almost all point in one direction, which is towards a heavier sentence. Those relating to the offender personally almost all point in the opposite direction, which is towards a lighter one. 
     
      
    49 The offender has been in custody since 17 July 2007 and her sentence must commence on that date. 
     
      
    50 Emma Barrett, for the murder of David Harrison, I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing on 17 July 2007 and expiring on 16 July 2023. That will be the first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole. I specify an additional term of six years, commencing on 17 July 2023 and expiring on 16 July 2029.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. I am sentencing Justin James Martin for the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. That is an offence under s25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
       and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. The drugs to which that particular section apply do not include cannabis and in this case the drugs which were being supplied on an ongoing basis were methylamphetamine. Mr Martin pleaded guilty, it is accepted, at the earliest opportunity. 
       
       
      2. Briefly this is what happened. Mr Martin was identified by the police intelligence as a supplier of amphetamines in the Armidale area. Police set up an operation involving undercover operatives. Those undercover operatives made contact with Mr Martin over a period of some days and he supplied them with drugs on each of the days. 
       
       
      3. On 11 September 2006 he supplied them with .2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $80. On 12 September 2006 he supplied the same amount of drugs for the same amount of money. On the same day the undercover operative received a text message from Mr Martin indicating that he, Mr Martin, could organise the supply of further methylamphetamine from another source. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with .4 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $100. The next day, 13 September 2006, the amount was increased again. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with 31/2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $750. The final supply was on 19 September 2006, once again the quantity was increased. The undercover operatives handed Mr Martin $1,300 and in return he supplied them with 7 grams of methylamphetamine.  
       
       
      4. On the same day they indicated that they would pay $2,400 for 14 grams. Some days later a transaction occurred in which that amount of methylamphetamine was supplied in exchange for $2,400. On the day of that supply, which was 26 September 2006, the police terminated the operation and arrested Mr Martin. He made full admissions in his record of interview after his arrest. 
       
       
      5. The offences, I have said, carry a maximum of twenty years. In  
      Regina v Smiroldo 
       (2000) 112 A Crim R 47, Hulme J, with whom Sheller JA and Dowd J agreed, discussed s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      ,  
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          It was introduced 
          ”, his Honour said, “ 
          to target dealers who had organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of the drug legislation by dealing only in small quantities at a time 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      His Honour observed that the Minister said that the quantity of drugs supplied was, so far as s 25A was concerned, immaterial. On the other hand Hulme J pointed out that obviously, in accordance with sentencing principle, the amount or the quantity of the drug should be a relevant factor for sentencing. 
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          It would be relevant to consider 
          ”, his Honour said at [14], “ 
          whether an offender, convicted of an offence under the section had sold three lots of 1 kilogram each or three lots of 1 gram. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
      His Honour went on to say in the following paragraph 
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          The persons at whom s 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      6. In this case the magnitude of the operation was relatively modest. As Mr Falcomata, who appears for Mr Martin, pointed out, the overall quantity of the drugs involved were some 10 grams, that is twice the indictable amount. It was, he pointed out, significantly below the commercial quantity, which is 250 grams. It was, it seems, a relatively small scale street enterprise. In addition it is to be noted that in accordance with the evidence of Mr Martin, whom Mr Falcomata called to give evidence, the remuneration he received for his drug supplying activities was in the form of helping himself to the drug which was supplied, a process referred to as taxing. On the other hand it is clear that Mr Martin was prepared to increase the amounts which he sold in response to the demand of those to whom he was selling it. He did not appear to baulk at the opportunity of increasing the amount sold. 
       
       
      7. Mr Martin, so far as his personal factors are concerned, has pleaded guilty, as I have indicated. Not only that but he has told the police that he is prepared to give evidence against the person supplying him, a man named Shane Young. That person is facing trial and there is, amongst the exhibits, an undertaking by Mr Martin that he will give evidence against Mr Young. He confirmed that, at least in skeletal outline, in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. 
       
       
      8. Mr Martin has no record of previous offending for this type of behaviour. His record contains only a couple of traffic matters. He is therefore not in need of a particularly strong degree of personal deterrence, which would be the case for someone with a criminal record which was relevant. 
       
       
      9. There was also tendered in the proceedings a pre-sentence report. It refers to Mr Martin’s history of drug taking, which was confirmed by Mr Martin in his own evidence. In his own evidence he indicated that he had used alcohol and cannabis from a young age. He stopped drinking alcohol after his second traffic conviction. He smoked cannabis for about five years. He was drug free for some years from 2002, but in 2005 commenced to use amphetamines. He became addicted fairly quickly. 
       
       
      10. Whilst I am referring to his evidence, he has a child, a boy named Corey, born on 16 April 2005. The mother of his son has moved to Western Australia. She moved some five months ago because Mr Martin was in prison. It is clear that Mr Martin is attached to his son emotionally and misses the opportunity to see him. Mr Martin assures me that he will remain drug free and will not commit this sort of offence again. Whilst he has been in remand he has seen a counsellor concerning his drug activity and he is going to be or has been assessed for a residential drug rehabilitation facility called The Glen. 
       
       
      11. Returning to the pre-sentence report, it says that he, Mr Martin, 
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          recognises that he will encounter different pressures upon his return to the community, and the environment of a residential rehabilitation facility may allow him to develop strategies which will assist him to remain drug free 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      It noted that he appeared genuine in his expressions of remorse. It offered an opportunity to supervise Mr Martin and to monitor his progress and performance. It assessed him as suitable for both Community Service and Periodic Detention. He has demonstrated his interest in rehabilitation by the courses which he has undertaken in prison, as well as by a previous course which he undertook concerning persons who drive with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood. I note that he ceased drinking alcohol after one of those offences.  
       
       
      12. Mr Falcomata called Ms Cheryl Jones, Mr Martin’s mother. She noticed an improvement in her son since he has been in custody and made it clear that on his release, she will provide a home for him and support his rehabilitation. 
       
       
      13. So the question is what sentence I should impose upon Mr Martin. Mr Falcomata submits that a non parole period in the order of eighteen months would be appropriate, and the Crown Prosecutor does not add anything by way of submissions apart from reminding me to bear in mind the discount and the appropriate stage at which to apply it. 
       
       
      14. This is a serious offence created, as I said, by Parliament to target those who make it a business to sell drugs in the community. That is exactly the business that Mr Martin was engaged in. The fact that he did not derive a benefit in the form of money but instead in the form of drugs for his own use, does not reduce the fact that he was engaged in a business. The fact that he was being paid small amounts in the form of supporting his own drug addiction does reduce the criminality of the behaviour, nevertheless he was prepared to increase the amounts in accordance with demand. 
       
       
      15. Parliament, as I said, has fixed a maximum penalty of some twenty years imprisonment for this sort of offending. Taking into account that the overall amounts supplied by Mr Martin were relatively small and that the business enterprise was relatively small in its scale. In my opinion an appropriate commencing place before discounts for an offence such as this, is less than the halfway figure of ten years, and it seems to me that a figure of eight years overall imprisonment would be an appropriate starting place.  
       
       
      16. However Mr Martin has pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse and has also indicated that he is prepared to assist the authorities. Mr Falcomata has referred me to s 23 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        
      and I have taken into account the relevant factors there. In accordance with the authorities it seems to me that an appropriate discount is in the region of forty percent for his combined assistance and the plea of guilty, including remorse. This reduces the overall sentence to something over four and a half years.  
       
       
      17. However I also take into account that his prospects of rehabilitation appear to be quite good. He has demonstrated in the past his capacity for rehabilitation and his prospects on being released from prison are good because of his close and supporting relationship with his mother. In addition he is serving, so far, his custody in protection. That is because of his size, he is a relatively small stature, and his lack of confidence. He will therefore serve his term of imprisonment in somewhat harsher conditions or more deprived conditions than might otherwise have been the case. 
       
       
      18. Taking these various factors into account, I am prepared to further reduce the sentence to just over three years. I have in mind, as the overall penalty, a sentence of forty months. Mr Falcomata invited me to set a parole period which is longer than the normal statutory ratio. There are, I am satisfied, special circumstances which warrant this. In this case his need for supervised rehabilitation would be assisted or promoted by a longer than normal parole period. I am therefore going to set a non parole period of twenty months. The sentences will all date from the date of his arrest, 26 September 2006. 
       
       
      19. So Mr Martin I am going to sentence you to an overall period of three years and four months, that is forty months, commencing 26 September 2006 and concluding on 25 January 2010. I set a non parole period for the sentence, which is the minimum period that you have to be kept in detention, of one year and eight months, that is twenty months, to commence on 26 September 2006 and to expire on 25 May 2010. The balance of the term is also to be one year and eight months, that is twenty months, it will commence on 26 May 2008 and expire on 25 January 2010. The earliest date at which it appears that you will be eligible for release to parole is therefore 25 May 2008. 
       
       
      So I do not make a parole order, do I gentlemen, because it is over three years. 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes that’s right. 
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Nor do I fix conditions. I think that is probably all Mr Crown-- 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --and Mr Falcomata. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: There’s no other orders I need to make. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Martin do you understand you have been sentenced to three years and four months, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: That is forty months, it all dates from when you were arrested on 26 September last year, half you must serve, the other half on parole, and that is provided the Parole Board releases you. I cannot order that, it is a matter for the Parole Board or the Parole Authority, but you will become eligible to be considered for release on parole on 25 May 2008 and your overall sentence after parole expires 25 January 2010, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
       
       oOo

 Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):
Introduction
1       These were two related appeals brought by the accused person (hereinafter referred to as “the Appellant”) and the Public Prosecutor, respectively, following a trial and the finding of guilt by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) against the Appellant on three sexual offence charges and the acquittal of the Appellant of a single charge of impersonation under s 170 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“s 170” and “the Code” respectively). CCA No 7 of 2013 (“CCA 7”) was the Appellant’s appeal against the convictions found against him as well as the sentences imposed. CCA No 8 of 2013 (“CCA 8”) was the Public Prosecutor’s appeal against the acquittal.
2       At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed CCA 7 but allowed CCA 8 and convicted the Appellant on the charge of impersonation. We now give our reasons.
The Charges
3       The charges which were brought against the Appellant were as follows:
 
1
st
 Charge:
 [You, the Accused] sometime in the afternoon of 16 July 2010, in Singapore, did pretend to hold the office of a public servant, 
to wit
, a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force, knowing that you did not hold such office, and in such assumed character did inform [the Complainant] [DOB], female/ then 16 years old, that you would bring her to the Police Station if she did not have sexual intercourse with you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 170 of the Penal code, Chapter 224.
 
2nd Charge:

4       The Judge acquitted the Appellant on the 1st charge on the ground that it had not been proven but convicted him on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th charges. The Judge then sentenced the Appellant to:
(a)     1 year imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane for the 2
nd 
charge;
(b)     11 years’ and 5 strokes of the cane for the 3
rd
 charge; and
(c)     11 years’ and 5 strokes of the cane for the 4
th
 charge.
The Judge also ordered the prison sentences for the 3rd and 4th charges to run concurrently and the 2nd charge to run consecutively with the 3rd and 4th charges. The total sentence was therefore 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
Background facts
5       At the time of the alleged offences, the Appellant, a 39 year old technician, was married with two young children. He lived at Block 647 Woodlands Ring Road. The victim was a 16 year old secondary four student (“the Victim”) at a school located in Tampines. She lived near her school. She was then in a relationship with a 20 year old polytechnic student (“PW23”). The Victim and PW23 came from Muslim families. The Victim broke up with PW23 following the alleged offences. We shall refer to the Victim and PW23 collectively as “the couple.”
The circumstances leading to the confrontation
6       On the afternoon of 16 July 2010, after school, at about 2.30 pm, the Victim met up with PW23 who drove her in his Kia Cerato (“the Kia”) to a multi-storey carpark at Block 685 Woodlands Drive 73 (“the Carpark”). PW23 drove up to the 5
th
 storey of the Carpark and parked the Kia at Lot 621. Soon after, they started getting intimate with each other inside the Kia.
(A)   Victim’s evidence
7       According to the Victim, while she was in the midst of fellating PW23 in the backseat of the Kia, the couple noticed the Appellant’s white Mazda CX-7 (“the Mazda”) driving past the Kia.
[note: 1]
 Soon after this, PW23 ejaculated and cleaned himself up using a piece of tissue paper which he threw out of the right rear window of the Kia.
[note: 2]
8       Thereafter, the couple started to have protected sexual intercourse. At some point, PW23’s condom tore and he proceeded to put on another condom. After a few minutes,
[note: 3]
 the Victim observed that the Mazda had parked at Lot 629 (about seven lots away from the Kia).
[note: 4]
9       The Victim told PW23 that she was not comfortable with the presence of the Mazda. PW23 went out to see if there was anyone in the Mazda. After a minute or two, PW23 returned and told her that there was someone at the driver’s seat in the Mazda.
10     The couple continued to engage in sexual intercourse but only for a few minutes. Thereafter, the couple returned to the front seats of the Kia. They talked and PW23 also had a smoke. Soon, they got aroused again and the Victim fellated PW23 for the second time.
[note: 5]
(B)   Appellant’s evidence
11     The Appellant said that on that same day, at or around 3pm, he drove the Mazda from his home to collect some electronic goods for his employer from a vendor at Senoko Drive. On the way towards Gambas Avenue, he saw two boys behaving suspiciously at the staircase of the Carpark. The Appellant averred that he had previous unpleasant encounters with people who littered around his neighbourhood. He therefore decided to see what the two boys were up to.
12     He drove up to the 5
th
 storey of the Carpark and parked the Mazda at Lot 629. He walked down one of the Carpark staircases and found the two boys smoking and saw them throwing their cigarettes butts onto the ground. He chastised them for littering and told them to dispose of the cigarette butts properly (which they did).
13     The Appellant then returned to the 5
th
 storey of the Carpark. While he was about one car length away from his Mazda, he saw a man in a red shirt (who was PW23) looking at his Mazda before turning back towards the direction of the Kia. The Appellant returned to the Mazda and started to use his phone. He then saw someone throwing a tissue out through the right rear window of the Kia. Having just told off the two boys for littering, he got upset that someone else was committing the same anti-social act. After a short while, he got out of the Mazda and approached the Kia, intending to admonish the litterbug. As he approached the Kia, the Appellant noticed that the Victim was in the act of fellating PW23. He then knocked on the window on the driver’s side.
The confrontation
(A)   Victim’s evidence
14     According to the Victim, the Appellant asked PW23 to step out of the Kia and further asked PW23 whether he had littered. He also inquired as to what the couple were doing in the Kia. Moments later, the Appellant asked the Victim to get out of the Kia and also demanded to see their identity cards (“IDs”). As the Victim only handed over her EZ-Link card which did not have her address on it, the Appellant demanded to know where the Victim was staying. She eventually revealed to the Appellant that she stayed in Tampines. PW23 admitted to the Appellant that they were having sex and that he was the one who had littered. The Appellant then proceeded to take photographs of the litter below the Kia.
15     The Appellant told the couple that he was doing his rounds with his team. He said that he saw what they were doing and that he would bring them to the police station and charge them. He also said he had just caught two boys taking drugs in the Carpark. The couple begged him not to bring them to the police station. He then said he would give them a chance if the Victim would follow him as he wanted to make sure that the Victim returned home safely as he did not trust PW23. He also asked PW23 to go home and to meet the Appellant later at the void deck of PW23’s flat to discuss what the latter had done.
[note: 6]
 Embarrassed and afraid of getting into trouble with her parents as well as with the law in relation to what she and PW23 were doing in the Kia, she complied with the Appellant’s instructions and got into the Mazda.
(B)   Appellant’s evidence
16     The Appellant did not materially dispute the Victim’s account as set out at [13] above. However, he said that after speaking to PW23 on the right side of the Kia, he walked over to the left side of the Kia and found condom wrappers and tissues on the floor. It was only then that he took photographs of the litter. The Appellant also asked PW23 whether the condom wrappers and tissues on the left side of the Kia were thrown by him which he admitted.
[note: 7]
17     The Appellant denied saying that he was doing the rounds with his team. Instead, he claimed that he told PW23 that he was going to call the police and inform them that PW23 had littered in the Carpark. PW23 begged him to refrain from doing so. The Appellant claimed that after the Victim revealed that her home was in Tampines, she volunteered to show the Appellant where she stayed and said that he could send her home.
[note: 8]
 The Appellant agreed and even told PW23 that he could come along. PW23 declined and said that it was fine for the Appellant to send the Victim home.
18     The Victim then took her belongings from the Kia and sat in the front passenger seat of the Mazda. According to the Appellant, at that point, his thoughts were:
[note: 9]
In my mind, er, I feel that she---she voluntary [sic] said that she wanted to show me the place and I think she feel very comfortable, er, following me to show me that place which I was, er, very normal of me of the way of--- I did talk to them and, erm, she really wanted to show me the actual place that where she stay.
19     At a certain juncture in the conversation at the Carpark (it is unclear from the Appellant’s evidence when this occurred), the Appellant also told the couple that he would like to call her parents to inform them that she was at the Carpark with PW23. The couple begged the Appellant not to do so.
20     It was not in dispute that the following events took place in the Carpark after the Appellant’s confrontation with the couple:
(a)     Before the Appellant returned to the Mazda, he asked PW23 to remove the litter from below the Kia which PW23 duly did.
(b)     Before the Appellant drove off from the Carpark, PW23 called the Victim to ask if she was all right. The Appellant overheard the conversation and told PW23 not to worry.
[note: 10]
(c)     At the Appellant’s demand, the Victim gave him PW23’s as well as her own handphone (“HP”) number. In order to verify those numbers, the Appellant gave the Victim’s HP a missed call and then proceeded to call PW23.
[note: 11]
The drive to Tampines Industrial Avenue 4
(A)   Victim’s evidence
21     According to the Victim, after leaving the Carpark, the Appellant drove to a dead-end road. There, he told the Victim that it was up to her as to whether he would take her to the police station to be charged. He added that he would let her go only if she were to “please him” and explained that “please him” meant that he wanted the Victim to have sex with him. He also said that he would “delete all pictures that he took of [her] and [PW23] doing things after [she] please[d] him, if [she] did what he asked [her] to”.
[note: 12]
 The Victim cried and begged the Appellant not to do that. Eventually, the Victim agreed to have sex with the Appellant to which the latter said “so this is what you want ah”.
[note: 13]
22     At some point (it was unclear from her testimony as to the exact moment this occurred), the Victim received another call from PW23. This time PW23 told her to keep her HP on. The Appellant noticed that and made her terminate the call.
[note: 14]
23     While driving towards Tampines, the Appellant pointed to a building along the way and claimed that it was the Woodlands Police Station and that he was a policeman from “the J Division” and that the Victim could find his photograph there.
[note: 15]
 The Appellant kept talking about police related matters and repeated that he was a policeman doing his rounds with his team at the Carpark to check on people who were dealing in drugs.
[note: 16]
24     Upon exiting the Tampines Expressway (“TPE”) near Ikea Tampines, the Appellant asked the Victim where they could have sex. When she refused, he said he could still bring her to the police station even though they were now in Tampines. He also indicated to the Victim that he was unfamiliar with Tampines. The Victim pointed to the old Tampines area where there was on-going construction work and old buildings, 
ie
, Tampines Industrial Avenue 4. Once the Appellant reached the area, he parked the Mazda between two trailers.
(B)   Appellant’s evidence
25     The Appellant denied having taken the Victim to a dead end road to threaten her. Instead, he said that he headed directly towards the Seletar Expressway (“SLE”) after he exited the Carpark. The only point at which he stopped was at a traffic junction and the only question he had asked her there was as to the direction he should take to go to Tampines. In reply, she told him that they could take the SLE towards the TPE and thereafter she would give him directions.
26     Along the journey, the Victim got “very comfortable” with the Appellant and told him that she was offering a “service”. When the Appellant asked what that was, the Victim replied that she could provide him with “sex service”. She offered the Appellant sex for $200. The Appellant claimed that his mind then was “totally away”
[note: 17]
 and he accepted the offer. By that point, they were driving along the TPE and he asked her which exit he should take and where they could have sex. The Victim then directed him to Tampines Industrial Avenue 4.
The sexual encounter between the Victim and the Appellant
27     According to the Victim, after the Appellant had parked the Mazda, he walked over to the left side of the Mazda to open the door for her. He asked the Victim to come out of the Mazda and move to the left rear seat. She complied. He then walked over to the other side and entered the Mazda from the right rear door.
28     The Victim said that at that point she did not run away because the Appellant was taller and bigger than her. She also did not shout for help as she was afraid he might hit her. Moreover, they were in a deserted area where no one was in sight. In addition, she was reluctant to run away because her bag, EZ-Link card and HP were still in the Mazda.
29     On this aspect of the evidence the version of the Appellant did not materially differ from that of the Victim except that the latter had opened the front passenger door herself.
30     The sexual activities described in the 2
nd
, 3
rd
 and 4
th
 charges then took place between the Appellant and the Victim in the backseat of the Mazda. It was not disputed that the sexual encounter lasted only for a very short period of time.
[note: 18]
Events after the sexual encounter
31     According to the Victim, after they put on their clothes, the Appellant drove her towards the Tampines bus interchange. At that point, the Victim read a text message from PW23 who had asked her to take down the licence plate number of the Mazda. As he was driving, the Appellant told the Victim that she “was lucky that it was not his other partner who was a Malay man who was a very pious man and that no mercy would be [shown] on [the Victim] if it were his partner who had caught [her].”
[note: 19]
 The Victim alighted at a bus stop near the Darul Ghufran Mosque at Tampines Avenue 5, but before that, the Appellant showed the Victim that he had deleted all the photographs he had taken of her and PW23 at the Carpark and that he had also deleted the Victim’s and PW23’s HP numbers from his HP. After alighting from the Mazda, she called PW23 and told him that the Appellant had raped her. She then went home.
32     According to the Appellant, after they put on their clothes, the Victim asked for $200 which he had earlier agreed to pay for her services. He then took out a $50 note from his wallet to pay her. He claimed he only paid her $50 for two reasons. First, he did not enjoy the sex. Second, and more importantly, he did not have enough cash with him since the whole encounter was not planned. Because he could not pay the Victim the agreed sum, she became very unhappy and angry and asked him to drop her home.
Decision Below
33     The Judge acquitted the Appellant on the 1
st
 charge because:
(a)     The evidence was not sufficiently cogent or consistent to show that the Appellant indicated to the couple that he was a police officer.
(b)     Even if he did say he was a police officer, more was required before one could be convicted of a s 170 offence.
34     However, the Judge convicted the Appellant on the 2
nd
, 3
rd
 and 4
th
 charges because in his view the version of the events as recounted by the Appellant was “highly improbable” whereas the Victim’s account was also corroborated by PW23, PW23’s cousin and the Victim’s family.
 
Accused’s appeal against conviction
 
35     We first consider the Appellant’s appeal against his conviction on the three sexual offence charges. The main grounds of appeal put forward by the Appellant were as follows:
(a)     The Judge was not justified in finding that the Victim’s account of the offences was “unusually convincing”;
(b)     The Judge erred in holding that the Victim’s account was corroborated when there were inconsistencies in the evidence tendered by the Prosecution and when an adverse inference should have been drawn against the Prosecution for the non-production of certain evidence; and
(c)     The Judge erred and was inconsistent when he convicted the Appellant on the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 charges and yet held that the sexual encounter was not induced by the Appellant impersonating a police officer.
The question of consent
36     The charge of outraging modesty under s 354(1) is made out if the Prosecution establishes that an accused had used criminal force on a complainant with the intention of outraging her modesty. Criminal force is defined under s 350 of the Code as the use of intentional force on a person without that person’s consent. The charge of sexual assault by penetration under 376(1) is made out if the accused penetrated the complainant’s mouth with his penis without her consent. The charge of rape under s 375(1) is made out if the accused penetrated the complainant’s vagina with his penis without her consent.
37     The central element in relation to all the three sexual offence charges, therefore, was the question of consent on the part of the Victim. If the Appellant had proven that the Victim had consented to the sexual encounter in the Mazda at Tampines Industrial Avenue 4, then clearly the convictions recorded against him on the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 charges could not stand. Although the Code does not define “consent”, s 90 provides that:
 
90
.    A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —
(a)    if the consent is given by a person —
(i)    under 
fear of injury
 or wrongful restraint to the person or to some other person; or
(ii)  under a misconception of fact,
and the person doing the act 
knows, or has reason to believe
, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception…
[emphasis added]
Section 44 of the Code also provides that :
 
“Injury”
 
 
44
.    The word “injury” denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, 
reputation
 or property.
[emphasis added]
38     It is clear that pursuant to s 90 read with s 44 of the Code there is no consent if the Prosecution can show that the consent given by a complainant was made under fear of injury to her reputation and the accused knew or had reason to believe that the consent was given in consequence of such fear.
39     In the present case, the Prosecution did not explicitly address the point why there was a lack of consent on the part of the Victim. But we hardly think that there was any need to do so. On the Victim’s version of the events, it was clear that she consented to have sex with the Appellant because of her fear of being exposed by the Appellant as to what she and PW23 did in the Kia at the Carpark and that the Appellant took advantage of this. On the Appellant’s version, the Victim consented to have sex with him as a business transaction, 
ie
, for payment. If there was valid consent, then the convictions must be set aside. This probably explained why both the Prosecution and the Appellant proceeded on the basis that the pivotal question at trial was whose version of events – the Victim’s or the Appellant’s – was the truthful one.
Applicable legal principles on appeal
40     It is settled law that an appellate court will not lightly disturbfindings of fact of the trial judge unless they are clearly arrived at against the weight of the evidence: see 
Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601
 (“
Liton
”) at [32]. Where a case turns on the evidence of the complainant against that of the accused, the court should only convict the accused if the complainant’s evidence is “unusually convincing”. This has been described in 
Liton
 at [39] as:
testimony that, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused.
41     Otherwise, corroborative evidence would be required to secure a conviction. If such corroborative evidence is required, the trial judge should first identify the aspect of the evidence which is not so convincing before looking for supporting evidence and ask whether, in taking the weak evidence together with the supporting evidence, he is convinced that the Prosecution's case is proved beyond a reasonable doubt: 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR(R) 444
 at [44] and [68] and 
Kwan Peng Hong v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 2 SLR(R) 824
 at [35].
42     Our approach to corroborative evidence is a liberal one. In determining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration, one has to look at the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate: see 
Liton
 at [43] (for the English common law definition of corroborative evidence, see 
R v Baskerville
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
).
Was the Victim’s evidence unusually convincing?
43     The Victim’s testimony (as summarized above) was internally consistent and credible and satisfied the test of being unusually convincing. Like the Judge, we had no doubt as to what transpired on that eventful day. Before this fateful day, the Appellant was a total stranger to the Victim. It is wholly conceivable that a 16 year old girl from a Muslim family caught in the same compromising position as the Victim would have behaved in the way that she did in order to prevent her parents from finding out that she had sex with her boyfriend. Why would the Victim leave her boyfriend (PW23) at the Carpark and go with a complete stranger in his car if she had not been coerced or threatened? It is simply unbelievable that the Victim would, out of the blue, offer the Appellant sexual service for payment, bearing particularly in mind the Appellant’s claim that when he was confronting the couple at the Carpark he offered to take her home for her protection. We also noted that it was PW23, and not her, who insisted that a police report be made. This showed her concern as to what her parents would have thought with regard to her conduct.
44     On the other hand, we found that the Appellant’s testimony was internally inconsistent and defied belief. It may be noted that when the Appellant was interviewed at the Criminal Investigation Department on 18 July 2010 (two days after the alleged offences) and 28 July 2010 (12 days after the alleged offences) he denied that oral sex took place. Yet at trial he accepted that the Victim did perform oral sex on him and was unable to satisfactorily explain this inconsistency.
45     Further, the following points made in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at the trial were indeed germane:
(a)     In relation to the two boys whom the Appellant purportedly also caught littering, the accused could not explain why he did not ask them for their IDs, or tell them that he would call the police or their parents or take photographs of the litter which they had thrown.
(b)     It was inconceivable that the Victim would voluntarily go into the Mazda and offer to show a complete stranger where she lived, especially when this stranger had just moments before threatened to expose what she had done in the Kia to her parents and the police.
(c)     It was inconceivable that a schoolgirl who had been caught by an allegedly law-abiding citizen would suddenly turn around and offer sexual services to him in exchange for money.
(d)     The Appellant was unable to explain his sudden change in attitude from a person who was concerned about the safety of a young girl (thus wanting to send her home) to one who would immediately agree to have sex with her. The Appellant was also unable to explain why he decided to send the Victim home to Tampines which was certainly not on the way to Senoko Drive (where he was supposed to have picked up, on behalf of his employer, some electronic goods from a vendor).
(e)     If the Victim was a sex worker and had indeed offered sexual services for money, it was inconceivable that she would cry rape and expose herself to the stress of a trial (as well as letting her parents know what she had done at the Carpark) merely because she was short-changed of $150.
The central theme of his defence that the Victim had, in his car, offered him sexual services for payment was simply bizarre.
Corroboration by PW23
46     Even if the evidence of the Victim were to require corroboration, the testimony of PW23 amply substantiated what she had said as far as what happened at the Carpark was concerned. Very briefly, PW23 said:
(a)     He picked the complainant up from her school in Tampines at about 2:30pm.
[note: 20]
(b)     He drove to the Carpark where they started being intimate with the Victim performing oral sex on him at the front seats of the Kia. However, because of space constraints they moved to the back seats where the Victim continued to fellate him.
[note: 21]
(c)     Later, while the couple were having sexual intercourse in the backseats of the Kia he observed a vehicle, the Mazda, pass by his vehicle.
[note: 22]
 He and the Victim then stopped their activity and watched the Mazda which made one round and then parked at Lot 629. They continued hugging and kissing. After a while, PW23 got dressed and stepped out of the Kia to check on the Mazda and he saw a man inside with his head down. He assumed that the man was talking on his phone. He then returned to the Mazda to update the Victim.
(d)     Being reassured by what PW23 told her, and considering that the back seat of the Kia and the front seat of the Mazda was blocked by a pillar,
[note: 23]
 the couple continued with their activity, including changing the condom he was wearing and putting on a new one. He estimated that from the moment he saw the Mazda parked at Lot 629 until the time he put on the new condom, there could be a lapse of some 15 to 20 minutes.
(e)     After PW23 ejaculated, the couple cleaned themselves up and got dressed. PW23 then threw the tissues and condom wrappers out of the left rear side of the Kia.
[note: 24]
(f)     They then got out of the Kia to get some fresh air and returned to the front seats where they talked and listened to the radio. It was then around 4pm. Soon after, they got aroused and the complainant began to fellate PW23 again.
(g)     The Appellant knocked on the window of the Kia and asked for their IDs.
[note: 25]
 The Appellant asked the Victim where she stayed and told the couple that he was from an authority so they had “better tell the truth”.
[note: 26]
 The Appellant also told them that he was at the Carpark doing some checks and that he had seen teenagers at the Carpark taking drugs and that he had a van with warrant officers inside. PW23 believed that he was from “CNB or CID”.
(h)     The Appellant took a picture of the litter on the ground and said he was going to press charges against PW23 for littering.
[note: 27]
(i)     The Appellant then gave the Victim and PW23 two options: the first was for PW23 to return home himself and the Appellant would send warrant officers to check on him at his home while the Appellant would send the Victim home. The second was that he would send both of them to the police station.
(j)     As PW23 and the complainant were afraid that their parents might find out what they did, and not wanting trouble, they agreed to the first option.
(k)     On the way down the Carpark building, PW23 called the Victim. Soon after he terminated the call, PW23 received a call from a private number which turned out to be the Appellant. PW23 estimated that he exited the Carpark at about 4:30pm.
[note: 28]
(l)     Between 4:30pm and 5:30pm, he sent the Victim a text or made a call to her (he could not remember which) asking her to take down the vehicle number of the Mazda.
[note: 29]
47     In light of the foregoing analysis of the evidence, we agreed with the Judge that the Victim’s testimony was strongly corroborated by PW23’s testimony. On a review of all the evidence we were satisfied that the Appellant had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.
Prosecution’s appeal against acquittal
48     Next, we turn to the issues relating to the impersonation charge under s 170 in respect of which we set aside the decision of acquittal of the court below and instead recorded a conviction against the Appellant. The following were the inter-related issues which were pertinent to the charge:
(a)    What are the elements of the offence of “personating a public servant” under s 170?
(b)     Did the Judge err in holding that the offence of impersonation under s 170 required stricter proof than someone merely saying that he was a police officer?
(c)     Was the Judge’s finding in relation to the 1
st
 charge against the weight of the evidence?
The law
49     Section 170 of the Code reads:
Whoever pretends to hold any particular office as a public servant, knowing that he does not hold such office, or falsely personates any other person holding such office, and in such assumed character does or attempts to do any act under colour of such office, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.
It is not in doubt that a police officer is a “public servant” as defined in s 21 of the Code.
50     To date it would seem that the local authorities have not discussed the elements of this offence in any great detail. Nevertheless, it is clear from the wording of s 170 that the offence can be committed in two manners:
(a)     First, if:
(i)       X, who knows that he is not a public servant, 
pretends
 to be such a public servant; and
(ii)       in that assumed character, X does or attempts to do any act under colour of the office of such a public servant.
(b)     Second, if:
(i)       X 
personates
 any person who is a public servant; and
(ii)       in such an assumed character, X does or attempts to do any act under colour of the office of that public servant.
51     According to 
The Oxford English Dictionary
 (prepared by J A Simpson and E S C Weiner) (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989), “pretend” means “to put forth an assertion or statement (expressed by an [infinitive]) about oneself; now usually implying mere pretension without foundation: to feign 
to be
 or 
do something
” [emphasis in original] (Vol XII at p 431-432). In the same dictionary, “personate” means “to assume or counterfeit the person of (another), usually for the purposes of fraud; to pretend to be, pass oneself off as” (Vol XI at p 604). It is clear that the second manner of committing the offence requires the accused to take on the specific identity of another person who is a public servant. Since the Appellant in this case did not do so, this court was only concerned with the first manner of committing the offence.
52     As regards the first element under s 170 of “pretends to be such a public servant” (see [50(a)(i)] above), the Judge held that “the offence of impersonation of a police officer requires stricter proof than someone merely saying that he was a police officer” (see the GD at [4]). It was not clear to us what exactly the Judge was suggesting when he said that “stricter proof” was required. Did he mean that as a matter of law the Victim’s evidence needed corroboration? If that was what the Judge meant to suggest, we would respectfully disagree. On the other hand, if he meant to say that on the evidence, he felt it unsafe to convict without corroboration that would be different.
53     In the present case one must bear in mind the charge preferred against the Appellant, which was that he, having pretended that he was a police officer, threatened the Victim that if she did not have sexual intercourse with him he would bring her to the police station (in relation to what she and PW23 had done in the Kia at the Carpark) (see [3] above). Obviously, pretension can come in various forms. Express words would be the most obvious situation. To the extent that the Judge seemed to think that express words were a necessary requirement, we do not agree. One can feign to be a police officer even without expressly uttering or saying so. For example, a conviction under s 170 was also recorded against an accused who flashed a card with the words “Tanglin Police” on it and said that he worked in a police station: see 
PP v Christopher s/o M P Nathan
 
[2000] SGHC 43
. In our view, the context and the words used and/or the actions of the alleged offender would be crucial. It would be foolhardy for any court to lay down hard and fast rules as to what words or actions would be sufficient to constitute pretension as a police officer. Ultimately, the court must be satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the totality of the evidence adduced, that the accused had pretended to be a police officer and under colour of that pretension proceeded to do an act or attempted to do the act.
54     Furthermore, we would add that, if someone merely says that he is a police officer and does nothing beyond that pretension, no offence under s 170 would have been committed as he would not have done any act, or attempted to do any such act, pursuant to that pretension. Both the first and second elements of the offence under s 170 must be made out. But if a person, who is not a police officer, says to another person that he is a police officer and then proceeds to demand to see the ID of that other person, the offence under s 170 would have been committed. A case in point is 
Sarjit Singh Rapati v PP
 
[2005] 1 SLR(R) 638
 where the accused falsely represented to be an “immigration officer” and demanded to inspect the work permit of his victim who worked in a restaurant. His conviction was upheld on appeal. What we would underscore is that s 170 does not impose any stricter requirement of proof going beyond demonstrating that the accused has pretended that he is a public servant and pursuant to that pretension proceeded to do an act.
55     As regards the second element under s 170 of “does or attempts to do any act under colour of such office” (see [50(a)(ii)] above), the act done or attempted to be done by the accused need not be an act which that public servant (that the accused pretended to be) could legally have done. There are two lines of authorities in the Indian jurisprudence on this issue. In 
Emperor v Aziz-Ud-Din
 [1905] ILR 27 All 294 (“
Aziz-Ud-Din
”) the judge said:
It is not in my opinion necessary for the application of the section that the act done under colour of office should be a legal act on the part of the accused. If he pretended to be a police officer and as such pol ice officer tried to extort money or things from a fruit-seller, I think the offence under s 170 was committed.
However, in the case of 
Biswanath Mukherjee v State of West Bengal
 [1966] LNIND 1966 CAL 206 (“
Biswanath
”), the Calcutta High Court held that because of the phrase “under colour of such office” in s 170, the act done, or attempted to be done, must be an act which the accused could legally do under the colour of that office which he pretended to hold.
56     On the authority of 
Biswanath
, a person who pretended to be a police officer and then threatened to report his victim for some alleged wrongdoing unless his victim pay him a sum of money would not have committed an offence under s 170. We agree with the Prosecution that the approach taken in the 
Biswanath
 line of authorities would seriously undermine the effectiveness of s 170 and lead to a rather strange result. It would mean that a s 170 offence would have been committed if the act done under pretence as a public servant fell within the scope of duty of that public servant, but not if an illegal act (which is likely to be more heinous) was done in pursuance of such a pretence. This would be outrageous as the more heinous the act which the impersonator carried out the less likely he would be caught by s 170.
57     At this juncture we would refer to an important Malaysian Federal Court decision in 
Tomm Wong v PP
 
[1973] 1 MLJ 215
 (“
Tomm Wong
”) where this very issue came under consideration. There, the accused went to a police station to lodge a report and pretended to hold the office of a detective police constable. The magistrate court acquitted the accused of a charge under section 170 of the Malaysian Penal Code (which was in 
pari materia
 with our s 170). The High Court set aside the acquittal but a question of law in these terms was referred to the Malaysian Federal Court for an opinion:
Do the words ‘in such assumed character does or attempts to do any act under colour of such office’ appearing in s 170 of the Penal code refer only to such acts as could legally be done by a person who in fact and in truth holds such office or do such words also cover acts which fall outside the permitted limits of the actual authority or power conferred or vested in the public servant whose character the accused pretends to assume.
The Federal Court, having noted that the Indian authorities were not in unison, preferred the position expounded in 
Aziz-Ud-Din
 and held:
[A]n offence under this section is committed whenever any person falsely holds himself out to be a public servant, and does or attempts to do any act whatsoever under colour of such office. The harmless character of that act or attempt may be relevant as to punishment, but the offence under s 170 is nonetheless committed whenever any act is done or attempted to be done by a person impersonating a public servant.
For the reasons alluded to in [56] above, and bearing in mind the clear wording of s 170, we endorse the views of the Federal Court in 
Tomm Wong.
Problems with the Judge’s finding
58     We note that in coming to his decision on the impersonation charge, the Judge, although he did refer to what the Appellant said to the Victim on the way to Tampines (GD at [4]), appeared to focus very much on what was said by the Appellant to the Victim and PW23 at the Carpark. It was not disputed that the Appellant did not, while the parties were at the Carpark, say that he was from the police (see GD at [3]). Nevertheless, during the journey to Tampines, the Appellant clearly represented to the Victim that he was a police officer. Furthermore, while the Judge noted that the Victim testified that the Appellant said that he was a civilian, she did explain that she understood this to mean that the Appellant was an officer in civilian attire.
[note: 30]
 As to the reason the couple complied with the Appellant’s threats, the Judge was of the view that they did so because “he seemed fierce and looked like he could cause them trouble” (See GD at [4]). However, in coming to this conclusion it appeared that he disregarded what the Appellant had clearly said to the Victim during the journey to Tampines.
59     As stated above at [40], an appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge unless they are clearly arrived at against the weight of the evidence. However, with respect, we found that in coming to his decision, the Judge focused too much on what transpired at the Carpark and did not have the charge specifically in mind. As mentioned at [53] above, the charge against the Appellant was that on the pretension of being a police officer he threatened to bring the Victim to the police station for what she and PW23 did at the Carpark if she did not agree to have sex with him (“the sex threat”).
60     In our opinion, the following were the critical facts which clearly established the impersonation charge :
(a)     At the Carpark, the Appellant asked the couple for their ID (see GD at [3]). The Judge stated that neither the Victim nor PW23 “clearly believed he was a police officer” but that they thought that the Appellant might be someone “with authority”. We pause here to reiterate that, given the compromised position in which the Appellant caught the Victim and PW23, and having regard to the words and actions of the Appellant, any reasonable person in similar circumstances would have believed that the Appellant was a police officer or someone from an enforcement agency. It would not matter that the couple, at that point, were unsure as to whether he was a police officer or not. The object of the provision would be seriously undermined if a victim must fully believe that the accused was who he pretended to be before the offence could be made out.
(b)     The Appellant, while not denying that he did ask to see the IDs of the couple, explained that he did so because he wanted to verify if they belonged to his “hometown”.
[note: 31]
 This explanation is ridiculous and made no sense. Obviously, for motives of his own, he wanted them to think that he was a police officer since a police officer had the authority to ask a member of the public for his ID. In furtherance of that pretension, the Appellant also gave the couple two options (this fact was accepted by the Judge): either he would send both of them to the police station and charge them or he would, for the Victim’s protection, send her home alone.
(c)     After leaving the Carpark the Appellant drove to a dead-end road where he made the sex threat to the Victim. Along the way to Tampines, the Appellant pointed in a certain direction and said that that was the Woodlands Police Station and further told the Victim that he was from “the J Division” and that she could find his photograph there. There could be no doubt as to what this utterance represented and this was of critical importance to the impersonation charge. We did not think it mattered whether the Victim absolutely believed that the Appellant was a police officer. There may have been a slight doubt in her mind but she was unsure enough that she decided not to call his bluff. The fact that she did not challenge the pretended authority of Appellant because of fear, or for any other reason, was immaterial to the commission of the offence.
61     We found great difficulties with the Judge’s views when he said that he was not satisfied “even if the [Appellant] had said in the course of his verbal exchange with [the couple] that he was a police officer, that was sufficient to amount to an impersonation of a police officer”. Granted that, as stated in [52] above, if the Appellant had just moved away after making that statement, no offence of impersonation would have been committed because in that scenario he would not have done any act or attempted to do any act under colour of that pretension. In the present case more did happen. The Appellant proceeded, under the pretence of being a police officer to make the sex threat.
62     We note that in relation to the sexual offence charges the Judge had found the version of the events as narrated by the Victim to be “the true account” (GD at [10]) and preferred her version of the events over that of the Appellant, thus rejecting the latter’s assertion that the sexual act with the Victim was consensual. In our view, the Judge’s finding on the impersonation charge could not be sustained in light of his own other findings and is in any event wholly against the weight of the evidence.
63     In our judgment, the Judge had erred in these respects. First, in holding that the Appellant had not pretended to the Victim that he was a police officer. Second, in finding that even if the Appellant had explicitly said that he was a police officer that would not, in the circumstances of the present case, be sufficient to constitute a s 170 offence; he seemed to suggest that something more was required before a s 170 offence could come into being. Yet the Judge did not elaborate, in the context of this case, what that something more should be but only said that “stricter proof” was required. In the result, we set aside the acquittal and convicted the Appellant on the 1
st
 charge.
Appeal against sentence
64     It is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb the sentence imposed by the trial court unless it is satisfied that (a) the judge erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing; (b) the judge failed to appreciate the materials placed before him; (c) the sentence was wrong in principle; or (d) the sentence was manifestly excessive or inadequate, as the case may be: 
Public Prosecutor v UI
 
[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500
 at [12].
65     The following are the punishments prescribed in the Code for the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 charges:
(a)     Outrage of modesty: imprisonment of up to 2 years, and with a fine or caning (s 354(2) of the Code).
(b)     Sexual assault by penetration: imprisonment of up to 20 years, and with a fine or caning (s 376(3) of the Code).
(c)     Rape under s 375(1)(a) of the Code: imprisonment of up to 20 years, and with a fine or caning (s 375(2) of the Code).
66     Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (which was the provision in force at the time the Appellant was charged) provided that where at one trial a person was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court would order the sentences for at least two of those offences to run consecutively. The equivalent provision in the current Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) is s 307.
Benchmark Sentence for “Category 1” Rape
67     In 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor
 
[1992] 1 SLR(R) 63
 (“
Frederick
”), the Court of Appeal held (at [20]) that in a contested case the benchmark sentence for rape without any aggravating or mitigating factors would be 10 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. In 
PP v NF
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849
, the High Court termed this as “Category 1” rape. A “Category 2” rape would be a case which involved the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim. A “Category 3” rape would involve the repeated rape of the same victim or of multiple victims. A “Category 4” rape would be one where the offender has demonstrated that he would remain a threat to society for an indefinite period of time.
68     In 
Frederick
, the offender was supposed to drive his girlfriend’s nephew’s 16-year old girlfriend home but instead drove her to a deserted road where he forced her to masturbate and fellate him before raping her. The offender was charged – and pleaded guilty to – one charge of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). This court took into account as mitigating factors (a) his guilty plea, (b) his cooperation with the police and (c) the unlikelihood of re-offending. However, the court did not take into account the fact that the offender did not use violence against his victim. Instead the court took into account as aggravating factors the fact that (a) the offender was in “something of a responsible position of trust” and (b) the offender had forced his victim to put up with the additional indignity of masturbating and fellating him. The offender was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.
69     It would be noted that the benchmark sentence of 10 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane set by this court in 
Frederick
 was for a rape without aggravating or mitigating factors and where the offender claimed trial. In 
Frederick
 itself the court imposed a somewhat below the benchmark sentence of eight years because the offender pleaded guilty. However, the caning imposed was two strokes higher than the benchmark of six presumably because of aggravating circumstances. For the present case, we were of the view that the benchmark set in 
Frederick
 was applicable as the Appellant claimed trial to the charges.
70     Like in 
Frederick
, there were aggravating factors in the present case. Here, the Appellant had placed himself in a quasi-position of trust since he had told PW23 as well as the Victim that he would send the Victim home. In addition, he made the Victim suffer degradation (in relation to the acts described in the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 charge) before being raped. On the other hand, we could not see any mitigation in favour of the Appellant. While we recognised that no physical violence or threat of violence was inflicted on the Victim we were unable to view that as a mitigating factor as he had effectively put her in so much fear that she was not able to resist his demand.
71     In light of the above, and bearing in mind the benchmark set in 
Frederick
, we did not think that the sentence of 11 years and five strokes could be regarded as manifestly excessive for the 4
th
 charge. While the prison term imposed was one year longer than the benchmark, the caning was one stroke less. Moreover, as said before, there were aggravating factors with no mitigating factors.
72     No arguments were advanced to disturb the sentence imposed for the 3
rd
 charge which ran concurrently with the sentence for the 4
th
 charge; nor for the sentence for the 2
nd
 charge which ran consecutively with the sentences for the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 charges. Accordingly, the sentences for the 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 charges were upheld.
The sentence for impersonating a police officer
73     Finally, there remains the question of the appropriate punishment for the impersonation charge on which we had found the Appellant guilty. The law prescribes that a person who impersonates a public servant contrary to s 170 of the Code could be imprisoned for up to two years, or be fined or both. The commentary in the 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (LexisNexis, 3
rd
 Ed, 2013) at page 1086, states:
The offence (in s 170 of the Penal Code) is intended to prevent persons from performing unlawful or unauthorized acts under colour of purported official authority. It also guards against the danger that the reputation of public servants will be tarnished or their authority undermined when an offender purports to act under colour of such official authority.
Whether a fine or imprisonment is appropriate would depend essentially on the nature of the act done under colour of the office. If the act was innocuous, then a fine would be appropriate. However, if there were aggravating circumstances, for example, the consequences of the act were serious to the victim or where a vulnerable victim was taken advantage of, a custodial sentence would be justified.
74     In 
Iskandar bin Abdul Rahim v PP
 
[2001] SGDC 46
, the offender pretended to be a police officer and conducted a check on his victim. He requested his victim to follow him to the police station to verify her identity. While in the car, he outraged his victim’s modesty under the pretext of doing his job as a police officer. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for the s 170 charge and 12 months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane for outraging his victim’s modesty.
75     In the present case, given the heinous motive behind the impersonation, and the tarnish caused to the reputation of the Singapore Police Force, we were of the opinion that an appropriate sentence would be an imprisonment term of six months. However, as this charge formed part of the same transaction as the 2
nd
 to 4
th
 charges, it was only appropriate and just that this sentence should be ordered to run concurrently with the existing global imprisonment term of twelve years and we accordingly so ordered.

17,3006262,Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw: R v Stephen Port,"R v Stephen Port 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw 

Central Criminal Court 
25th November 2016 

 

Following a lengthy trial, Stephen Port falls to be sentenced following his conviction for four 
separate offences of murder; the mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, but I must 
consider whether to fix a minimum term and if so for how long; in order to do so I must set out the 
facts of these dreadful offences, and indeed the facts of the other serious sexual assaults committed 
upon seven other victims. The evidence took fully four weeks, I seek now only to summarise the 
facts in broad outline. 

The defendant Stephen Port is now aged 41. The evidence establishes that his sexual preference is 
for penetrating very young men, whom he has rendered unconscious by the surreptitious 
administration of drugs. His drug of choice was GHB (or the closely related GBL), about which the 
evidence was given by a distinguished forensic toxicologist. The drug was originally manufactured as 
a medical anaesthetic. Now, often known simply as ‘G’, it is abused in low dosages to produce short‐
lived euphoria: however, beyond low dosages, the drug is highly dangerous, since the resultant 
toxicity, can cause dizziness, nausea, then in sequence drowsiness, unconsciousness and eventually 
coma, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest and death; the precise mechanism of death may vary, as was 
explained by the forensic pathologists who gave evidence at the trial.  

One of the particular dangers presented by the drugs is that, whether presented as a dissolved 
powder or as a liquid, it is colourless and so can readily be used to ‘spike’ a drink without detection; 
the characteristic taste can readily be masked by mixing it with other strong flavours. 

Victim A 

The earliest a victim was A, an intelligent and articulate university student who in 2012 had just 
turned 19. He made contact with the defendant on Grindr, a gay dating website. He went to the 
defendant’s flat; they chatted, the defendant seemed to him to be polite and friendly, his mood was 
relaxed; there was, he said, ‘nothing to ring alarm bells’. He was then given a glass of red wine, 
which he drank; he noticed congealed powder at the bottom of the glass, he immediately suspected 
that his drink had been spiked. He described how he became dizzy and disoriented; his balance and 
thought processes were disturbed. He then lost unconsciousness; he was aware that he had been 
taken into the bedroom, undressed and raped by the defendant but he felt mentally and physically 
unable to resist because of his drugged state.  

 

1
--------
On his return to university, he made an immediate complaint to a friend and indeed sought medical 
advice because he believed that he had been drugged. 

He came forward to the police following the report of the defendant’s arrest.  

This gives rise to the charge in count 1 of administering a substance with intent to stupefy or 
overpower the victim, so as to enable the defendant to engage in sexual activity with him contrary 
to section 61(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and to the charge of rape in count 2. 

Victim B  

B was aged 20 at the time that he met the defendant through another gay website in June 2014. He 
also said that, at first, he felt quite safe and comfortable with the defendant whom he thought to be 
‘a very nice guy’. He also was induced to take a (non‐alcoholic) drink, which rendered him 
immediately unconscious. When he came round, he described what he called the terrifying effect: it 
felt as if he had no control over his body, he was shouting and screaming and calling out for help.  

The defendant took him to the station at Barking, still in this state; there, officers from the Transport 
Police officer saw him distressed, incoherent, unsteady on his feet and producing green vomit. 
Significantly, the defendant said that he (B) had taken ‘G’. 

B was not able to say with certainty that the defendant had penetrated him in this condition, 
therefore there is no charge of rape, just a count of administering a substance with intent, as 
charged in count 3.  

When the jury came to consider the defendant’s knowledge and intention in relation to the next 
victim, Anthony Walgate, they will no doubt have had in mind the effect that he knew that that the 
administration of the drug had had upon A and B.  

Anthony Walgate 

I come then to Anthony Walgate, who was aged 23. He had come down to London from Hull to 
study. In her victim personal statement, which of course I have read with and sympathy, his mother 
describes Anthony as being clever, funny and talented; all he ever wanted was to be a famous 
fashion designer and with his passion and determination, she was sure that he would have made it. 

One of his friends said that he was not very good at managing his money with the result that he 
resorted to working as an occasional gay escort. However, he took such precautions as he could: he 
always obtained the client’s address in advance, and secured a photograph, which information the 
always posted to others so that they would know where he was and indeed who he was with.  

Through a gay website the made contact with the defendant, and arranged to meet at Barking 
station on the evening of the 17 June 2014; they agreed that he would be paid £800 for an all‐night 
session. Since the defendant had no savings of any kind, and certainly did not have access to £800, I 
do not think that he had the slightest intention of paying.  

From a later examination of Anthony Walgate’s Oyster card, confirmed by the cell siting of his 
mobile phone, it can be established that he arrived at the station just before a quarter past 10, that 
evening.  

He was never seen alive again; nor was his telephone ever used again. I think that the inevitable and 
irresistible inference is that the defendant deliberately administered a drugs overdose to Anthony 
Walgate, with the intention of penetrating him whilst he was unconscious, which I have no doubt he 
did.  

 

2
--------
For a variety of reasons, which were explained by the pathologists, it is not possible to say precisely 
when Anthony died, but I am quite sure that he was dead when the defendant calmly went to work 
on the late shift the following day.  

He returned from work at about 4 o’clock in the morning of now the 19 June. By this time he had 
dressed Anthony’s body, which was probably already stiff with rigor mortis; he then dragged the 
body to deposit it on the path outside; he had planted in his pocket a small bottle of GHB, so as to 
give the impression that Anthony had died from a self‐administered overdose; he then removed and 
disposed of Anthony’s mobile phone, by which he feared that the contact between them would be 
traced. He then telephoned the ambulance reporting that he had, by chance, come upon the body 
young man collapsed outside his house. There Anthony’s body was found. 

He then repeated that version in a witness statement.  

The pathologist reported that the GHB levels in Anthony’s body were so high as to cause death by 
drugs toxicity. 

 Later, the defendant was interviewed again; even when the police put to him that they had 
discovered that the defendant had met Anthony through an on line dating app., he denied it.  

He then changed his story to suggest that Anthony had visited him at his flat but that his death was 
the result of a self‐administered overdose. The defendant said that he moved the body outside out 
of panic, lest the police should quite mistakenly think that he had in some way been responsible for 
his death; he even suggested that he feared that they might suspect him of murder. 

His earlier lies led to his conviction for an offence of perverting the course of justice, and a short 
prison sentence; there the matter rested, his later story being apparently taken at face value. 
Whether the police were right to do so, in the light of what they knew or ought to have found out, is 
for others to decide having thoroughly inquired into the matter, which it has not been appropriate 
for us to do in the course of the criminal trial.   

He repeated his later story in the course of his evidence to the jury, which they understandably 
rejected. 

These events give rise to his conviction for murder as charged in Count 4, and administering a 
substance in count 6.  

The jury were discharged from reaching a verdict on the alternative charge of manslaughter as 
charged in count 5 (as indeed they were on other such alternatives in counts 8, 11 and 24).  

Gabriel Kovari 

Gabriel Kovari was a 22‐year‐old Slovakian, who moved into the defendant’s flat on the 23 August 
2014.  

It is, I think, quite clear that the defendant had designs upon Gabriel Kovari: the day after he moved 
in, the defendant asked a friend to come and meet ‘his new Slovakian twink flatmate’, and the next 
day he wrote, suggestively as it seems to me, that he was ‘taking good care’ of him. There are some 
indications that his feelings were not reciprocated, for example Gabriel Kovari sent a text to a friend 
saying that he had slept on the sofa and did not want to sleep in the same bed as the defendant; the 
friend warned him that the defendant would want to do so. 

The last message set by Gariel Kovari’s phone was at 5 o'clock on the morning of the 25th; he had not 
been there for two days. In the light of what happened later, I draw the inevitable inference that 

 

3
--------
shortly after that call was made, the defendant surreptitiously administered drugs to Gabriel Kovari, 
intending then to penetrate him when he was unconscious; the overdose that he administered 
proved fatal. 

The next afternoon, that is to say the 26 August, the defendant changed his telephone number, and 
then told a friend that Gabriel had unexpectedly left. He gradually developed this story, adding a 
number of unconvincing details; he then claimed to have heard that Gabriel had gone off back to 
Spain where he had formerly lived with a partner. 

Using a false name, the defendant did eventually correspond with this former partner, Thierry 
Amodio but to him he told a completely different story, to which I will turn later. 

Meanwhile, by chance, the defendant sister rang him to find him in a very distressed state saying 
that there was the body of a young man in his flat, plainly that young man was Gabriel Kovari, 
although in his evidence to the jury the defendant told the most elaborate lie attempting to suggest 
that although he was speaking in the present tense, the body to which he was referring was Anthony 
Walgate, who had died several months before. 

Gabriel Kovari’s body must have remained in the defendant’s flat for some days because it was not 
until the morning of 28 August that it was found sitting against the wall of the churchyard in the 
ruins of Barking Abbey. It is not immediately clear how he moved the body, because he denied doing 
any such thing, however he had again planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket and had disposed of his 
mobile phone. 

The cause of death was a drug overdose, with very high and potentially fatal levels of GHB. 

The murder of Gabriel Kovari is charged in count 7 of the indictment; administering a substance to 
him with intent is the subject of count 9. 

I make entirely clear that I have read the victim personal statement given by Gabriel’s brother, who 
movingly describes the impact that his death has had upon the family. 

Daniel Whitworth  

I come then to Daniel Whitworth aged 23, he was a skilled and ambitious chef, who was making his 
way in a fiercely competitive world.  Again I have read the poignant memorials to him by members 
of his family who consider that they are facing a life sentence; they observed that they ha a rich and 
fulfilling life ahead of them with Daniel which has been stolen from them.  

He and the defendant made contact through a gay dating website, called Fitlads. After very many 
exchanges they agreed to meet on the afternoon of the 18th September; Daniel left work early and 
texted his partner to say that he would be late back, but he clearly contemplated only a short visit to 
the defendant’s flat in Barking. 

As to what happened after he arrived, only the defendant now knows, but at half past 10 the next 
morning, 19th September, he deleted his Fitlads account, the obvious and inevitable inference is that 
he did so because Daniel Whitworth was already dead and he was attempting to delete traces of 
their contact. 

That night, he carried Daniel Whitworth’s body to the grounds of Barking Abbey, where he dumped 
the body in more or less precisely the same position that he had disposed of Gabriel Kovari. As he 
had done with the others, he had planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket and stole his mobile phone, 
so as to conceal the contacts that they had had the one with the other. 

 

4
--------
The cause of his death was GHB toxicity. 

However, this time the defendant went further because he wrote what purported to be a suicide 
note written by Daniel Whitworth, explaining that he had deliberately taken a drugs overdose, 
consequent upon the remorse and guilt he felt at having himself administered the fatal overdose to 
Gabriel Kovari. 

It was that this story which he drip fed to Thierry Amodio, Gabriel Kovari’s partner in Spain, adding 
ever more elaborate inventions; the eventual story, which he told to the jury, was that Daniel 
Whitworth and Gabriel Kovari had met at a party, in Ilford, which the defendant had himself 
attended;  that with his knowledge and consent, Gabriel and Daniel had gone back to the 
defendant’s flat, that from there they had gone to the churchyard of Barking Abbey to have sex, that 
there Daniel Whitworth had administered a drug overdose to Gabriel Kovari, from which he had 
died, caused him such guilt that he later decided to take his own life. 

When the police eventually pointed out to him that the handwriting expert demonstrated beyond 
doubt that he (the defendant) had written the suicide note, he continued to maintain that he had 
not. He then changed his story and claimed that he had written the suicide note at Daniel 
Whitworth’s dictation. 

These were wicked and monstrous lies, which must have caused immense distress Daniel’s family. Of 
course, under cross‐examination this story unravelled and the truth emerged, that he had killed 
them both. 

The murder of Daniel Whitworth is the subject of count 10, count 12 charges him with administering 
a substance with intent. 

C 

Counts 13 and 14 alleged rape as against the witness C, with whom the defendant had a long 
standing relationship, which included many instances of consensual sex, some of which possibly – 
and perhaps even probably ‐ occurred when C was unconscious.  

It is therefore not in the least surprising that the jury might have been left wondering if they could 
be sure that C did not consent to what happened. 

I would however pay tribute to C’s courage in giving evidence; I do not doubt that some of the 
evidence he gave and certainly the CCTV footage of his engagement with the defendant may have 
informed their decisions on other counts. 

Victim D 

Victim D is aged 22, but he looked far less than his chronological age. He had some time been 
undergoing gender reassignment, but that transition process has recently been interrupted. He was 
suffering from the long term after‐effects of a head injury caused in a criminal assault. He was, in my 
judgment, acutely vulnerable.  

He described an occasion in January 2015, when he visited the defendant’s flat and his drink had 
been spiked, which had rendered him unconscious. Yet the defendant had penetrated him in his 
condition, to which the witness had not consented. The defendant filmed the incident and even 
showed it to D the next day; D was outraged at what had happened and protested in earthly 
language.  

This was charged as administering a substance with intent in charge 15 and rape in count 16. 

 

5
--------
Victim E 

I move onto E; aged 35, E was rather older than the others. He met the defendant on Grindr in July 
2015. 

As was clear in the exchanges that have passed between the defendant and C, the defendant had by 
now experimented with administering the drug anally, which he said led to a more immediate 
absorption of the drugs into the body.  

He pretended to E that he was applying lubricant inside his anus by a syringe type device, with a 
plunger or piston, which he called an applicator. E had consented to normal anal intercourse, but he 
had strong objections to the administration of drugs. Immediately after the defendant had inserted 
the applicator, E said that he flinched, having had an unpleasant sensation of burning or tingling, 
which caused a slight numbing. He knew that this was not right and immediately suspected that an 
attempt had been made to administer drugs to him. He managed to dress and left before any 
further offence could be committed. 

This gives rise to the allegation in count 17 of assault by penetration, contrary to section 2 (1) of the 
2003 Act. 

Victim F 

Victim F gave a very similar account. He met the defendant after exchanges on Grindr in August 
2015; he had made very clear in their exchanges that he did not himself take drugs. The defendant 
also applied the applicator to his anus on the pretence that he was supplying lubrication, but he 
immediately felt a pain ‘like a bite’, he said. His mind then went completely blank; he was shocked 
and felt dizzy and whilst in this state the defendant penetrated him. He said that his brain was not 
functioning properly; he eventually fell unconscious. He repeatedly said that he had not consented 
to the administration of the drugs and neither had he consented to being penetrated whilst 
unconscious. 

This gives rise to the allegations of assault by penetration as charged in count 18, administering a 
substance with intent as charged in count 19 and rape as charged in count 20. 

Victim G 

Victim G knew the defendant before. Contact was re‐established in September 2015 after they 
encountered each other on Grindr. G was insistent that he did not do drugs and indeed had spelt 
that out in their exchanges, which were exhibited. 

Again under the pretence of applying lubrication, the defendant inserted the applicator into G’s anus 
and administered drugs, thereby causing him an intense pain after which he became dizzy, as if he 
was drunk, but fortunately he did not fall unconscious and was able to leave. 

This gives rise to allegations was assault by penetration in count 21 and administering a substance 
with intent in count 22; because the defendant did not proceed to the full offence, there is no 
charge of rape. 

I have read G’s victim statement, in which he says that he feels somewhat responsible for the deaths 
of these young men and that he could and should have done something to stop it; there is nothing 
mire that he could have done; I pay tribute to his courage in coming forward to speak up now, as he 
did. 

Jack Taylor 

 

6
--------
I come then to Jack Taylor, aged just 25 lived with his parents in Dagenham working as a forklift 
truck driver. 

There is evidence that he had accessed gay dating websites before, but he was not ‘out’; there were 
strong indications that he did not voluntarily take drugs. 

After an evening of modest social drinking at a local club, he went home and accessed Grindr. He 
contacted the defendant and they agreed to meet at Barking railway station, which they did at about 
a quarter past three on the morning of 13 September. He then went back with the defendant to his 
flat. 

Again as to what happened there the defendant is now the only living witness. 

Just before 7:30 that morning the defendant blocked Jack Taylor’s account on Grindr, thereby 
deleting the string of messages that had passed between them. The inevitable inference was that by 
that time Jack Taylor was already dead. 

Later that morning the defendant deleted his own Grindr account. 

The defendant sent a series of messages discouraging his flatmate from returning to the flat that 
morning, plainly he did not want him to return to find Jack Taylor’s dead body, which must have 
remained in the flat all that day (the 13th); later that night he took the body to the churchyard; he 
positioned the body so as to appear as if he was sitting down, just over the wall from where he had 
left the bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth. 

He had planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket, he also planted a tourniquet and some medical wipes 
so as to give some credence to the story which he eventually told. As he had done with the others, 
he removed and disposed of his phone. 

The toxicologist found GHB at fatal levels; because Jack Taylor had been drinking at the club, and 
because drink and GHB can have a cumulative effect, the pathologist certified the cause of death as 
being a mixed drug and alcohol overdose. 

It is not to me to say whether the seeming bizarre co‐incidence of these three gay young men being 
found dead so close together might have given rise to suspicions that these deaths were not the 
result of ordinary self‐administered drug overdoses but that is how their deaths, including Jack 
Taylor’s death, was treated at the time; the competence and adequacy of the investigation will later 
be examined by others, as I have said. 

Accordingly, his body was released and was in due course he was buried. His family then had the 
distress – the devastation they called it ‐ of exhumation and a further post mortem to review the 
cause of death. 

When the defendant was first asked about Jack Taylor he said he did not recognise his name. He did 
not recognise his photographs. He had not been in contact with him on Grindr. Jack Taylor had never 
been to his flat; he had never had sexual intercourse with him. He had no involvement in his death. 
Indeed he even said that Jack Taylor was not the sort of person he would go for, since he said he 
tended to go for younger boys, whereas Jack Taylor looked older. 

When he gave evidence at the trial; he had changed his story. He said that Jack Taylor and indeed to 
his flat, that they had then moved into the churchyard to have sex. Jack Taylor administered drugs to 
himself, when he the defendant left him, he was alive and well and must therefore have died of his 
overdose afterwards.  

 

7
--------
Inevitably, as it seems to me, the jury dismissed this as a further pack of lies. 

I have read the joint tribute that Jack Taylor’s whole family have written in which they say he was an 
inspiration to them all: the life and soul of the family.   

His murder is charged as count 23; administering a substance is charged in count 25.  

Victim H 

I come then to victim H, who was then aged 24. He had had a sexual relationship with the defendant 
some years before. In October 2015, he was in crisis: another relationship had broken down; he was 
homeless; he had, he said, lost everything. He had taken to drink to blot out his many problems and 
turned to Stephen Port, the only friend he had in the world, for help. Mr Rees QC for the prosecution 
accurately described him as being acutely vulnerable. 

That month (October 2015), he went to stay with the defendant for two weekends. The described 
how during the first weekend, the defendant badgered him to take a line of drugs which he did; 
since this was with his consent, the taking of this drug does not form a count in the indictment. 
Following which the defendant did penetrate him, as he had done before. The witness said that he 
was too weak to argue with him. The jury, quite understandably as it seems to me, felt unable to be 
sure that this amounted to the offence of rape and acquitted on that charge as alleged in count 26. 

I come then to the second weekend, after voluntarily having snorted a line of drugs, the defendant 
using the applicator under the pretence that he was administering lubrication, injected into his anus; 
this was without his knowledge or consent and forms the subject of assault by penetration as 
charged in count 27 and administering a substance with intent as charged in count 28. The drugs 
caused him to feel drowsy, he had palpitations and lost consciousness during which time the 
defendant penetrated him, which was without his consent; this gave rise to the charge of rape in 
count 29. 

The murders  

Having set out the facts. I seek to draw together the conclusions. I accept the submissions made by 
the prosecution that the following features are present in the cases of murder.  

(i) 

(ii) 

First, there is the obvious fact that he murdered four young men and 
committed other serious offences upon them and upon others; 
 
The murders were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct of the 
defendant surreptitiously drugging these young men so that he could penetrate 
them while they were unconscious; 
  

(iii)  A significant degree of planning went into obtaining the drugs in advance and 

in luring the victims to his flat; 
 

(iv)  Having killed them by administering an overdose, he dragged them out into 
the street in one case, or took them to the churchyard in the other cases, and 
abandoned their bodies in a manner which robbed them of their dignity,  and 
thereby greatly increased the distress of their loving families; 
 

 

8
--------
the defendant removed and disposed of their mobile telephones and planted 
drugs, drug paraphernalia and even the purported suicide note, in an attempt to 
divert suspicion.  

the murders of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were committed while 
the defendant was on bail for the offence of perverting the course of justice 
into the investigation of the death of Anthony Walgate. 

(v) 

 
(vi) 

 

As to mitigation, I accept that his intention was only to cause really serious harm rather than to 
cause death, but he must have known and foreseen that there was a high risk of death, the more so 
after the death of Anthony Wallgate, the first victim and the loss and bereavement felt by the 
victims is none the less because he intended only to cause them some really serious harm.  
  
I also accept that he has no previous convictions for violence, but that counts for little when set 
against the length and scale of his offending. 

The defendant has been convicted of the murders of four young men. Each murder was committed 
in the course of satisfying his lust for penetrating young man whom he had rendered unconscious by 
the surreptitious administration of drugs. Having regard to paragraph 4 of schedule 21 of the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003, I have no doubt that the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally 
high that the whole life order is justified; indeed it is required. 

The sentence therefore upon the counts of murder is a sentence of life imprisonment; I decline to 
set a minimum term; the result is a whole life sentence and the defendant will die in prison. 

The rapes and other sexual offences 

I substantially accept the submission by the prosecution that the rapes and other serious sexual 
offences exhibit the following aggravating features: 

(i) 

(ii) 

 
(iii) 

 
(iv) 

(v) 
 
(vi) 

First, they extended over a period of fully 3½ years; the defendant committed 
four rapes on four different victims, and other very serious sexual offences 
upon other victims, including the four young men who died.  
 
the rapes were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct involving 
the defendant surreptitiously drugging young men so that he could penetrate 
them while they were unconscious; 

the surreptitious use of drugs, whether by way of spiking their drinks or by 
anal insertion, intended to render the victims unconscious was inherently 
dangerous, as the defendant was aware; 

there was a significant degree of planning; 
 
the rape of D was recorded; 

the rape of H, who was vulnerable and who turned to him for help, involved 
an abuse of trust; 
 

I am unable to identify any mitigating features beyond the fact that the defendant has no previous 
convictions, which accounts for little when set against the scale of his offending, as I have already 
said. 

 

9
--------
Self‐evidently, the defendant is highly dangerous; the offences of rape and assault by penetration 
are punishable with discretionary life imprisonment under section 225 of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003. I pass such a sentence on these counts, which in my judgement it is the only appropriate 
sentence to mark the gravity and depravity of these offences. 

The relevant sentencing Guideline indicates sentences of 20 years and more may be appropriate for 
campaigns of rape, such as this was. It is, in my opinion, appropriate to sentence each offence within 
the overall criminality, which requires condign punishment. The appropriate determinate sentence 
on each count of rape and assault by penetration would be 22 years; resulting in a life sentence on 
those counts with a minimum term on these counts of 11 years, less the time that he has spent in 
custody for those offences, which can be worked out administratively, and altered if it later appears 
that some mistake has been made.. 

The maximum sentence for administering a substance with intent is 10 years; this is one of those 
rare cases where the maximum sentence is justified, therefore on those counts I pass a sentence of 
10 years imprisonment. 

I direct that a transcript of these remarked is sent to the Life Imprisonment Unit at the Home Office. 

I am required to say that the statutory surcharge applies.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant was convicted on one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 324 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”), one charge of criminal intimidation under the second limb of s 506 of the PC and one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC. All three charges arose from a single incident of maid abuse that occurred on the evening of 1 November 2001. The appellant was sentenced to a total of four months and two weeks’ imprisonment. She appealed against both conviction and sentence. At the trial, counsel for the appellant sought to address me specifically on the issue of sentence. However, I have, in the interest of completeness, dealt with both the appeals on conviction and sentence. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal on conviction but allowed the appeal on sentence in part. I now give my reasons.
The facts
2          At the material time, the appellant, a widow, lived at No 36 Carrisbrooke Grove with her three young children aged six years, four years and three months. From 12 February 2001 to 2 November 2001, the appellant had employed the victim, Nur Akbariyah (“Nur”), as a domestic maid.
3          On the evening of 1 November 2001, the appellant had allegedly threatened and assaulted Nur at the appellant’s residence, thereby giving rise to the three charges above.
The Prosecution’s case
4          The Prosecution relies primarily on Nur’s testimony. At or around 6.40pm on 1 November 2001, the appellant and Nur were in the kitchen of the appellant’s residence. The appellant was apparently unhappy with Nur because she had neglected to prepare dinner for the children.
5          At this time, the appellant was cooking porridge while nagging Nur. She had repeatedly asked Nur whether Nur “knew what she [the appellant] was doing”. As Nur had noticed that the appellant had prepared carrots and cabbage, and was in the process of cutting potatoes, she replied that the appellant was making soup. This served to further anger the appellant. The appellant ordered Nur to slap herself.
6          However, even after Nur had slapped herself, the appellant remained dissatisfied and proceeded to give Nur a hard slap on the left cheek. Nur then withdrew to the area behind the kitchen where she laid on the floor and cried.
7          Shortly after, the appellant summoned Nur back to the kitchen and demanded to know why she was crying. Nur responded that she was in pain, to which the appellant pushed Nur’s head against the kitchen wall. The appellant then took the kitchen knife that she had been using earlier and placed it against Nur’s chin, at the same time asking Nur in a loud voice, “Can you wake up?” When Nur responded in the affirmative, the appellant proceeded to place the knife on Nur’s chest and stomach area while repeating the same question.
8          Finally, the appellant rested the knife on Nur’s left collarbone and repeated the question. This time, Nur felt some pain in her collarbone area.
9          When the appellant’s tirade had ended, she assumed a conciliatory attitude and persuaded Nur not to cry and to speak to the appellant as a friend. The appellant then instructed Nur to run around the kitchen and to “put on a happy face”. Nur complied with these instructions.
10        At the conclusion of the entire episode, Nur continued with her chores. It was while Nur was preparing the bath for the appellant’s baby that she noticed a small cut on her collarbone. She also noticed that her T-shirt was stained with blood from the cut.
11        At about 11.30am the next morning, Nur took the opportunity to flee from the appellant’s residence while the appellant had gone to fetch her children from kindergarten. Nur proceeded straight to Serangoon Gardens Police Post (“the police post”) and reported the previous evening’s incident. On the same day, Nur was sent for a medical examination at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As a result, the appellant was charged with two counts of causing hurt and one count of criminal intimidation.
12        The trial against the appellant thus proceeded on the following three charges:
(a)        voluntarily causing hurt to Nur by use of a knife (District Arrest Case No 3549 of 2004);
(b)        criminal intimidation of Nur by placing a knife at her neck (District Arrest Case No 3550 of 2004); and
(c)        voluntarily causing hurt to Nur by slapping her and pushing her head against a wall (District Arrest Case No 3551 of 2004).
The defence
13        The appellant denied all the allegations made against her. According to her testimony, on the evening of the alleged incident, Nur had informed the appellant that dinner had not yet been prepared. The appellant then went to the kitchen to prepare porridge, as her chief concern at the time was to prepare a meal for her children.
14        The appellant claimed to be merely “grumbling” as she prepared the meal. When Nur entered the kitchen, the appellant had simply asked why dinner was not yet cooked. Nur had responded by apologising repeatedly whereupon the appellant allegedly said to Nur, “Don’t apologise. You just quietly slap yourself”. The appellant then resumed cooking. Thereafter, the appellant went to breastfeed her baby while Nur fed the other children their dinner. Nothing further transpired that evening.
15        The following morning, the appellant discovered that Nur was missing only after she returned from fetching her children from kindergarten. As she was leaving her house to search for Nur, the appellant’s neighbour informed the appellant that her maid had seen Nur bleeding. The neighbour also related to the appellant that Nur had told the neighbour’s maid that she was going to report the matter to the police.
16        Upon hearing the neighbour’s account of what had occurred, the appellant called the police and was informed that Nur was indeed at the police post and that an ambulance had been called for. The appellant was then instructed to wait at home. The following morning, the police conducted a search of the appellant’s home. Nur was also present at the time and had allegedly said, “Sorry, Madam”, to the appellant.
17        The appellant denied that the threat and assault ever took place at her residence on 1 November 2001.
The decision below
18        Before commencing his evaluation of the evidence before him, the district judge referred to the decision of 
Choy Kok Meng v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 150
, and recognised that the court must exercise extreme caution in examining Nur’s evidence when the primary piece of evidence directly proving the Prosecution’s case came from Nur herself. After scrutinising the evidence in great detail, he concluded that Nur had been earnest and forthright in recollecting the events that transpired on 1 November 2001. While there appeared to be some inconsistencies in her evidence, the district judge ultimately found them to be inconsequential in nature, and found that it was not unusual that Nur could not recollect such details with crystal clarity. He found that Nur had no reason to lie and that her account was credible.
19        In contrast, the district judge found the appellant to be a guarded witness who had, during the course of the trial, slanted her testimony to dissociate herself from adverse evidence. He found certain aspects of the appellant’s version of the facts inherently incredible and observed that there were material discrepancies between the appellant’s testimony and her police statement. He thus held that the Prosecution had successfully impeached the appellant’s credit.
20        The district judge also noted that the Prosecution’s case was supported by the objective medical evidence of Dr Tan Bien Peng (“Dr Tan”). Dr Tan had examined Nur at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at 12.37pm on 2 November 2001 and reported the following injuries:
(a)        a 3cm diameter cephalohematoma over the right parietal region of the head; and
(b)        a 1cm linear scar over the left clavicular region.
The district judge therefore concluded that the Prosecution had proven its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant on all three charges.
21        On the issue of sentence, the district judge considered the various mitigating factors, including the fact that the appellant had no previous antecedents. Hardship and mental stress suffered by the appellant were not deemed by the district judge to amount to valid mitigating factors. He did, however, take into account the fact that the threat had not lasted for a prolonged period and that the wound inflicted by the knife was relatively minor. Having considered the relevant benchmark sentences for the various offences and all the circumstances of the case, the district judge sentenced the appellant to:
(a)        two weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt with a knife;
(b)        four months’ imprisonment for criminal intimidation; and
(c)        two weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt by slapping the victim and pushing her head against a wall.
The sentences for the first two charges were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a total custodial term of four months and two weeks.
The appeal
22        The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence.
The appeal against conviction
23        The appellant’s grounds of appeal centred around the lower court’s findings of fact on the two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and voluntarily causing hurt with a knife. As to the grounds of appeal regarding the third charge of criminal intimidation, the appellant challenged the district judge’s findings of both fact and law.
24        Before delving into each particular charge, I revisited some general principles that an appellate court ought to take cognisance of when invited to scrutinise the findings of a lower court.
General approach in appellate trials
25        It cannot be over-emphasised that an appellate court must be cautious in exercising its powers to overturn a lower court’s finding of fact. This principle applies with equal force in cases where the appellate court has to decide whether the lower court ought to have accepted one party’s version of facts over another: 
Ong Ting Ting v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 156
.
26        An appellate court will therefore only depart from the findings of the trial judge when it has been shown that the lower court had reached a conclusion that is clearly erroneous and unsustainable on the evidence tendered: 
Sahadevan s/o Gundan v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 145
. To this end, due regard must be given to the fact that the trial judge has the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses when arriving at any finding of fact.
27        In the present case, the district judge displayed an awareness of the pitfalls in relying primarily upon the evidence given by Nur to convict the appellant. He traversed the evidence carefully and arrived at the conclusion that Nur was indeed credible while the appellant, by contrast, was unworthy of belief.
28        With the above in mind, I proceeded to evaluate the merits of the appellant’s grounds of appeal.
DAC 3549/2004: voluntarily causing hurt with a knife
29        The main thrust of the appellant’s argument lay in the supposed mistake committed by the district judge when he reconciled the medical evidence with the other oral testimony given during the trial. The appellant relied upon the following part of the district judge’s grounds of decision (see 
[2004] SGDC 147
) at [42] and [43]:
Cut on collarbone region an old scar
 
– As for Dr Tan’s testimony that the cut on Nur’s collarbone region was an old scar and not a fresh wound (para 24(d)), I am of the view that this evidence alone does not discredit her evidence. After all, it is important to note that this wound is relatively minor (no more than 1 cm in size) and that some time had elapsed between the infliction of the injury and Dr Tan’s medical examination. Under the circumstances, it is not inconceivable that Nur’s injury might have healed by the time Dr Tan saw her. According to Dr Tan, the 1-cm scar over Nur’s left collarbone region is consistent with a cut that was small, dried up and which did not require any dressing or treatment.
Furthermore, there is the Accused’s own evidence that very soon after discovering Nur missing on 2 November 2001, one Mrs Huang (a neighbour) informed her that her own maid had seen Nur ‘bleeding’. This is consistent with Nur’s evidence that when she was leaving the Accused’s residence, she had shown her collarbone region injury to another maid from a neighbouring house.
From the above, the appellant contended that the district judge had implicitly accepted that Nur’s wound was still bleeding at the time she had left the house and that this finding was unsupported by the objective medical evidence of Dr Tan. It was also alleged that Nur had contradicted herself when she stated at the trial that the blood on the wound was not totally dry at the time of the medical examination. On this basis, counsel for the appellant urged me to find in favour of the appellant and to hold that the district judge, in deciding that the appellant had indeed inflicted the knife wound on Nur, had reached a conclusion that was unsupported by the evidence.
30        A careful reading of [42] of the grounds of decision makes it abundantly clear that the district judge had never accepted that the wound was bleeding. In fact, he had come to the conclusion that the wound had healed itself by the time Nur was examined by Dr Tan. References in [43] to the conversation with the appellant’s neighbour merely indicated that Nur had indeed shown her wound to the neighbour’s maid and not that the wound was bleeding.
31        A necessary corollary to the above finding would therefore be that Dr Tan’s report supports, rather than contradicts, the Prosecution’s case that the knife wound had been inflicted the day before the medical examination. Implicit in the appellant’s evidence that her neighbour’s maid had seen Nur bleeding on the morning of 2 November 2001 is the assertion that Nur may have sustained the injury in the morning and not the previous night. The district judge’s finding that the wound had dried up by the time Nur saw Dr Tan did not assist the appellant’s case in this respect.
32        As to the appellant’s submission that the district judge had failed to ascribe due consideration to the inherent contradiction between the medical evidence and Nur’s evidence that the blood on the wound was still not dry during Dr Tan’s examination, I was of the view that the apparent contradiction should have little bearing on the appellant’s conviction. It is clear from cases such as 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
 and 
Hon Chi Wan Colman v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 558
, that the court is entitled, for good reasons, to accept one part of a witness’ testimony and to reject the other. On the facts, the district judge had found Nur’s testimony to be credible and materially consistent with the nature of the injuries sustained by her. The apparent inconsistency may have been due to her anxiety over being placed on the witness stand and should not be used to prejudice the credibility of the rest of Nur’s testimony. Furthermore, the medical examination and the presence of blood on the collarbone region of the T-shirt that Nur had worn at the material time provided greater impetus to believe the rest of Nur’s testimony regardless of the alleged inconsistency.
33        In light of the finding that the wound had healed and that it corresponded to what was recorded in the medical report, the assertion that the medical report supported the appellant’s case naturally fell away.
34        Counsel for the appellant also sought to raise the issue that the district judge had erred in relying upon certain evidence that constituted hearsay to corroborate Nur’s version of the facts. These included Nur’s evidence that she had spoken to a nurse about her wound prior to her examination by Dr Tan and the evidence of the appellant’s conversation with her neighbour. As I was satisfied that the appellant’s conviction was founded on sufficient evidence such as the bloodied shirt, Nur’s credible testimony and the objective evidence of Dr Tan, whether those two pieces of evidence constituted hearsay evidence did not impact on the finding of the trial judge and I shall say no more on this matter.
35        The appellant further invited me to draw a negative inference from the fact that the Prosecution had failed to send the knife for deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) testing pursuant to s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) (“EA”). This would have required me to deem the DNA analysis of the knife as unfavourable to the Prosecution’s case by virtue of the Prosecution having failed to produce such an analysis. However, the Prosecution had drawn my attention to the case of 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 475
 where it was decided that an adverse inference was to be drawn under s 116 illustration (g) of the EA only if the Prosecution withheld evidence which it possessed and not merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence.
36        In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 (cited in the recent decision of 
Khua Kian Keong v PP
 
[2003] 4 SLR 526
), in the context of the drawing of a negative inference from the Prosecution’s failure to call certain witnesses, I had stated at [74] and [77]:
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
…
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
37        In the present case, in choosing not to send the knife for DNA analysis, the Prosecution had not withheld any material evidence from the appellant. There was no cause to draw a negative inference. While it may have been true that a DNA analysis of the knife would be relevant and perhaps useful in the determination of the appellant’s guilt, I was of the view that Nur’s testimony, Dr Tan’s medical report and the blood-stained T-shirt were sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt. There was no need to take the additional step of procuring the DNA analysis.
38        In light of the district judge’s finding that Nur was a credible witness, the substantial consistency of Nur’s testimony with the injuries she sustained, the supporting evidence of Dr Tan’s medical report and the blood found on the T‑shirt worn by Nur at the material time, I was of the view that the appellant had failed to show that the district judge came to an erroneous conclusion on the evidence. I found that the district judge was correct in convicting the appellant on the charge of voluntarily causing hurt with a knife.
DAC 3550/2004: criminal intimidation using a knife
39        This aspect of the appeal raised two distinct issues. First, whether the appellant’s utterances and conduct were capable of amounting to criminal intimidation under s 503 of the PC. Second, whether the conviction of the appellant under the 
second limb
 of s 506 of the PC, when the charge was framed under the 
first limb
 of s 506 of the PC, had the effect of rendering the conviction erroneous or merely went towards the determination of the sentence.
The first issue: conviction
40        The appellant disputed the veracity of the district judge’s findings. It was argued that the district judge had placed too great a reliance upon the sole testimony of Nur without considering that the appellant was, at the material time, unable to threaten Nur as she was carrying her baby while making dinner. Furthermore, the appellant alleged that the facts, at best, disclosed that she had moved the knife around as she scolded Nur and that this did not constitute a threat and thus did not assist the Prosecution’s case that she had threatened Nur.
41        It bears repeating that the district judge, upon hearing the evidence in its entirety, had decided that Nur was a credible witness and that the appellant, having had her credibility impeached, was not worthy of belief. He then found that the appellant had placed the knife on Nur’s chin, chest and stomach area while asking her to “wake up” in a “strong tone”. In the absence of the appellant producing any evidence to show that the district judge had erred in reaching the above conclusion, I was of the view that there was no reason to disturb the findings of fact.
42        The district judge then laid down the two-stage test that the Prosecution must satisfy before a conviction can be made out. First, whether the appellant had threatened Nur with injury to her person; and second, whether the threat was intended to cause alarm to her.
43        In ascertaining whether a threat was made, the learned district judge was guided by the case of 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
 where I had stated at [44] and [45]:
For there to be a threat, the words uttered must be such that they would actually cause the victim, and any reasonable man in the victim’s circumstances, to at least comprehend the words as having the 
effect
 of a threat to begin with. Otherwise, such words will not constitute a threat.
To this extent, the existence of a threat will depend on the factual matrix of the case — a threat is not issued merely because threatening words per se are used. Obviously, if the words ‘
I will assault you
’ were uttered when the parties were merry-making and sharing a joke, no threat would have been issued; no one would have comprehended such words as having the effect of a threat. Therefore, all the circumstances of the case have to be considered.
44        To this end, the learned district judge concluded that there was no principle in law that only words (not acts) can amount to threats.
45        The appellant relied upon 
Ratanlal & Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes,
 vol 2 (23rd Ed, 1988) at p 2026 for the proposition that where no words are spoken by the accused, there can be no threat and that the intention of a speaker to threaten the victim can only be gathered from the words uttered. It was therefore submitted that the words “wake up” could not amount to a threat under s 503 of the PC.
46        On the facts, it was clear that the appellant had uttered the words “wake up” to Nur. Furthermore, as already observed in the 
Ameer Akbar
 case, all the circumstances of the case must be considered. I was of the view that just as intimidating phrases when used in a light-hearted context cannot amount to a threat, purportedly light-hearted words may amount to a threat when used under intimidating circumstances. There was nothing in s 503 of the PC that required a threat to be ascertained solely from the words used and not from the surrounding circumstances. A sensible interpretation must be ascribed to the words of s 503 of the PC if we are to prevent persons such as the appellant from eluding justice by using sugar-coated threats.
47        As for the requirement of an intention to cause alarm to the victim, I thought that the conduct of the accused in placing the knife at various parts of Nur’s body, when viewed in conjunction with her repeated use of the phrase “wake up”, would be sufficient to cause alarm to any reasonable person in Nur’s position. I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and that the conviction should be upheld.
The second issue: application of the wrong limb of s 506 PC
48        The appellant submitted that a conviction under the first limb of s 506 of the PC was sufficient. The first limb of s 506 of the PC deals with normal criminal intimidation and carries a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The second limb of s 506 of the PC deals with criminal intimidation to cause death or grievous hurt and carries a maximum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment.
49        The district judge had, in fact, convicted and sentenced the appellant pursuant to the second limb of s 506 of the PC. This was a matter of grave concern because a careful reading of the second charge revealed the particulars of the charge to be the appellant’s act of threatening to 
cause injury
 to the victim with a knife. This brought the charge squarely within the ambit of the first limb of s 506 of the PC.
50        Counsel for the appellant had made no submissions on this point except to urge me to sentence the appellant under the first limb of s 506 of the PC. The Prosecution conceded that the district judge had erred in this respect but had submitted that the lower court’s reliance on the second limb of s 506 of the PC did not occasion a failure of justice as far as the guilt of the appellant was concerned. To this end, the Prosecution relied on the case of 
Lim Chuan Huat v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 105
 where I had decided that where the error in question affects the sentence but not the determination of guilt, s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) may be invoked to allow the High Court to set aside a sentence that is manifestly excessive.
51        I think that the approach laid down in 
Lim Chuan Huat
 is equally applicable in the present case. The district judge readily found the appellant guilty of criminal intimidation by way of threat to cause death or grievous hurt. It is obvious that the appellant can likewise be found guilty of a lesser charge of criminal intimidation by threat to cause injury. The only step that remained was to review the sentence meted out by the district judge. To resort to any other procedure would result in duplicity of effort and a waste of resources.
52        I will deal with the issue of sentence in the later part of my judgment.
DAC 3551/2004: voluntarily causing hurt
53        The appellant submitted that the district judge had placed too much emphasis on Nur’s testimony without sufficient regard to the material discrepancies between her testimony and Dr Tan’s medical report. In addition, counsel for the appellant had submitted that the district judge had placed insufficient emphasis on the concession by Dr Tan in his testimony that there could have been an alternative way in which Nur could have sustained the injury.
54        Again, it was clear from the district judge’s grounds of decision that he found Nur’s testimony to be substantially consistent with her injuries. He noted that Nur had stated in her evidence-in-chief that she had been slapped once on the left check, whereas Dr Tan’s report reflected that Nur had claimed that the appellant had used her palms to slap Nur over both cheeks. Ultimately, the district judge, having expressly taken the discrepancy into account in determining the credibility of Nur’s claims, still found her to be a credible witness.
55        I was persuaded that there arose no instance whereby the district judge had arrived at a finding that was unsupported by the evidence. Both Nur’s testimony and the medical report indicated that Nur was indeed slapped. There was no need to disturb the district judge’s finding in this regard.
56        The fact that Nur had sustained a head injury as a result of the appellant pushing her head against the wall was borne out by Nur’s oral testimony and was further supported by the objective observations of Dr Tan. While the appellant alluded to the fact that Dr Tan had conceded that the head injury sustained by Nur could have occurred through other means, due regard must be had to the case of 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
 at [68] where I had issued the following warning (in the context of the burden of proof on the Prosecution):
It bears repeating that the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. … The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal.
57        The fact that Dr Tan had conceded the possibility of Nur sustaining a head injury by some other means did not take the appellant’s assertion out of the fanciful and into the realm of real or reasonable doubt. The appellant had to show more in order to substantiate her argument. The appellant, in raising this line of reasoning, had plainly failed in this regard.
58        Having reviewed the reasoning of the district judge, it was my view that the Prosecution had yet again succeeded in establishing the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore upheld the conviction.
The appeal against sentencing
General mitigating factors
59        Counsel for the appellant submitted several general mitigating factors that were allegedly in the appellant’s favour. Chief amongst these were the appellant’s lack of antecedent, hardship to the appellant’s family and the inordinate delay of three years in the charging and prosecution of the appellant.
60        With regard to the absence of antecedents on the appellant’s part, the district judge was correct in finding it to be a valid sentencing consideration. However, the Prosecution submitted that the appellant’s lack of antecedents should be, at best, a neutral factor. To this end, reliance was placed on the authority of 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
. However, that case cannot stand for such a proposition. In that case, I had held that the weight ascribed to the fact that the accused was a first time offender would have been greater if there were positive evidence as to character rather than the negative inference from the absence of allegations of other convictions. That, by any reading, cannot be taken to mean that the lack of antecedents on the part of the appellant has no mitigating value whatsoever. It is trite law that the absence of a prior conviction provides some degree of mitigation for an accused person.
61        It has also been clearly established that potential hardship suffered by the appellant’s family plays no role in the determination of sentence. I had already stated in cases such as 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
 and 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
 that hardship caused to the accused’s family when the accused was sent to prison carried little weight generally, and carried no weight at all when the term of imprisonment was short. Taking into consideration the relatively short custodial sentence meted out by the lower court, I found that the appellant’s submission on hardship as a mitigating factor carried no merit whatsoever.
62        On the third and final mitigating factor, the appellant submitted that the case of 
Tan Kiang Kwang v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 280
 supported the practice of granting a “discount” in sentence for the inordinate delay in the prosecution of the appellant’s case. The appellant’s proposition was, however, misconceived. In that case, I had drawn a distinction between situations where the prosecution of the accused had occurred long after the accused had been charged and the converse situation where there was a delay in charging the accused but with no delay in the prosecution thereafter. I had further stated that there was greater mitigating force in the former situation. Hence, based on the present facts, where the prosecution had followed a few months after the appellant was charged, there was no force in the appellant’s argument at all.
63        Before turning to review the specific sentences, I was mindful of some relevant mitigating factors that are indeed in the appellant’s favour. First, as alluded to above, the appellant is a first-time offender; second, the entire episode happened on the spur of the moment and was not premeditated; third, the incident was short-lived; and finally, the injuries sustained were not of a serious nature. These considerations guided me in my assessment of the reasonableness of the sentences.
DAC 3549/2004: voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon
64        In his grounds of decision, the District Judge had made reference to the cases of 
Lai Mei San Lily v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 23 of 1995 (unreported) and 
Ng Peng Kwang v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 338 of 1990 (unreported). Both cases involved instances where the accused had stabbed the victim with a knife. The sentences meted out were one month’s imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane respectively. I was of the view that 
Ng Peng Kwang
 should be distinguished as it involved a case of road rage, hence the impetus to mete out a harsher sentence. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that both cases involved instances of stabbing while, in the present case, the injury was a minor 1cm cut to the collarbone region.
65        As such, taking into account the above precedents, the nature of the injury and also the fact that the present case involves an incident of maid abuse, I found the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment entirely reasonable.
DAC 3550/2004: Criminal Intimidation
66        As I have alluded to in [48] to [52], the district judge had erred in convicting the appellant on the second limb of s 506 of the PC. The appropriate remedy to this problem is to revise the sentence ordered by the district judge.
67        The Prosecution had sought to rely upon the case of 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
 
[2002] 2 SLR 98
 to show that the sentence of four months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive. Further, the Prosecution argued that the case was authority for the proposition that a harsher sentence should be ordered where the accused had used a weapon to intimidate the victim.
68        It is clear from the various cases involving criminal intimidation that the fact that the victim was not only alarmed but also put in fear for his or her safety was an aggravating factor. In addition, past cases have established that the use of a weapon in conjunction with the threat will inevitably lead to a custodial sentence. The above notwithstanding, I was mindful of the fact that the district judge had concluded that the appellant had uttered the threat in a moment of frustration, that the threat was not prolonged and that the appellant had not seriously intended to carry out the threat.
69        Having considered all the above, I decided that the Prosecution was wrong to rely on 
Luan Yuanxin
. In that case, the accused had brandished a meat cleaver while threatening to kill the victim. The facts there, as they were borne out, justified a conviction and sentence under the second limb of s 506 of the PC.
70        As the present conviction ought to have come under the ambit of the first limb of s 506 of the PC, I found the case of 
PP v Tan Beng Hoe
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 123 of 2002 (unreported) relevant in determining the appropriate sentence. In that case, the accused was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for pointing a chopper at the victim while pinning her to a wall. I accordingly allowed the appellant’s appeal against sentence with respect to the charge of criminal intimidation and reduced it to two months’ imprisonment.
DAC 3551/2004: voluntarily causing hurt
71        The appellant cited several cases to support the proposition that a fine would be a sufficient sentence. Those cases, however, did not involve instances of maid abuse. Previous cases have clearly stated that the courts should be ready to impose a custodial sentence in maid abuse cases to reflect the public policy of discouraging the ill treatment of foreign labour. In light of the tone I have set in such cases, it was reasonable for the district judge to have ordered a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment.
Conclusion
72        For the reasons above, I dismissed the appeal against conviction and upheld the sentence in part, with the sentence for DAC 3550/2004 to be reduced from four months’ to two months’ imprisonment.

20,2767076,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sribounheuang [2015] NSWSC 901,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 3 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1) of the Act that certain funds be transferred to an account held by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all interest of the defendant in the property specified in Schedule One; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff, within 21 days, a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendant’s illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 3 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	



	
	Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015; and
	
	
	Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 3 July 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).
	



	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA). These are serious criminal offences within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the DMTA are “drug trafficking offences”. The Facts Sheet records that the defendant was charged with the offences described therein on 2 July 2015 following the execution of search warrants at premises at Blair Athol, New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He deposed to a conversation he had with Detective Christopher Eisenhuth, who had prepared the Facts Sheet on the basis of information provided by investigating police officers. Detective Eisenhuth informed Mr Spark that the facts set out are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he caused to be made into the defendant’s bank accounts.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with funds can be concealed or disposed of, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

21,2708726,Tattersall v R [2011] NSWCCA 282,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of detaining Steven Jiminez without his consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely psychological, and at the time of detaining, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Jiminez. The offence was contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty being 25 years imprisonment.  2The sentencing judge was also required to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of deem supply of a prohibited drug, being 5.3 grams of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 (NSW).  3The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 14 years and 5 months comprising a non-parole period of 11 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 5 months. There are two grounds of appeal being:  Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in having regard to material that was not in evidence before him.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive.  4The facts were not in dispute and are as follows:  5The co-offender Nadia Donn befriended a woman called Amanda Sutton in 2006. Both had interests in common and through those interests met the applicant. Sutton became involved in a relationship with the applicant and they moved into a house together. The victim in this matter is Stephen Jimenez. At about this time he was living in Nowra and befriended the co-offenders being Ben Thomas and his girlfriend Nadia Donn. Donn and Thomas introduced Jimenez to Sutton and the applicant. Jimenez eventually moved to Warilla, a suburb of Wollongong.  6Shortly thereafter the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. Donn spent a lot of time with Sutton whilst the applicant was in custody. She encouraged Sutton to take up with Jimenez and before long Sutton and Jimenez developed a casual sexual relationship. The applicant was released from custody on 20 February 2010 and stayed in a caravan in his brother's backyard in Nowra. At this time Donn fell out with Sutton and told the applicant's brother about Sutton's sexual relationship with Stephen Jimenez. She expected that information to get back to the applicant.  7At about 9pm on Monday 22 February 2010 the applicant arrived at Donn's house. The applicant asked Thomas if he had been ""rooting Sutton"". Donn said ""No it was junior, Stephen (being the victim) and Dwayne"". The applicant directed Donn and Thomas to attend his caravan. When they got there the applicant took Jimenez's number from Donn's phone. The applicant called the number. Donn and Thomas heard the applicant talking to someone on the phone and becoming very agitated. He appeared to be speaking to someone called Rob. At the time the victim Jimenez was visiting Rob Menz at William Avenue, Warilla. At about 9.30pm Jimenez's mobile phone rang. Menz picked it up and answered. He heard a male voice ask ""Where's Amanda?"" Menz replied ""Hang on buddy, this is not Stephen, I just answered his phone"". The male then said ""I'm looking for Amanda. Is Stephen with Amanda? I just got out of gaol, I don't even have any clothes, I want to know where my things are"". Menz replied ""No they haven't been together since new year"". The male asked ""Where is he?"" Menz replied ""Dunno"".  8The phone rang again and was answered this time by Jimenez. The male asked ""Where are you?"" Jimenez replied ""In Fairy Meadow"". The male said:  ""Were you with my missus cunt? I'm coming to get you. You're not at Fairy Meadow are you cunt, you're at William Street aren't you cunt. Stay put I'm coming to get you cunt. I'll be there in twenty minutes, I'm leaving now"".  9The applicant then directed Donn and Thomas to pick up Jimenez. They were joined by another co-offender Shaun Burne. Donn drove the three of them back to her house where they changed cars and then Thomas drove them to William Avenue, Warilla in his Mitsubishi Magna station wagon. In the meantime Jimenez drove to Warilla Police Station to report the applicant's threat. H e returned to Menz's home in William Avenue. While he was there he received a call from a male calling himself ""Jason."" The male said he would be at the house in twenty minutes. Jimenez went and sat in his car so that he could drive to the police station if need be. He waited for an hour and then phoned Donn. The male who called himself ""Jason"" answered the phone. He confirmed that they were on their way and said ""You want to be there cunt"".  10Shortly thereafter Jimenez heard a car pull up in the street. He saw Donn and Thomas sitting in Thomas's Magna station wagon. He also saw another male in the back seat of the car. Donn and Thomas saw him and yelled out ""Are you coming or what?"" Jimenez replied, ""I don't know, who is that?"" Burne replied, ""I'm Shaun, Jason's cousin. Are you going to get in the car? The longer you keep Jason waiting the shiftier he gets.""  11Jimenez then agreed to follow them in his red Daihatsu Charade. They travelled in convoy to Albion Park. At one point Jimenez phoned Donn to ask where they were going. Thomas answered the phone and told him ""Jason is already at a house and he's waiting for us. We are driving there"". Jimenez said ""I want to meet in a public place"". Thomas replied ""We can't do that, it will make him more shitty. You are better off just going there"".  12When they arrived at Albion Park both cars stopped and Burne got into Jimenez's car. They then drove to the home of the co-offender Matthew Bool and Stephanie Ireland at 5 Murragan Street, Albion Park Rail. The applicant had earlier phoned Bool to tell him that he was coming over to his house with a couple of his mates. He turned up on his motorbike at about midnight. Once inside he told Bool and Ireland, ""I've got something to do. We got to go fucking sort this fellow out"".  13The others arrived a short time later. They were met by the applicant who said to Jimenez ""Get in here now cunt"". Jimenez walked into the house. He was followed closely by Thomas, Donn and Burne. The applicant punched him in the head as he walked past. Jimenez was then told to stand in the kitchen area and was then punched causing him to fall to the floor. He was then punched and kicked by the applicant as Thomas, Donn and Burne sat around the kitchen area watching. At some point the applicant told Thomas to get a baseball bat from the car. Thomas left and then returned with a baseball bat. The applicant started to hit Jimenez with the baseball bat and then he continued to hit and kick the victim whilst the others watched.  14At one point Jimenez heard something crack in his left ankle and felt a burst of intense pain in his left leg. He screamed and was told by the applicant to ""Shut the fuck up, you're going to wake up the kids"". There were five children in the house aged two, four, six, ten and eleven. They were sleeping in the back bedroom. Ireland checked on the children about eight or nine times during the night, otherwise she remained with the others.  15A little while later the applicant told Jimenez to get up and go out to the backyard. Jimenez picked himself up from the kitchen floor and limped out to the backyard. Once outside the applicant screamed at Jimenez, ""Have you learnt your lesson cunt. I'm going to overdose you on heroin and leave you to die cunt"". The applicant started hitting him with a baseball bat again. Jimenez fell to the ground. After a time the applicant said, ""That's what a dirty cunt gets"".  16At this point the offender Shaun Burne said ""It's my turn now, it's my turn now"". The applicant made Jimenez stand up. Burne then punched Jimenez about five times and then kicked him in the ribs. Jimenez fell to the ground again. Burne then said, ""Get back inside you dumb little cunt"". Back inside the house the applicant asked Bool to get his tattoo gun so that he could write ""dog"" on Jimenez's forehead. Ireland got the tattoo gun and gave it to Bool who in turn set it up and gave it to the applicant. Jimenez was made to lie on the kitchen floor as the applicant used his right hand to tattoo the word ""dog"" on his forehead. He took about ten minutes. Burne was standing nearby. Donn, Thomas and Bool were sitting nearby.  17When the applicant was finished tattooing Jimenez's forehead he and Burne again hit Jimenez. Donn was sitting nearby looking at a tattoo book. The applicant made a number of telephone calls to Robert Menz during the early hours of that morning. During the calls Menz could hear Jimenez getting ""flogged"". At one point the applicant said, ""Your mate's having fun here, you're next, this is going to happen to you"". Jimenez was also forced to sign over ownership of his Daihatsu Charade to the applicant. The document to be signed was prepared by Donn. Thomas drove the vehicle away from the scene in an attempt to conceal it.  18Jimenez was then taken out to the backyard in the early hours of the morning. Bool directed him to sit on a chair in the carport. The applicant asked him, ""What are you meant to say now cunt?"" Jimenez replied, ""Thank you for stopping and I'm sorry for what I've done"". Some time later the applicant said to Jimenez:  ""Ben and Nadia are going to take you to a Sydney hospital. This is what you are going to say. You got bashed by five or six wogs in a park and that you signed your car over to a friend earlier today and Ben and Nadia found you in a park. I will kill you and come after your family if you tell the cops"".  19At about 7.30am Donn and Thomas drove Jimenez to Wollongong Hospital in Thomas' car. With his significant injuries Jimenez had difficulty walking so Donn and Thomas helped him into the hospital and left him with the triage nurse. They then drove to Campbelltown trying to find the address of the person referred to as ""junior"" for the applicant. The applicant left about twenty minutes after Thomas and Donn. He phoned Bool some time later and told him to get rid of the tattoo gun. Ireland took the tattoo gun and put it into a friend's garbage bin.  20At about 11am Donn and Thomas stopped at 5 Murragan Street on their way back from Campbelltown and picked up the baseball bat. They were joined by Bool and Burne. They then went to the place where Thomas had concealed Jimenez's Daihatsu Charade. Thomas drove the Charade to Kiama bends lookout where he dumped it and was then picked up by Donn, Bool and Burne and driven home to Nowra.  21Jimenez was examined at Wollongong Hospital. He had a painful left ankle, left forearm and right elbow. X-rays revealed a fractured left ankle. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left ankle on 26 February 2010 and it was put into a back slab. The injury was consistent with a direct blow to the ankle and surgery was required. He also had the word ""dog"" tattooed on his forehead in green ink.  22Dr Angelo Tsirbas, an ocular plastic surgeon reported that the victim has a severe disability in the vision of his left eye so as to be classed as legally blind in that eye.  23The sentencing judge described the factual circumstances as demonstrating ""the sickening nature of the offence."" His Honour was satisfied that the offender organised for several of his co-offenders to bring the victim to the premises in Murragan Street. Once inside the victim who was 18 years of age was outnumbered and vulnerable. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender then subjected the victim to a brutal bashing that commenced shortly after midnight and did not end until he was taken to the hospital at 7.30 am. Part of the brutality included a threat by the offender that he would be overdosed and left to die. The offender threatened the victim indicating that he and his family would be killed if he spoke to the police. The sentencing judge found that the offence was aggravated by a number of factors including the actual use of a weapon (the baseball bat) and that gratuitous cruelty was involved. His Honour also regarded the use of the tattoo gun as an aggravating feature. His Honour was satisfied that the victim suffered substantial injury and emotional harm well in excess of the actual bodily harm which his Honour described as an element of the offence. His Honour said:  ""During the period of about 7 hours, so completely broken was the spirit of the victim, that he ultimately told the offender what he believed the offender wanted to hear.""  24His Honour was also satisfied that:  ""Callous and calculating nature of the offending conduct was further demonstrated in the act of the offender telephoning Robert Menz, the victim's friend, so he could hear the screams of the victim in the background and threatening Menz this was going to happen to him.""  25His Honour found that the applicant was the ring leader of the criminal enterprise and that his co-offenders were in fear of him and concerned for their own safety if they opposed the applicant's actions. His Honour concluded that the case fell just outside the worst category of offence of its kind, but, mindful of the fact that the applicant had ordered his co-offenders to take the victim to hospital ultimately concluded that the offence ""falls towards the very high end of the range but just short of worst case category.""  26The applicant was aged 35 at the time of sentencing. He has a criminal record for a variety of offences including common assault, custody of a knife in a public place, contravening an apprehended violence order and driving whilst disqualified. He has on previous occasions breached his parole conditions. Following his previous incarceration he was released from custody on 20 February 2010. The offences the subject of the present proceedings were committed 2 days later.  27The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant's conduct ""displayed a viciousness and callousness not often seen."" His Honour said that ""when giving evidence I did not detect any feeling of sympathy for the victim's suffering during the offence or indeed empathy for the continuing psychological damage the victim would experience in the future."" His Honour concluded that he was unable to make a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation nor that he would be unlikely to re-offend.  28The applicant pleaded guilty and although the plea was entered at a relatively late stage his Honour allowed a discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of the plea. His Honour was not persuaded that there were special circumstances.  Ground 1: To that extent the trial judge's summary of the defence case was also inadequate.  29Under this ground of appeal the applicant challenges the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant was the ring leader and that his co-offenders were afraid for their own safety. It was submitted that the evidence could not support these findings and furthermore that the propositions were not put to the applicant during the course of his cross examination. It was submitted that accordingly his Honour erred in having regard to these matters in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.  30The sentencing judge was also responsible for sentencing the applicant's co-offenders. In the remarks on sentence for those offenders his Honour indicated that he was satisfied that each of the co-offenders had been afraid of the applicant at the time of the offence. It is apparent from the transcript of the hearing in relation to the applicant that when he gave evidence he was asked questions by his own counsel in which he acknowledged that he knew from the Crown case statement and from the material that his co-offenders tendered in their own proceedings, that the other offenders had said they were fearful of the applicant at the time Mr Jiminez was detained. In the course of submissions in this Court the applicant's counsel acknowledged that his Honour had sentenced the other offenders and was accordingly familiar with the circumstances of the offence. It was implicit if not expressed that counsel acknowledged that his Honour could have regard to his findings in the other proceedings when sentencing the applicant. Counsel acknowledged that he could not submit that the applicant should be sentenced at the level of the other offenders indicating ""that's clearly not an available submission, his role is significantly greater than that of the others who have been previously sentenced."" Counsel also acknowledged that his client had ""an extensive criminal history, extending over many years.""  31In these circumstances I am satisfied it was plain to the applicant's counsel that after having regard to all of the evidentiary material which counsel acknowledged was available to the sentencing judge his Honour would find that the applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise and that the co-offenders had participated because of threats made against them by the applicant. I am not satisfied that his Honour erred and would reject ground 1 of the appeal.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive  32There can be no doubt that the applicant committed a very serious offence. The victim was seriously injured in the course of the events and has been left legally blind in his left eye. He was brutally bashed with a baseball bat and detained for more than 7 hours. Apart from the physical injuries he was threatened with death. Death threats were also made against his family if the matter was reported to the police.  33Apart from the other substantial physical injuries and emotional harm the applicant inflicted a large tattoo of the word ""dog"" on the victim's forehead. The applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise.  34The applicant said he committed the offence because he had felt ""a bit upset"" when he learned of the sexual relationship between his former partner and the victim. He also said that he was ""off his head"" on drugs or alcohol at the time. To my mind neither of these matters justified or ameliorated the seriousness of the offence. Apart from the primary offence his Honour also had to have regard to the matter on the Form 1. The offence was committed within 2 days of the applicant being released from custody having previously breached his parole. His objective circumstances include a criminal history which demonstrate persistent disregard for the law. The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant would not re-offend.  35In all of these circumstances I am not persuaded that the sentence which his Honour imposed was erroneously excessive.  36In the result I am of the opinion that the applicant's application was entirely without merit. I would refuse leave to appeal.  37LATHAM J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  38HARRISON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  **********

Background
The two appellants were both former police officers, attached to Ang Mo Kio police station. The first appellant (`Garmaz`) retired on 16 April 1993 while the second appellant (`Jaswinder`) resigned on 11 December 1993. Jaswinder was originally charged under s 29(a) read with s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`PCA`) with abetting Garmaz in committing the offence of corruptly accepting a gratification of $2,000 on or about 6 July 1991, by intentionally arranging with one Barlly Tan Kim Hock (`Tan`) (PW1) to give the money to Garmaz through one Leong Kin Eng (`Leong`) (PW5). Garmaz was originally charged under s 6(a) of the PCA with having corruptly accepted from Tan, through Leong, a gratification of $2,000 as an inducement to recommend that no further action be taken on a case against Leong. Leong, who was also known as Christopher Leong, was then under investigation by Garmaz for an alleged offence of illegal moneylending and vandalism. A total of seven other charges were stood down by the prosecution. The appellants did not object to being tried jointly on the above two charges.
 The case for the prosecution
 
 
 
 (i) Barlly Tan`s evidence
 
Tan (PW1) gave evidence that he was asked by one Ang Chee Soon (`Ang`) (PW4) to help out one Ong Thian Lye (`Ong`), who had been arrested for suspected illegal moneylending on 4 July 1991. Tan knew Jaswinder, and made an appointment to meet him at the Blue Berry Lounge in Upper Thomson Road. According to Tan, five persons met at the Lounge - Jaswinder, Garmaz, Ang, Leong and Tan himself. Tan could not confirm when they met. After meeting, they went to the Green Lounge at United Square.
Tan testified that Jaswinder then called him one or two days later and asked whether Tan could help him borrow $2,000. Tan said he would try to help him but he did not. He claimed that he himself did not lend Jaswinder any money. This portion of his evidence contradicted para 15 of his statement which was recorded by SSI Sng Jin Poh (PW3). Paragraph 15 reads: 
 
On the second day, Jaswinder Singh paged for me. When I contacted him, he told me that he wanted to borrow $2,000 friendly loan from me. As I have mentioned, I treated Jaswinder Singh as my friend, therefore, I agreed to lend him the money. I then asked my worker Christopher to arrange with Jaswinder Singh for handing the $2,000 requested by Jaswinder Singh. Similarly, I did not know how Christopher Leong got the $2,000 - but he had been collecting debts for me, I presume he could have taken the money from the debts collected by him. As far as I remember, Jaswinder Singh has not repaid me his loan. I have not pressed him to repay me the loan since he is my friend. It is not important to me whether he will repay me the loan.
 
 
 
The DPP thus applied to treat Tan as a hostile witness. The court went on to admit Tan`s statement. No further material evidence was received from Tan. The district judge eventually ruled at the close of the prosecution`s case that Tan`s credit had been impeached.
 (ii) Ang`s evidence
Ang`s evidence is not really material. Consistent with Tan`s evidence, Ang said that he had asked for assistance in relation to Ong Thian Lye`s arrest. Ang also said that the meeting at the Blue Berry Lounge took place on 5 July 1991.
 (iii) Leong`s evidence
Leong was the main prosecution witness. Leong had been working for Tan since 1989. Tan was an illegal moneylender. Leong testified that he had been arrested and interrogated on 25 September 1990 in relation to a complaint of vandalism and illegal moneylending made by one Oh Kian Tiong. After rigorous interrogation, Jaswinder approached him and told him not to worry as they would know what to do. Jaswinder told him that his boss`s name should not be mentioned and that Garmaz was the Investigating Officer. Leong was later released on bail and was never charged with any offence.
Leong said that on 5 July 1991, he went to the Blue Berry Lounge upon Tan`s instructions. Leong confirmed that the five persons mentioned by Tan were all present there. Later they adjourned to another lounge. On 6 July 1991, Tan informed Leong to prepare $2,000 to be handed over to Jaswinder. Leong arranged to meet Jaswinder at the Blue Berry Lounge that night at about 8pm. Garmaz turned up instead. Leong was not prepared to hand the money to Garmaz, but agreed to do so after speaking to Jaswinder over the telephone. Garmaz suggested that, as there were too many people around, the transaction should be carried out at Yishun Seafood Restaurant. Upon arriving at Yishun Seafood Restaurant at about 9pm, Leong saw both Garmaz and Jaswinder there. He handed the money to Garmaz, who counted the money and put it in his shirt pocket. Garmaz then told him that his case had been `NOD`, an acronym meaning `no offence disclosed`. Leong understood this to mean that there would be no problem with his 1990 case in court.
In cross-examination, Leong said that he had never known about the $2,000 `settlement`. It was only on 6 July 1991 that Tan had asked him to bring $2,000 to see the two appellants. Only after the money had been paid did Leong know that his case had been finally settled. He said that his recollection of the date was based on the fact that on 4 July 1991, another colleague (Ong Thian Lye) was arrested in Sin Ming. Tan told him about this incident, and the following day (5 July 1991) he met the appellants at the Blue Berry Lounge. Leong was very sure that the money was handed over to the appellants on 6 July 1991.
 (iv) The evidence of R Vidhysagaran (`Ringo`) (PW6)
One of the arresting officers when both Leong and Ong were arrested in 1990 and 1991 respectively was Detective Station Inspector R Vidhysagaran, otherwise known as `Ringo`. Ringo gave evidence that he arrested Ong Thian Lye on 4 July 1991. The arrest report in respect of Ong Thian Lye filed by one Pang Ai Jee was produced.
Ringo said that on 9 July 1991, he was at the Green Lounge at United Square, having drinks with some colleagues. He happened to see Jaswinder who was standing with a male Chinese, who was introduced to him as Barlly (Tan). Ringo declined their invitation to join them for a drink. He saw Garmaz as well. He had not met both the appellants on any other occasion at the Green lounge. He wrote in his pocket book the date he was at the Green Lounge.
In cross-examination, Ringo confirmed that he had seen the appellants and Barlly on 9 July 1991. He could not say whether Leong was there.
 (v) The other evidence adduced by the prosecution
The prosecution also called Lee Nai Kong (`Lee`) (PW7), who was then Head Investigation, Ang Mo Kio police station. Lee produced the station duty rosters for September 1990 and July 1991. On 5 July 1991, both appellants were on 24-hour duty, which began at 6am on 5 July and ended at 6am the next day. The minute sheets relating to Leong`s case were produced. They showed that at the end of investigation, no further action was taken against Leong and the investigation papers were sent for filing. Lee identified the officer who wrote NFA (`No Further Action`) and CFF (`Case for Filing`) in the minutes as Chief Inspector II Rosli Magnus. These instructions were given upon Garmaz`s written recommendation.
The last witness for the prosecution was Rosli Magnus (`Rosli`) (PW8). Rosli was attached to Ang Mo Kio police station in 1991 as senior investigating officer. The investigation papers in respect of Leong were produced and Rosli was referred to the minutes recorded. He confirmed that he eventually accepted Garmaz`s recommendation that no further action be taken against Leong.
 (vi) The application to amend the charges
Before Rosli`s evidence was heard, the prosecution applied to amend the charges. The amended charges were tendered for consideration and submissions were heard only after Rosli`s evidence had been recorded. The proposed amendments would add an alternative charge against each appellant. The only difference from the original charges was that the alternative charges specified that the offence took place on 10 July 1991 and not 6 July 1991. The prosecution evidently felt that this was necessary because of the different dates cited by Leong and Ringo as to when the offence had taken place.
Counsel then acting for the appellants objected to the prosecution`s application. Counsel argued that the prosecution was not entitled to tailor the charge to suit the evidence, when the prosecution`s own evidence as to the dates was contradictory. The defence was prejudiced as they had relied on an effective `alibi`. The prosecution contended that the discrepancy was not material, but rather one which could have arisen as a result of inaccurate recollection of dates from Leong, Tan and Ang. As for the contentions of alibi, the prosecution pointed out that no notice of alibi had been given.
The district judge allowed the prosecution`s application. The amended charges were read to the appellants, who claimed trial.
 Submission of no case to answer
Counsel for the appellants sought to argue that there was no case to answer. He pointed out that Tan`s credit had been impeached. Leong`s credibility was doubtful. Moreover, it was only after Ringo gave evidence that the prosecution realised that alternate charges were necessary. There could only be one act of corruption which must have taken place on only one date. It was not open to the prosecution to frame the charge in the alternative.
In reply, the prosecution pointed out that Tan`s credit was impeached only on the question of the loan of $2,000. The remainder of Tan`s evidence stood, at least up to the point where he began to retract the evidence in his statement regarding the $2,000. The date of the meeting was not vitally significant. The point was that there was sufficient evidence to show that Leong gave the $2,000 to Garmaz on either 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991.
The district judge ruled that a prima facie case had been made out, and proceeded to call for the defence of both appellants.
 The defence
 
 
 
 (i) Jaswinder`s defence
 
Jaswinder gave evidence first. He had known Tan for some 20 years. He had known Leong since 1989. Leong had approached him for assistance with his debts to illegal moneylenders. He said he was not in any financial position to assist. He frequented Blue Berry Lounge from 1990 to 1991. He knew that Leong went there as well. He did not know that Leong was working for Tan.
Jaswinder confirmed that he was on 24-hour duty on 5 July 1991, making reference to his pocket diary. He went to Yishun at 2320 hours on 5 July 1991 to investigate a report of fighting at a coffee shop. An incident report, prepared by the operations room personnel, was produced. As such, he could not have been at the Green Lounge on 5 July 1991. He also denied the allegation that $2,000 was handed to him at Yishun. He did not meet Leong and Garmaz there as there was no such incident.
Jaswinder said that he could remember being at the Blue Berry Lounge together with Garmaz, Tan, Leong and Ang. He could not remember the date. He remembered adjourning for more drinks at the Green lounge, where he met Ringo. He had met Ringo a few times there. Jaswinder said that there was `nothing special` about that night when he went out drinking with the others. According to him, it was `a very normal night`.
Jaswinder suggested that Leong might have intended to incriminate him because he had asked for a loan from him and was rejected. He said that his pocket diary showed that on 6 July 1991, he left the police station at 2pm, arrived home at 2.30pm and stayed at home the whole day. It was not possible for Leong to call him at the station to make arrangements to hand over the $2,000. On 9 July 1991, he was at home the whole night. On 10 July 1991, he was at the police station until 6pm when he left for home. He was at home the whole night. He produced a s 122(6) statement which was primarily exculpatory.
In cross-examination, Jaswinder confirmed that in 1993 he had pleaded guilty before the Police Disciplinary Board to a charge of engaging in other employment without the permission of the Commissioner of Police. He explained that this was a plea of convenience as he was about to retire.
 ii Garmaz`s evidence
 
 
Garmaz testified that he recommended `NFA` in respect of Leong`s case as he had genuinely believed that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The final decision rested with Rosli. He disagreed that he had shown any favour to Leong. In the course of his investigation he did not get to see Leong. He had no part in recording Leong`s statement. He did not see Leong after he commenced investigations. He had never suggested to Leong or anyone else that he could dispose of the case for $2,000.
Garmaz said that the Green Lounge was an informal meeting place for Ang Mo Kio police officers. Jaswinder had never suggested to pay him $2,000 in order to settle Leong`s case. He could recall one evening when Tan, Leong, Ang, Jaswinder and himself were drinking at the Blue Berry Lounge. There was no discussion about paying $2,000 to settle the case. Garmaz said that on 6 July 1991, he should be sleeping at home after his 24-hour duty. He could not remember where he was on 10 July 1991. Like Jaswinder, Garmaz tendered his s 122(6) statement which was again a denial of involvement.
In cross-examination, Garmaz said that he had given one month`s notice of his resignation on 22 January 1993 but that had been rejected, as there was a disciplinary matter pending. He confirmed that he had appeared before a Police Disciplinary Board on 28 June 1993 and had pleaded guilty to a charge of moonlighting.
 The district judge`s decision
The district judge found that the prosecution case hinged primarily on Leong`s evidence. He accepted that Leong`s testimony was credible, except that he chose to accept Ringo`s evidence that the offence had taken place on 10 July 1991 and not 6 July 1991 as asserted by Leong. The district judge thus found both the appellants guilty and convicted them on the alternative charges. They were each sentenced to six months` imprisonment.
 The appeal
(i) The elements of the charges
The first argument raised by counsel for the appellants was that the prosecution had failed to establish key elements in the charges. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence as adduced by the prosecution showed that Jaswinder was the ultimate recipient of the $2,000, and not Garmaz. Accordingly, counsel submitted that the charges were not supported by the evidence, since Garmaz was named as the principal offender, with Jaswinder merely fulfilling the role of the abettor.
In my opinion, there was no merit in this submission. Whatever the intricacies of the arrangement may have been, the evidence adduced through Leong did show the receipt of $2,000 by Garmaz. The prosecution alleged that Jaswinder had promised to `process` Leong`s case, in expectation of some future gratification. The actual payment of the gratification eventually materialised after the arrangement was made in July 1991 for Leong to hand over the $2,000. According to Leong, before the payment was made, he was asked by Tan to speak to Jaswinder to arrange for a meeting. After the payment was made, Garmaz told him that his case had been `NOD`. The evidence was sufficient to enable a causal link to be drawn between the `favour` shown to Leong in 1990 and the payment of $2,000 in 1991. Having regard to the surrounding circumstances, there was a corrupt element involved in the transaction. The presumption of `corruption` in s 8 PCA was properly invoked.
 (ii) The finding of abetment by conspiracy
P2A (the charge against Jaswinder) avers that Jaswinder had abetted Garmaz in the corrupt acceptance of $2,000 by `intentionally arranging` with Tan to give Garmaz the $2,000 through Leong. Jaswinder was thus charged with having committed an offence punishable under s 27(a) (now s 29(a)) read with s 6(a) of the PCA. The district judge went on to find that there was a conspiracy between Garmaz and Jaswinder to satisfy the averment of abetment. This was founded on Leong`s evidence as to what had taken place after his interrogation on 25 September 1990 and the events surrounding the payment of $2,000 to Garmaz which, according to Leong, took place on 6 July 1991.
Counsel submitted that the district judge had misdirected himself by finding that the element of conspiracy had been proved, when the charge preferred against Jaswinder did not aver to any abetment by conspiracy. Section 107 of the Penal Code states that abetment may comprise either instigation, conspiracy, or intentionally aiding. From the words used in the charge, counsel surmised that the case for the prosecution was that Jaswinder had intentionally aided Garmaz in obtaining the $2,000. Counsel suggested that the charge referred incorrectly to s 29 PCA, as an offence under the PCA committed pursuant to a conspiracy was properly covered by s 31 of the PCA instead.
Examining s 29 PCA, it is clear that the meaning of `abetment` within the meaning of the Penal Code applies in relation to the abetment of the commission of an offence under the PCA. The offence of abetment as defined in s 107 Penal Code has an inclusive definition which encompasses an act of conspiracy. There was no real quarrel with the use of the phrase `intentionally arranging` in the charge; it was sufficiently clear for the defence to meet the prosecution case. In my view, there is no useful distinction to be drawn between the district judge`s finding of `conspiracy` and the prosecution`s choice of the phrase `intentionally arranging`. In substance, they mean that Jaswinder had abetted Garmaz in the commission of the offence. It was open to the district judge to say that he was satisfied that there was a conspiracy disclosed on the evidence. While the charge could have specifically averred to abetment by either `conspiracy` or `intentional aiding`, there is no material omission or defect in the charge.
 (ii) Tan`s evidence
Counsel next submitted that the district judge should not have disregarded Tan`s evidence as contained in his statement. The district judge had accepted Tan`s evidence that Jaswinder had called him and asked for a loan of $2,000. Counsel suggested that, notwithstanding that Tan`s credit had been impeached, the district judge should have examined the contents of Tan`s statement and considered whether para 15 of the statement could be admitted as substantive evidence. This submission was based mainly on the dicta of the Court of Appeal in (at p 229). Counsel suggested that s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`) could be used to admit para 15 of Tan`s previous statement in evidence.
From my perusal of the respective petitions of appeal, it is not clear that the above ground has been raised at all. In any case, I am not persuaded that it merits any real concern. In a recent decision of the Court of Appeal, 
 Foong Seow Ngiu & 
 O, the position hinted at in 
 Ukthunthod 
 was clarified. Section 147(3) EA could be used to admit the previous inconsistent statement of a witness. Had the district judge done so, Tan would have become the primary witness for the prosecution, and not Leong. The effect would be that the prosecution case would have been fraught with difficulty, since Tan and Leong would have been asserting different reasons for the payment of the $2,000. It was precisely for this reason that the prosecution sought to impeach Tan`s credit. The district judge agreed that Tan`s credit was impeached, at least as far as his evidence revealed inconsistencies.
There is no argument that the district judge was entitled to disregard the whole of Tan`s testimony, applying the settled principles of impeachment. The mere fact that his credit had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence would be disregarded. The court would still have to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine what was true and which aspects should be disregarded. These principles were stated in , at p 148. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, no arguments on these principles having been raised ().
It is apparent then, that it is well within the province of a trial judge to decide which aspects of the evidence merited consideration, having regard to the entirety of the witness`s testimony, and also, where appropriate, to the case sought to be presented by the party which called him to give evidence. In the present case, this was exactly what the district judge did. No specific reason was suggested by counsel as to why the district judge should have accepted para 15 of the statement as representing the truth of the matter. On the other hand, the district judge explained that he accepted the relevant portions of Tan`s evidence because Leong and Ang had given substantially the same evidence. I see no reason why he was not entitled to proceed on this basis.
Counsel for the appellants went so far as to contend that an offence was only disclosed on the evidence if para 15 of Tan`s statement was taken together with Leong`s evidence. Only then could it be seen that the actual scheme was for Jaswinder to use Garmaz to obtain gratification which was primarily intended for Jaswinder himself. As intimated earlier, I would respectfully disagree. It was not necessary for the prosecution to pitch their case at that level. They were not under any duty to unravel all the potential underlying complexities within the corrupt transaction.
 (iv) Framing the charges in the alternative
Counsel for the appellants contended that the district judge had prejudiced the appellants in preferring charges in the alternative. The only provision within the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) which deals with when an accused person may be `charged in the alternative` is s 172, which reads: 
 
If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of those offences and any number of the charges may be tried at once or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the those offences.
 
 
 
The two illustrations to s 172 suggest that the section is really intended to cover situations where it is unclear precisely what offence has been committed. The marginal note confirms this. The key is to examine whether the `single act` or `series of acts` is of `such a nature` as to be capable of being characterised differently as one or more of `several offences`.
In the present case, the prosecution`s decision to amend the charges and frame charges in the alternative against the appellants clearly did not fall within what s 172 CPC envisages. It was not as if the act of corruption alleged was of `such a nature` as to give rise to variable characterisations as several different offences. The amendments were motivated simply by the perceived necessity to get around the difficulty with the discrepancy in the dates. Regrettably, in doing so, they generated the anomaly of suggesting on the face of each charge that there may have been two separate offences on two different dates.
In my opinion, the prosecution`s approach was erroneous. With respect to the district judge, I am of the view that the amendments to the charges should not have been allowed in the form tendered by the prosecution. The proper course was for the prosecution to apply to amend the charge, only to the extent of specifying that the offence was allegedly committed on or about 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991. In this way, it remains clear on the face of each charge that only one set of facts is relied upon, constituting only one offence. This removes the anomaly created by the alternative charges as framed. In any case, there can be no doubt that the charge would contain particulars which are reasonably sufficient to give the appellants notice of the matter with which they are charged.
Ultimately, the overriding consideration is whether any error or omission in framing the charge was such as to cause the appellants to be prejudiced or misled. In this respect, there is no real difficulty, given that the prosecution`s stand was that they were still prosecuting only one offence of corruption, except that they were unsure when it took place. Moreover, after the application for amendment was allowed on 30 August 1994, the defence was only called on 5 September 1994. There was sufficient time for the defence to reconsider their position and meet the prosecution`s case. The appellants elected not to recall any witnesses. I am satisfied that no prejudice to their defence was occasioned.
 (v) Treatment of the evidence of accomplices
In his grounds of decision, the district judge noted the obvious discrepancy in the prosecution`s case as to the date of the meeting at the Green Lounge. But, he was satisfied that there was consistent evidence of such a meeting having taken place, although there was no clear evidence as to whether it was on 5 July or 9 July 1991. He noted that both appellants did not deny that such a meeting did take place, except that they claimed not to recall when this was.
The district judge accepted that Tan`s evidence fitted in with the evidence of Ang and Leong that a meeting at the Blue Berry Lounge had been arranged. There was also consistent evidence that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss Ong Thian Lye`s arrest. Ringo`s testimony fortified the case that a meeting at the Green Lounge did in fact take place. All this went towards establishing when the offence was committed, since the evidence of Ong Thian Lye`s arrest and the meeting at the Blue Berry and Green lounges were the only common clues pointing to either 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991 being the date on which the offence was allegedly committed.
The district judge considered that it was incumbent on him to make a finding that the meeting at the Blue Berry and Green Lounges did take place, as the acceptance of the $2,000 by Garmaz in the presence of Jaswinder took place the day after this meeting. The district judge accepted that Ringo`s testimony on the date of the meeting was more reliable, since he was a totally independent witness who had the benefit of reference to his pocket diary.
On appeal, the appellants submitted that the district judge had erred in law in failing to direct his mind to the fact that Tan and especially Leong were accomplices whose evidence should have been treated with caution. This necessitated reference to Illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`), which states: 
 
the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.
 
 
 
The illustration does not say that an accomplice `shall` be presumed to be unworthy of credit. Apart from s 116 EA, two other statutory provisions are relevant. First, s 135 EA provides: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
There are clear authorities giving effect to this section, in particular, and . Reading s 135 and Illustration (b) to s 116 EA together, the effect is that the court may convict an accused based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should still treat such evidence with caution as the accomplice may be presumed to be unworthy of credit. This is the general position in respect of the evidence of accomplices. The Court of Appeal in observed (at p 270): 
 
The effect of (s 135 EA) ... is that it is no longer a requirement for a trial judge to give as part of his reasons that he had warned himself before accepting uncorroborated evidence to find an accused person guilty on a charge ... Having said that, we want to make it clear that it is still incumbent on the trial judge to scrutinise and weigh carefully the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice before acting on such evidence.
 
 
 
The first step, of course, is for the court to ascertain that the witnesses in question are accomplices. In the context of corruption cases in particular, it is important to note that s 25 PCA provides that: 
 
Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in s 24, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.
 
 
 
In and , the court observed that s 25 (then s 13(3) Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1950) modified the general law relating to treatment of the evidence of accomplices. In view of s 25 PCA, the maxim in Illustration (b) to s 116 EA is not invoked by the mere fact that the witness (whether or not he is an accomplice) has paid or delivered any gratification, or arranged for such acts to be done on his behalf, to a police officer. In `s case , Foster Sutton CJ opined that the maxim in Illustration (b) to s 116 EA would still apply, where the accomplice had played an `infamous part` in the corrupt act. On my understanding, this suggests that an accomplice who went beyond merely making a `payment or delivery ... of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body` would not come within the scope of s 25 PCA. Foster Sutton CJ`s view was adopted by Abdul Malik Ishak JC in . A similar approach was also taken by Syed Agil Barakbah J in
In my opinion, the approach in 
 Daimon bin Banda 
 may be adopted. It would appear that s 25 PCA may still apply in relation to Leong, since Leong had claimed not to know what the payment was all about initially. He could not be said to have knowingly played an `active` or `infamous` part in the transaction when he was not even aware that there was a corrupt element to the transaction at all. Only Tan could be said to be instrumental in initiating the corrupt transaction. In the premises, it could only be said that the district judge should have treated Tan`s evidence with caution. It appears to me that this was another reason why the district judge was only prepared to accept those aspects of Tan`s evidence which were supported by Leong.
While corroboration was not necessary to support Leong`s evidence, I am conscious that there was, strictly speaking, no corroboration. The evidence of Tan, Ang and even Ringo did not go to support Leong`s account of what transpired at Yishun Seafood Restaurant. Their evidence only went to show that a meeting did take place at the Blue Berry and Green Lounges on either 5 July 1991 or 9 July 1991. Adopting the classic formulation of principle in , there is only corroboration if there was independent evidence which implicated the appellants of the offence by connecting them with it, or evidence which confirmed in some material particular that the appellants had committed the offence.
The prosecution`s case was anchored primarily on Leong`s uncorroborated evidence. Even though there is no requirement for special caution, it was still incumbent on the trial judge to scrutinise the evidence with care. This is particularly so when the process of weighing the evidence consists primarily of pitting one person`s word against another`s. The prosecution is not relieved of the burden of proof. Counsel has pointed out some flaws and inconsistencies in Leong`s evidence. It appears to me, however, that Leong`s evidence was fairly consistent and did not reveal any material discrepancies. The only notable discrepancy as far as the prosecution was concerned is that Leong claimed to be sure that the offence took place on 6 July 1991, when Ringo alleged that it occurred on 10 July 1991. Having scrutinised Leong`s evidence, the district judge accepted that Leong was a witness of truth. The appellants would therefore have to prevail upon this court to rule that such a conclusion was plainly wrong.
 (vi) Whether notice of alibi required
The district judge agreed with the DPP`s submissions that the evidence of the appellants had to be treated with caution as they had not complied with the requirements in s 182 CPC. These relate to the provision of notice of alibi within the prescribed time. Moreover, in the two s 122(6) statements produced by the appellants, there was no mention of the claim that they were on 24-hour duty on 5 July 1991. The district judge found the lack of reference to an alibi defence to be a material non-disclosure.
On appeal, counsel for the appellants submitted that adverse inferences should not have been drawn from the `non-compliance` with s 182 CPC. By ruling that the appellants had not furnished the alibi notice and proceeding to treat their evidence with caution, the district judge had effectively raised the burden on the defence beyond the level of establishing reasonable doubt. In particular, counsel drew the court`s attention to the fact that the charge had averred that the place where he had abetted the commission of the offence was Ang Mo Kio police station. Jaswinder`s evidence was precisely that he was at Ang Mo Kio police station for the better part of the day, on both 6 July 1991 and 10 July 1991. Accordingly, no notice of alibi was required, as he was not claiming to have been somewhere else other than the place specified in the charge.
Counsel submitted in the alternative that, in any event, the alibi evidence was given within the prescribed period of 14 days from the time the amended alternative charges were read to both appellants. On this premise, the evidence was said to have been given within the time frame within which the appellants could have given any alibi evidence.
I shall deal with counsel`s alternative argument first. The argument does not purport to dispense with the requirement for an alibi notice in respect of the original charge. Under s 182 CPC, the accused is not permitted to give evidence in support of an alibi without the leave of the court unless notice of particulars of the alibi has been given before the end of the prescribed period (see also s 182(5) CPC). Section 182(9) CPC states: 
 
In this section -
 
 
 
`evidence in support of an alibi` means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of the accused at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time he was not, or was unlikely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission;
 
 
 
`prescribed period` means the period of 14 days from the end of the proceedings before the Magistrate on the occasion that the accused is charged in court for the first time with the offence in respect of which he raising the defence of an alibi.
 
 
 
With respect, s 182 CPC does not say that alibi evidence becomes admissible simply by virtue of the fact that it is adduced in court within the prescribed 14-day period. The requirement is for notice of particulars of the alibi evidence to be given within the prescribed period. The purpose is to enable the prosecution to verify the accused`s account so that they are able to challenge the accused`s version of events if it is appropriate to do so (). No such opportunity will be afforded if the `notice` can be constituted by merely raising the defence within 14 days of the amendment of the charge. Counsel`s argument therefore is not persuasive.
I turn now to examine counsel`s main submission on the question of the alibi notice. In cross-examination, Garmaz said that on 6 July 1991, he should have been sleeping at home after his 24-hour duty. It should be noted that he was not asserting this with any certainty or conviction. It was not part of his evidence-in-chief, in any event. Consequently, it is doubtful whether Garmaz was really relying on an alibi defence at all. Garmaz also said that he could not remember where he was on 10 July 1991. Thus, it is clear that he was not claiming to be somewhere else other than the place where the offence was allegedly committed on 10 July 1991. This was not evidence in support of an alibi.
Jaswinder asserted that on 6 July 1991 he was at the station and he arrived home at 2.30pm and stayed home the whole day. On 10 July 1991, he was again at the station, reaching home by 6.30pm in the evening and he stayed at home the whole night. As such, there is some merit in counsel`s point that Jaswinder was not raising evidence in support of an alibi at all, since Leong`s evidence was that he contacted Jaswinder in the afternoon on the day when the money was delivered. Jaswinder`s evidence was basically a denial of having received any telephone call from Leong at all. I agree, therefore, that there was no requirement for Jaswinder to furnish a notice of alibi. It made no difference whether this was in relation to the alleged commission of the offences on 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991. In all fairness to the district judge, he may have been misled by counsel`s agreement during the trial that the defence raised was indeed one of alibi.
Counsel for the appellants contended that the district judge had misdirected himself in law by his finding of material non-disclosures in respect of the alibi evidence, from his perusal of the appellants` s 122(6) statements. Once again, this argument merits consideration. There was no reliance on an alibi defence at all. A fortiori, there could not have been any material non-disclosure. I concur with counsel`s submission that s 123 CPC was wrongly invoked by the district judge. While the district judge did not expressly say that he drew adverse inferences from this non-disclosure, it seems implicit from the judge`s grounds that this was the consequence.
 (vii) Impeachment procedure in relation to Tan`s evidence
A further point raised on appeal was that the district judge had erred in law in failing to follow the prescribed procedure for impeachment of a witness`s credit. The contention was that the district judge should not have permitted counsel for the appellants and counsel holding a watching brief for Tan (Mr TU Naidu) to participate in the procedure for impeachment. Secondly, counsel contended that the district judge did not proceed to receive the further evidence of Tan by way of evidence-in-chief after the impeachment proceedings, thereby depriving the court of the benefit of his further evidence.
The district judge`s note of evidence reveals that Mr Naidu did cross-examine Sng Jin Poh (PW3), who was called to testify on the recording of the statement from Tan. There is no apparent precedent for this procedure. Assuming this was erroneous, there was no material irregularity which had occasioned a failure of justice. In my view, this similarly disposes of the arguments raised under this ground. The prosecution had no further need for Tan`s evidence after the impeachment proceedings, and he was thus released. These courses of action met with no objections whatsoever from defence counsel.
 (viii) Evidence adduced in respect of appearing before Police DisciplinaryBoard - rebuttal of character evidence
The appellants were both asked in cross-examination about their respective appearances before the Police Disciplinary Board. Both of them admitted to having pleaded guilty to disciplinary charges. The convictions related to engaging in other employment without permission of the Commissioner of Police (Jaswinder) and moonlighting (Garmaz). Counsel objected to the DPP`s question only in respect of Garmaz, but not in relation to Jaswinder. Jaswinder explained that he pleaded guilty out of convenience. Garmaz gave no explanation.
On appeal, it has been submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice in that the district judge had wrongly admitted the above evidence, and gone on to draw adverse inferences against both appellants. Counsel pointed to the line of questioning adopted by the defence in relation to Leong, which resulted in Leong`s disclosure that he had been charged in court and convicted of an offence under the PCA many years ago. Counsel submitted that this approach was perfectly legitimate, since Leong had given evidence of his payment of $2,000 to the appellants and was clearly an accomplice. It was not to be taken to be an attack on Leong`s character, such that the appellants would have correspondingly lowered their shield by bringing in Leong`s previous conviction. Counsel argued that the question was meant to ascertain whether Leong, being an accomplice, had been dealt with in court for the role he had played. If so, the court would be justified in giving his evidence greater weight, since he had nothing more to gain by falsifying evidence. It was also emphasised that Leong had volunteered the information, and neither the DPP nor the court had objected to this line of questioning.
With respect, I do not find counsel`s submissions helpful. First, it assumes that Leong was an accomplice, when no such finding has been made by the court. More importantly, the question which counsel asked Leong at trial was this: `Were you ever arrested by CPIB and charged for any offence?` The sweeping references to `ever arrested` and `any offence` were clearly meant to cover all previous convictions, and not just arrest or conviction arising from that particular offence involving the appellants. I do not see how Leong had `volunteered` the information when he was only giving his response to a question posed by counsel in cross-examination. To all intents and purposes, it appears that the main purpose of the question was to raise an issue as to Leong`s credibility. In my view, the facts fell squarely within s 122(7) EA. The appellants should be taken to have lowered their shield.
The Police Disciplinary Board convictions are not really connected in any way with the corruption charges in question. They do not indicate a propensity towards corruption. As such, the probative value of the evidence is minimal. At best, there is only some relevance towards the appellants` credibility, although I find it difficult to say that this shows that they were generally of bad disposition or reputation.
It is not clear whether any adverse inferences were drawn against Garmaz, although the district judge did take note of the fact that Garmaz had also appeared before the Police Disciplinary Board. The district judge, however, noted Jaswinder`s explanation and stated that he viewed this evidence with caution `as it could be inferred that (Jaswinder) has a propensity to lie`. With great respect, I am unable to follow the district judge`s reasoning. The prosecution did not suggest that Jaswinder was lying when he explained why he had pleaded guilty. In the absence of any other clear reasons, there is hardly any basis for inferring that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie.
 (ix) Analysis of the defence submissions
Counsel has strenuously argued that the numerous alleged errors or misdirections indicate that there was a miscarriage of justice, and that the defence had been prejudiced. I find that the district judge had erred in his treatment of certain issues. Specifically, these are: (i) the decision to allow the alternative charges to be preferred; (ii) the ruling that notice of alibi was necessary; and (iii) the inference that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie, on account of his explanation for his plea of guilt before the Police Disciplinary Board.
I have already expressed my view that no failure of justice was occasioned by the decision to allow alternative charges to be preferred. As for the point relating to the alibi notice, it is necessary to consider what the effect of the misdirection was. It appears to me that all the district judge said was that he would have to be more careful in dealing with the appellants` evidence. He remained conscious that the defence only needed to raise a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the district judge was clearly not entitled to draw adverse inferences pursuant to s 123 CPC. By his reference to `material non-disclosures`, it was evident that he had misdirected himself. Regrettably, this error was compounded by his willingness to infer that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie, when such an inference was quite unjustifiable on the evidence. These adverse inferences were erroneously drawn against the appellants, and must be excluded from consideration of the evidence against them.
The appeals turn on findings of fact. When one looks at the fundamentals, the main question is whether the allegations which found the prosecution case can be believed, such that the case can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I need not traverse the settled principles which guide appellate courts in interfering with findings of fact and credibility. As I have intimated earlier, the critical issue is whether it can be said that the district judge was plainly wrong in accepting that Leong was a witness of truth. Other than the contention that Leong`s evidence should have been treated with caution, which I do not accept, the defence has not presented any cogent argument on this basis.
The district judge`s treatment of the case was not flawless. I am unable to agree with the suggestion, however, that the errors or misdirections were so grave as to vitiate his conclusion that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I do not see any indication that the district judge`s assessment of Leong`s credibility had been affected by these errors. While the district judge may have erred in drawing adverse inferences against the appellants, I do not see how this has any material bearing on the fact that their defences were essentially bare denials. In the premises, I find no reason to interfere with the district judge`s acceptance that Leong was telling the truth.
 (x) Amendment of the charges and the public prosecutor`s consent
The only difficulty with the convictions in this case is that the alternative charges on which the appellants were convicted were patently inappropriate. In this connection, I turn now to consider whether the charges can be amended. Counsel argued that if this court was minded to amend the charges, it could only do so with the consent of the public prosecutor. Counsel submitted that this was what s 33 PCA necessarily implied. Section 33 PCA states: 
 
A prosecution under this Act shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.
 
 
 
It was urged upon this court that the amendments would effectively bring in new or different charges. Consequently, counsel argued that once such consent was obtained, the only available recourse was for this court to order a fresh trial, as the public prosecutor had not previously consented to the prosecution of the appellants on the amended charges.
This point requires some consideration. Counsel was unable to cite any authority directly supporting his propositions, nor could he point to any cases dealing with a similar question. , a decision of Kulasekaram J, is of no real assistance. It was only concerned with whether the form of the consent contained sufficient reference to the facts of the case. On the face of the consent in question, it did not contain reference to the facts upon which the consent was given. The prosecution did not adduce any further evidence to show the facts for which the consent was applicable. Kulasekaram J thus held that the prosecution had failed to comply with s 31 (now s 33 PCA) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960.
The Malaysian cases, tracing their lineage to , or are of even less assistance. The settled Malaysian position has been to consider a deputy public prosecutor as being capable of exercising all the rights and powers of the public prosecutor. Thus, it falls within the DPP`s powers to consent to a prosecution under the PCA (per Smith J in 
 Abdul Hamid 
, at p 232). It follows from this proposition that where prosecution is conducted by a DPP, the consent of the public prosecutor is implicit in his actions and no further written consent of the public prosecutor is required. Indeed, this was the holding of the Privy Council in . The ruling in 
 Oie Hee Koi 
 was followed in , , and .
Counsel submitted that the Malaysian cases were generally of limited persuasiveness, having proceeded as they did on the broad premise that a deputy public prosecutor may validly exercise all the powers of the public prosecutor. For comparative purposes, counsel diligently produced a copy of the Government Gazette S 281/85, which contains the Attorney General`s notification empowering his deputies to perform specific duties and functions. These do not include any reference to the public prosecutor`s function of issuing consent to the institution of prosecution pursuant to s 33 PCA.
Counsel referred me to a decision of the then senior district judge in . In this case, the DPP tendered amended charges under the PCA even before trial began. There was an existing consent from the public prosecutor in respect of the original charges. The question was whether the court had jurisdiction to proceed with the trial on the amended charges without a fresh consent by the public prosecutor. The district judge held that he did not have jurisdiction. He rejected the DPP`s submission, which was premised on the approach adopted in the Malaysian cases to the effect that a DPP was capable of granting consent in lieu of the public prosecutor. The prosecution discontinued its appeal.
In , a problem similar to that in 
 Wong Cheong Yoon 
 arose. Harun J ruled that as the public prosecutor had not given his consent for the amended charge, the trial was a nullity. This decision was not followed in 
 Mohamed Halipah 
. Yusof Abdul Rashid J took the view that no further written consent was required, as the DPP could amend the charge in his exercise of the powers of the public prosecutor. It was noted that Harun J had not been referred to the Privy Council decision in 
 Oie Hee Koi 
.
What is in issue at present is perhaps a more basic question: what does s 33 PCA specify? On a plain reading, it simply means that the public prosecutor`s consent is required before a prosecution under the PCA can be instituted. In , the meaning of `instituting` prosecution was considered. Wills J concluded that it means the commencement of prosecution. When prosecution can be said to have commenced is dependent on whether any peculiar requirements for prosecution may operate in each case. For instance, in the present case, every offence under the PCA is seizable. Quite obviously, prosecution does not commence the moment the accused is arrested, as the Attorney General`s consent may not be forthcoming at the point of arrest. I would agree with the views of the district court in 
 Wong Cheong Yoon 
(at p 268) thus: 
 
... the moment the public prosecutor decides on such a course, ie to have the alleged offender charged and tried in court, this will signify the `commencement` of the prosecution of the alleged offender under the Act.
 
 
 
I should add that in , the Federal Court took the view that a prosecution for the purposes of the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 was instituted when the accused was called upon to plead to the charge. It is not open to me to adopt this view, on account of the marked difference between the relevant statutory provisions.
Counsel submitted that the public prosecutor retains overall control and direction over all criminal prosecutions, on account of s 336 CPC. Consenting to prosecution under the PCA was part and parcel of these responsibilities. Accordingly, if the charge had to be amended, it required his consent anew, as he had only directed his mind to the facts constituting the original charge. Nevertheless, counsel conceded that if the amendment was minor or purely typographical, perhaps it would not be necessary for a fresh consent to be obtained.
In my opinion, the general proposition that flows from s 33 PCA is that the public prosecutor`s consent is only a prerequisite to the commencement of prosecution. Having regard to Kulasekaram J`s observations in 
 Nagalingam 
, the duty of the public prosecutor under s 33 PCA is to apply his mind to whether prosecution should commence under the PCA in respect of a particular accused on a particular set of facts. There is nothing which expressly requires the Attorney General as public prosecutor to give his consent afresh if the charge has to be amended after the prosecution has commenced. None of the authorities refutes this general proposition. This proposition would not apply, however, if what had been sought was, for example, to introduce a different set of material facts, or to prefer more serious charges against the accused than those expressly specified in the existing consent. A fortiori, it should not apply if the amendment seeks to frame a new charge for which the public prosecutor`s consent under a different statute might have been needed.
I hasten to add that the approach I have adopted is not based on the Malaysian approach of considering the DPP equally competent to exercise the public prosecutor`s powers. I propose to leave this line of argument open for subsequent discussion, since this appeal does not turn on whether the Malaysian approach should be adopted.
Reverting to the present case, the public prosecutor has given his consent to prosecution in clear terms and has specified the appropriate charge in each case. The essential facts have also been set out in the consents and the charges from the outset. They have remained unchanged. Indeed, consents from the public prosecutor were in fact obtained twice, for both the original charges as well as the amended alternative charges. The amendments which I propose to make do not bring the charges beyond the scope of the PCA, nor do they seek to introduce any material new facts. In the circumstances, I see no reason why the public prosecutor`s consent should be obtained a third time.
The only amendments which I deem necessary are to eliminate the `alternative` charges, and to introduce the alternative date into the original charges. I see this as being the lesser of two evils. This removes the anomaly in the present charges, which seem to suggest that two distinct offences could have been committed on different dates. The amended charges will read as follows. In respect of Garmaz: 
 
You, Garmaz s/o Pakhar M/32 yrs, NRIC No S1449144/I are charged that you, on or about 6 or 10 July 1991, at the Yishun Seafood Village Restaurant, Sembawang Road, Singapore being an agent, to wit, a Police Sergeant in the employ of the Singapore Police Force and attached to the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, did corruptly accept from Barlly Tan Kim Hock through one Leong Kin Eng @ Christopher Leong for yourself a gratification of a sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) as an inducement for you to do an act in relation to your principal`s affairs, to wit, recommend to take no further action on a case against the said Leong Kin Eng who was being investigated by you for illegal money-lending, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
In respect of Jaswinder: 
 
You, Jaswinder Singh s/o Mota Singh M/46 yrs, NRIC 1027086/C are charged that you, on or about 6 or 10 July 1991, at the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9, Singapore, did abet one Garmaz s/o Pakhar, in the commission of an offence of corruptly accepting a gratification of $2,000, to wit, by intentionally arranging with one Barlly Tan Kim Hock to give the said sum of money to him through one Leong Kin Eng which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 27(a) read with s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
I am mindful that neither the prosecution nor the defence has voiced any objection to an amendment to the charges, save that the defence contends that the Attorney General`s fresh consent is required. I have already clarified my views on this contention. I should state nonetheless that in doing so, I respectfully decline to follow the decisions of and . In these cases, it was held that the High Court, acting in its appellate capacity, could not amend the charge. In , no reasons were given for Wee Chong Jin CJ`s ruling. In , it was conceded by the prosecution that the court could not convict the accused on an amended charge. Whyatt CJ agreed that this was because s 156 (now s 163) CPC requires the amended charge to be read and explained to the accused, and it was not necessarily the case that the accused would be present on appeal. It appears that Whyatt CJ`s concern was because the accused might then wish to tailor his evidence to the amended charge or to adduce fresh evidence or recall witnesses.
With respect, the reason given in 
 Quek Ching Kim 
 is not persuasive. Where a custodial sentence is involved, the accused is bonded to appear in the High Court whenever he lodges an appeal against his conviction. There is thus no question of his absence from the High Court when his appeal is being heard, unless the sentence was a fine only. Furthermore, there are authorities which suggest that the High Court may `alter the finding` pursuant to the current s 256(b)(ii) CPC and convict the appellant on a substituted charge (see , , , and ). It is hard to see why the High Court may not also `alter the finding` by convicting on an amended charge. After all, substituting a charge surely has more far-reaching consequences than amending a charge. The cases which sanction the substitution of a charge emphasise that safeguards should apply to prevent prejudice to the appellant. Thus, for instance, Cussen J in 
 Ng Ee 
`s case26 observed (at p 149): 
 
It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same - that the prosecution evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused`s defence the same.
 
 
 
In short, the court must be certain that the amendment should not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below. There is no practical utility in requiring the charge to be read and explained again to the accused, since there is no question of him seeking to tailor his evidence or adduce fresh evidence to meet the amended charge. For these reasons, I do not accept the reasoning and the conclusion in 
 Quek Ching Kim 
. It is implicit that, if the High Court can `alter the finding` pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) CPC, it can also amend the charge, as long as the safeguards against prejudice are taken into account.
I am satisfied that the amended charges can in no way prejudice the appellants` defence. The amendments only pertain to the form of the charges. It is clear that the proceedings in the trial would have taken the same course. The evidence recorded would have been the same. Accordingly, I see no difficulty in ordering the amendments. The appellants will stand convicted on the amended charges as I am satisfied that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Counsel made a brief plea in mitigation of sentence. I am unable to discern any grounds to disturb the sentence of six months` imprisonment which was imposed. In the premises, I uphold the convictions and sentences of both appellants. Both their appeals will be dismissed.

    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Timothy Michael Donnelly (the applicant) returned to Australia from overseas at 7.30 am on 11 November 2004. He was a passenger on a British Airways flight from London via Singapore. Having cleared Customs, he went to a flat in Neutral Bay. 
     
      
    4 At approximately 2.50 pm on 13 November 2004, Mr Donnelly presented at the Emergency Department of the Royal North Shore Hospital. He complained of severe abdominal pain. He disclosed to medical staff that, before leaving London, he had swallowed a number of pellets made from plastic and ducting tape containing the drug ecstasy. He had already regurgitated a small number of the pellets. 
     
      
    5 An x-ray was undertaken and revealed a large number of foreign objects in the stomach and intestines. He was suffering from severe abdominal obstruction and required immediate surgery. 
     
      
    6 The police were notified. At 4.45 pm Mr Donnelly underwent a laparotomy. Sixty-five pellets were removed. The operation was witnessed by the police who took possession of the pellets. 
     
      
    7 Later the same evening, the police searched Mr Donnelly's flat at Neutral Bay. The person with whom Mr Donnelly shared the flat handed the police a further 12 pellets, being the pellets he had regurgitated the previous day. 
     
      
    8 Each pellet was later examined. There were 77 pellets in all, each weighing about 5 mgs. One pellet contained 4.7 grams of cocaine. The remaining 76 contained the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) in powder form. 
     
      
    9 On Sunday 14 November 2004, the police spoke to Mr Donnelly at the hospital. He was informed that he was under arrest for the possession of prohibited imports. He was also formally cautioned. 
     
      
    10 On 17 November 2004, a bedside court was conducted. Once discharged from hospital, Mr Donnelly remained in custody. Pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 2 February 2005. When the matter came before Nield DCJ on 22 April 2005, the charges were reformulated and can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : That on 11 November 2004, he was in possession of a prohibited import, contrary to s233B(1)(a)(vi) of the Customs Act 1901, namely ecstasy, in an amount not less than the trafficable quantity of that drug. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : Further, that on the same day and contrary to the same section, he was in possession of the prohibited import cocaine, in a quantity not less than the trafficable quantity. 
        
       
      
    11 The Commonwealth Act, unlike the State Act, is concerned with the quantity of pure drug imported. In each case the drugs had a high level of purity, namely: 
     
      
    · Ecstasy: 278.69 grams pure MDMA (representing over 77% of the 362.3 grams imported). 
     
      
    · Cocaine: 3.9 grams pure (representing 84.6% of the 4.7 grams imported). 
     
      
    12 A ""trafficable quantity"" of MDMA or ecstasy under the Customs Act is 0.5 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 500 grams. Accordingly, as noted by his Honour, the amount imported exceeded by many times the trafficable quantity and was over half of a commercial quantity. 
     
      
    13 In the case of cocaine, a ""trafficable quantity"" is 2 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 2 kilograms. The amount imported, therefore, was just over the trafficable quantity. 
     
      
       
      Issues before the Sentencing Judge. 
       
      
    14 As mentioned, Mr Donnelly came before Judge Nield in the District Court on 22 April 2005 for sentence. He was represented by Mr Sutherland SC. In an opening address, counsel identified the issue. The penalty section under the Customs Act, s235(2)(d)(i), at that time fixed a maximum penalty in respect of each charge of a fine not exceeding $550,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both. However, where the Court is satisfied (the onus being upon the offender) that the offence was not ""for a purpose related to the sale of, or other commercial dealing in, the drugs"", the maximum penalty for each offence was a fine not exceeding $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both (s235(3) and s235(2)(e)) (since repealed). It was Mr Donnelly's case that the drugs were imported for his personal use. They were not imported with a view to sale.  
     
      
    15 The sentencing proceedings, which I will shortly describe, continued over a number of days. His Honour reserved his judgment. On 12 August 2005 he passed sentence. I will examine his reasons shortly. He expressed his conclusion in these terms: (ROS paras 29/30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""29. I am not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use. On the contrary, the quantity of MDMA that he imported into Australia and the value, both wholesale value and street value, of the tablets that could be produced from that quantity of MDMA powder suggest, quite obviously, that he imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially. 
        
       
       
        
        30. However, on the other hand, as the quantity is small and the potential street value is small, I am satisfied that the offender imported the cocaine for his own use, to use his words 'for a bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour therefore sentenced Mr Donnelly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : Imprisonment for 6 years 9 months commencing on 13 November 2004 expiring on 12 August 2011; with a non parole period of 4 years commencing on 13 November 2004 and expiring on 12 November 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : A concurrent sentence of 11 months and 7 days. 
        
       
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    17 The Notice of Appeal identified four grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    18 Before dealing with the arguments, I should describe the evidence given during the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Proceedings. 
       
      
    19 When the sentencing proceedings began on 22 April 2005, the Crown tendered a number of documents. There was no issue concerning the circumstances of importation. The agreed facts included the following material as to the value of the drugs imported. In respect of cocaine, the following was said: (AB p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Based on a figure of between $200 and $300 per gram for impure cocaine, the street value of the cocaine seized from the Defendant is about $2,228 and $2,340."" 
        
       
      
    20 As to the ecstasy, the agreed facts were in these terms: (AB p12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Imported MDMA tablets normally have a purity of 30% to 50% and a weight of 0.2 to 0.3 of a gram. Using this range, an ecstasy tablet has from 0.06 to 0.15 of a gram of pure MDMA. The MDMA powder would produce between 3095 (0.3 gram) to 4643 (0.2 gram) tablets at 30% purity. The MDMA powder would produce between 1857 (03. gram) to 2786 (0.2 gram) tablets at 50% purity. 
        
       
       
        
        In November 2004, the street value of MDMA tablets in NSW ranged from $30 to $60 with $50 being the more typical price. Based on these figures, the street value of the MDMA is between $92,850 and $232,150. Based on a figure of $20 per tablet for MDMA as a bulk price, the wholesale value of the MDMA is between $37,140 and $92,860."" 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown also tendered a statement by Det Sgt Stipnieks, an officer in the Australian Federal Police experienced in drug matters. Sgt Stipnieks said that commercial importations of ecstasy in powder form were extremely rare (8.7.05: T2). Ecstasy was soluble. It could be ingested by snorting or in liquid form. When cross examined by counsel for Mr Donnelly, Sgt Stipnieks said this: (8.7.05: T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. There would need to be a refining and/or manufacturing process undertaken by somebody to turn it into the tablet form? 
         
        A. No, it would only require a pill press. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It would require firstly somebody to cut it with an appropriate substance -- 
         
        A. It could be cut down further from the imported seizure, yes. I agree with that."" 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown also tendered a report of the Probation and Parole Service dated 21 April 2005. The report included a history of Mr Donnelly's involvement with drugs. Mr Donnelly, in his evidence, enlarged upon that history. His Honour, in his remarks, accepted that Mr Donnelly had, in the years preceding 11 November 2004, a significant involvement with drugs. His Honour said this: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""5. Whilst at the senior school at Newington College, he commenced to smoke cannabis and to use other prohibited drugs. Whilst at school, he was able to keep his use of prohibited drugs hidden and under control."" 
        
       
      
    23 Having left school, the applicant worked for his father. His drug use increased. His Honour continued: (ROS 2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""7. Then, during 1996, he was driving a motor vehicle which was involved in a collision with a cliff face on the Sydney-Newcastle freeway, which collision resulted in the death of his girlfriend. A search of his car revealed that he was in possession of prohibited drugs and analysis of a sample of his blood revealed that he had been driving the car with MDMA, commonly called ecstasy, in his blood. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs. He was dealt with for the offences of dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs at the end of 1997. He was sentenced to imprisonment for one year six months, with a non-parole period of twelve months to be served by home detention, and a parole period of six months, for the offence of dangerous driving causing death and he was fined $1,000 for each of the two offences of possessing a prohibited drug."" 
        
       
      
    24 Having completed his sentence, Mr Donnelly resumed the use of prohibited drugs, principally ecstasy. He said he used them ""on a recreational basis"" (22.4.05: T14). In 2001 he moved to London. He gave the following history to the Probation Officer concerning his drug use once in London: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly reported that after moving to London in 2001 he began using ecstasy and cocaine heavily. After the death of his father, in mid 2003, his usage increased, particularly ecstasy usage. He claimed he was using round 1 gram of ecstasy daily."" 
        
       
      
    25 After his father's death, Mr Donnelly received an inheritance of $100,000 and an annuity of $30,000. He travelled extensively. He had a Brazilian girlfriend and spent some time in South America and Europe, where he continued his use of drugs. He squandered much of his inheritance. The Probation Officer concluded her report in these terms: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly has had a longstanding problem with abuse of illicit drugs; which appears to be a substantial factor in his motivation to commit the offences."" 
        
       
      
    26 As mentioned, his Honour accepted that Mr Donnelly was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy before the offence (ROS para 28). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant's Evidence. 
       
      
    27 The applicant's credibility was obviously fundamental if he hoped to persuade his Honour (on the balance of probabilities) that the drugs he imported were for his own use. Whilst he was a heavy drug user, the amount of ecstasy imported (362.3 grams) was very substantial. When first called to give evidence, the applicant sought to explain that amount by the following evidence: (22.4.05: T20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And did you continue your usage of ecstasy in London? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How much ecstasy would you take in a day? 
         
        A. In powder form anywhere up to a gram. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about in tablet form? 
         
        A. I very rarely took tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now there's not a lot of powder form ecstasy seen in this country, how do you use it in powder form? 
         
        A. You can snort it or eat it, mix it with drinks."" 
        
       
      
    28 His evidence continued: (22.4.05: T22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. And so far as the ecstasy was concerned the quantity that you purchased I think in bulk terms is about 360-odd grams -- 
         
        A. That's correct."" 
        
       
      
    29 Mr Donnelly then said this: (22.4.05: T22/23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... Did you propose to sell any of that ecstasy? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you propose to do with it? 
         
        A. To use it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long did you think, without using a slide rule and a calculator, but how long did you think it would last? 
         
        A. I figured about a year."" 
        
       
      
    30 The evidence that he used a gram a day, in the context of an importation of 362.3 grams and 365 days in a year, was an important aspect of Mr Donnelly's testimony. His evidence continued as follows: (22.4.05: T23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. How regularly were you using a gram a day? 
         
        A. Almost every day of the week, it varied, on weekends I'd use more, some days I'd use less. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I appreciate this comes from your perception as opposed to an external perception but what effect on your day to day life did it have? 
         
        A. Well it seemed normal at the time. Looking back on it with a clear head it had a pretty detrimental effect. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But how did you perceive it at the time? 
         
        A. I felt pretty normal to be honest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And for what period of time or what length in your life had you been using effectively a gram a day? 
         
        A. Two or three years, two years."" 
        
       
      
    31 During cross examination by the Crown, his Honour asked a number of questions, including the following: (22.4.05: T33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. Did you know the purity of the MDMA that you'd purchased? 
         
        A. I'd tested it but I didn't know what the purity is mathematically. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It exceeds seventy per cent, you know that now? 
         
        A. I do now yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that's greater than the street percentage isn't it? 
         
        A. I don't know what the street percentage is to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour also asked the following questions: (22.4.05: T34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. What the Crown Prosecutor is asking you is that you know that MDMA is usually sold in tablet form? 
         
        A. Yes sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you know that tablets are made from powder? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the tablets that are made from powder have an admixture of MDMA and other things, you know that don't you? 
         
        A. I've heard that happens yeah sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know you could have cut the powder that you brought into Australia by fifty per cent, don't you? 
         
        A. I never even considered it to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    33 At the end of the examination, Mr Sutherland, counsel for Mr Donnelly, said this: (22.4.05: T38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your Honour if I can candidly say I was just a little concerned in relation to some of the questions from your Honour as to whether or not in the circumstances your Honour might be assisted by some pharmacological evidence which I don't have available today ..."" 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Sutherland continued: (T39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I must say my perception sitting here and just listening to the few questions that your Honour did ask gave me cause for pause to think that maybe that is evidence of a kind that might be of some assistance to your Honour if your Honour were felt weighed down by the healthy judicial scepticism, based on experience of course, of the purity of this particular substance."" 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour acknowledged that Mr Sutherland's perception was right and that he was sceptical (T39). The matter was adjourned to enable the applicant to place before the Court pharmacological evidence as foreshadowed by Mr Sutherland.  
     
      
    36 The proceedings resumed on 8 July 2005. A report had, in the meantime, been procured from Associate Professor Starmer, the professor of pharmacology at the University of Sydney. Professor Starmer's report included these words: (AB 38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""14. The residual effects after MDMA (75 - 150 mg) include exhaustion, fatigue, depression, nausea, numbness, feelings of coldness, anxiety attacks, persistent insomnia, rage reactions, psychosis and, possibly, flashbacks. The residual effects of MDMA may persist for period of several hours up to two weeks after drug ingestion. Users develop a rapid tolerance to MDMA. Most users will therefore (for financial reasons) allow an interval of at least a week between doses of the drug. More frequent use of MDMA results in a reduction of the pleasant effects and an increase in the unpleasant effects of the drug. If Mr Donnelly planned to take ecstasy tablets every day, the desired effects are likely to have become progressively less evident. ..."" 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Donnelly was recalled. He described, for the first time, certain adverse side effects of ecstasy. The examination in chief was in these terms: (8.7.05: T2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When your usage increased, and I think you explained to his Honour initially upwards of something in the order of five days a week or thereabouts? 
         
        A. Sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did the increased usage, that is where you were not having a gap of four or five or days or a week in between usage. What difference if any did that make to you? 
         
        A. Well, the drug would work again. It stops working when you do it every day over a period of time, so you need to take a couple of days off to make it work properly again. You start to feel pretty, pretty sick after a while as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am sorry, I missed that last -- ? 
         
        A. You start to feel pretty sick after long periods of using it."" 
        
       
      
    38 Given these effects, Mr Donnelly described his practice in taking the drug in these terms: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. If you got to the stage during your heavy usage where you were feeling nauseous and sick, so you took a day or a couple of days off, would you be off the drug completely or would you use it in any way? 
         
        A. I'd still taste a little bit or snort a tiny amount even on days off, but just enough to get the taste and the feel, not really for a drugs effect."" 
        
       
      
    39 He was asked about Professor Starmer's report: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You understand that during the adjournment period, your solicitor has obtained from Professor Starmer as you just saw me tender --? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- a report. Have you seen that report? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    40 When cross examined, Mr Donnelly said this: (T5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Sir, you said that you have not seen this report by Professor Starmer? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you discussed it with your legal representatives at all? 
         
        A. I spoke briefly to Michael Kirby this morning."" 
        
       
      
    41 When questioned further, Mr Donnelly added: (T5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you talk about how the report indicates that people who use MDMA more frequently than once a week tend to have a result where the pleasant effect is reduced and there is an increase in the unpleasant effects? 
         
        A. He -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you discuss that? 
         
        A. -- he read me a small excerpt from the report, I think that was one of the lines yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did discuss that? 
         
        A. Yeah he read me a small excerpt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you also discuss the unpleasant, what those unpleasant effects are for example, depression, restlessness, nausea, did you discuss those things? 
         
        A. No I don't think so."" 
        
       
      
    42 It was put to Mr Donnelly that he had changed his account, and had tailored his evidence so that it did not conflict with that of Professor Starmer. He denied that suggestion, providing the following explanation: (T7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. No what I've done is I've taken the average of say I was using seven grams a week and just divided it by the days. I was using the drug every day and mostly I'd be using a gram a day."" 
        
       
      
    43 Against this background, let me turn to the grounds of appeal. It is convenient to deal with a number of grounds together. 
     
      
       
      Arguments on Appeal. 
       
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
      
    44 Mr Glissan QC appeared for Mr Donnelly on the appeal. He submitted that the material before the sentencing Judge amounted to a powerful case that his motivation was personal, not commercial. He was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy, as his Honour accepted. He was psychologically dependant upon it. He could be expected to need the drug once he returned to Australia. It was much cheaper in London. Whilst he had a number of convictions, none related to drug dealing. Unusually, the drug was in powder form, rather than tablet form. He was in the habit of using the drug in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks had not previously heard of an importation of ecstasy in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks agreed that the drug was much more readily saleable and valuable in tablet form. There was no evidence that Mr Donnelly had a pill press or the know-how or connections to transform the drugs from powder to tablet. 
     
      
    45 These were all matters said to support his claim that he imported the drugs for personal use. They were matters in the applicant's submission, that his Honour was obliged to weigh and accept or reject. Instead, his Honour had, in the passage already quoted (para 29) (supra para 13), simply adverted to the quantity and value of the drugs imported. In written submissions, the applicant said this in respect of that approach: 
     
      
       
        
        ""22. These do not, it is submitted, amount to reasons at all. There was no issue about the quantity or the commercial value of the drug beyond that identified above. More, there was no evidentiary basis for linking the accused at any past time with other than personal use of the drugs, nor quantity apart, for doing so on this occasion. To the contrary his long history of addiction, so carefully weighed by his Honour, argued strongly for the defence he advanced."" 
        
       
      
    46 There was, according to the applicant, nothing beyond the quantity of the drugs which led his Honour to reject the applicant's case (para 26). 
     
      
    47 The Crown responded to these submissions by drawing attention to the findings his Honour made before his conclusions, which are set out above. Contrary to the applicant's submissions, his Honour did, according to the Crown, reject significant aspects of the applicant's evidence. He said this: (ROS p7/8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""27. The offender claims that, as he was a regular and heavy user of MDMA, using up to a gram of it almost every day of the week, something that he had done for two or three years, he purchased the MDMA which he imported into Australia for his own use, purchasing sufficient to last him about a year. Also, he claims that he purchased the cocaine which he imported into Australia for his own personal use so that he could have a 'little bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour continued, making the following adverse finding against the applicant: (ROS p8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. I do not doubt that MDMA and cocaine are widely available, easily obtainable and cheaper to purchase in London than in Sydney. I do not doubt that the offender was a regular and heavy user of MDMA at the time of his arrest and that he had been such a user of it for two or three years before his arrest,  
        although I doubt that he used as much of it each day and that he used it almost every day as he claimed 
        . ..."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    49 The remarks continued, again commenting adversely upon the applicant's evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. ... Also, I do not doubt that he had used other prohibited drugs, including cocaine, before his arrest.  
        However, I do not accept that he did not know the approximate purity of street quality MDMA and the approximate purity of MDMA that he had purchased. 
         A regular and heavy user of a prohibited drug, whether it was heroin, cocaine, amphetamine or MDMA, would want to know the approximate purity of the drug being purchased so as to ensure value for money, and being used so as not to endanger his or her own life."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    50 It was within that context that his Honour stated that he was not satisfied that the applicant had imported the MDMA for his own personal use (ROS para 29), referring to the value of the drugs, both wholesale and street value. It was, he said, quite obvious that he had ""imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially"" (ROS para 29). 
     
      
    51 In my view, his Honour provided adequate reasons. He made it clear that he did not accept the applicant's evidence concerning the level of his use, one gram per day. The suggestion of a year's supply of drugs for personal use, imported at some personal risk, both physically and legally, stretches one's credulity. That evidence having been rejected, so that the supply was plainly for more than a year (and perhaps considerably more), it is hardly surprising that his Honour was not persuaded on the civil onus. 
     
      
    52 I would reject grounds (a), (b) and (c). 
     
      
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    53 This aspect was not the subject of written or oral submissions. The sentence was plainly within range. It was not too severe. I would likewise reject ground (d). 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    54 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. But the appeal dismissed.

BLACKBURN J. 

I had come to the  conclusion  that  this  appeal  should 

be dismissed, and  I had  prepared reasons for  judgment 

supporting  that  conclusion.  Having  afterwards had  the great 
advantage of an  opportunity  to  read  the  reasons for judgment 
prepared  by  my  brethren, I am  now  convinced, by  their 
searching  examination of  the  legislative  history,  that s . 5 5 6  
of the  Crimes Act  1900  (N.S.W.)  in  its  application  to  the 
Australian  Capital  Territory,  must be  construed  as  barring 
both civil and  criminal  proceedings;  that  White v.  Ellis 
( 1 9 8 3 )   47  A.C.T.R.7? 
that  the  appeal  must  be  allowed. 

must in  this  respect  be  overruled:  and 

This result is capable  of  causing  grave  injustice. 

Section 556  was  originally  intended, as my  brethren 
demonstrate, to prevent  multiplicity  of  actions  and  to  put a 
person  aggrieved  by an  act  which is both a  crime and a  tort  to 
his  election  to  institute  either  civil or criminal 

proceedings.  In  modern  times,  when  criminal  prosecutions are 

almost  invariably  initiated  by  the police,  when  the  law of 
tort is so much  more  highly  developed,  and  awards of damages 
are so much  larger,  the  section is capable  of  providing  a 
totally  unmeritorious  defence  to  an  action  for  damages. 

I agree  with  the  order  proposed  by  my  brethren.

not  only  criminal  but also  clvll  proceedlngs  ""for  che  same

clearly  cspable  of  encompassing ~1,111 proceedings.  The use  of

fgrther 

crlminal  proceedlngs  is  strengthened  when  the  provlElons 
s . 2 8   of  9  Geo. IV c.31  are  taken  into  account. 
makes It  plaln  thac,  in  relation  to  the  sublecc  matter  dealt 
with in that  statute,  the  bar  was  to  extend  to both clvll  and 
crlmlnal  proceedings.  But  for  the  incluslon  of  the  words 

Thac  sectzon 

of

""civll  or  criminal""  the  section  uses,  s b   far as  materlal, 
Identical  language  to  that  used  in  the  earlier  provislons.  It 
seems to  us  that  the lncluslon of  those  words  is  more  likely to 
have been  due  to a  deslre  on  the  part  of the  leglslature  to 
remove  any  doubt as to  the  extent of the  bar  than  to  reflect an

In  the introductlon  to  the  work  clted  Greaves  drew 

atteqtion  to the  difflculties  attendant  upon  the  consoildation 
of statutes.  At p.xv  the  learned author said: 

""Another difficulty  arlsing  from  such  a course 15, 
that a clause  In  one  statute  may.  elther  by  itself, 
o r   construed  wlth the  rest  of t:?at  statute,  bear 
one  meanlnq.  but  when  transferred  Into  a 
Consolldatlon  Act,  and  separated  from 
1 c s   former 
associated  clauses.  m d   placed  amongst  other 
clauses  taken  from  other A c t s ,   l t  may be open to an 
entirely different construccicn:  and. in  thls  point 
one  of  the  qreatest  difficultlos  in consolldatioc 
consists; f ~ r  it  is  hardly  possible. even wlth the 
greatest care, to  foresee the 2ffect of placl.nq  in 
the  same Act,  especially  ~f it  be  a l m q   Act. 
And  m such 
clauses  taken  from  different  Accs. 
cases  this 
foreseen, a~? alberatlon  of some  kind  sust  be  made. 
and  then  the  question  lmmedxately  arises  what  that 
alteratior.  ought  to  be,  and. in  this  the  greatest 
lawyers  may  differ, and  lf  m y  alteration  ln che 
law  be  made,  It  at  once  ceases  to  be  mere 
consolldatlon.  If  the  effect  is not  fDreseen.  then 
the lzw  will be thrown  lnto  confuslon."" 

If tine  effect  is 

dilemma  arises. 

It was  no doubt  because of  the  dlfflculties that were  thouqht

of assaults  to  which it  is  dlrected  does not, in our  opinion, 
assist  the  argument  that s.556  is directed  only  to  release from 
crimiral  proceedlngs.  The history of  the  relevant  sections  to 

which  we  have  referred  demonstrates  that  the  argument  is

whlch is  plainly  limlted 
to  barrmg  criminal  proceedlngs,  uses 
the  words  ""is  not

556  on  the  other  hand  uses  the  word  ""proceeding""  not 
""prosecution"", the  latter  belng  approprlate  only  to  crimlnal 

proceedlngs.  Nor 

is the word  ""offence"" used  in  5 . 5 5 6   or, for 
that  matter,  in s.481. 
The word  ""offence"" is  appropriate  only 
to  crlminal  proceedings;  ""cause"" is  equally  applicable to both 
crlminal  and  civil  proceedlngs:  see  Greaves at p.74.

The  purpose  of

Crmes 
ss.481,  499  and  5561,  they  have appeared

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Fraud—Employee
filing false expense accounts as a means of increasing salary—Belief by accused
of employer's sanction—Whether intention to defraud—Conviction quashed by Court
of Appeal—Whether quashing based on grounds of law—Whether quashing should be
upheld—Criminal Code  1953—54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The respondent, the Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police, was
convicted at trial under s. 323(1)  of the Criminal Code  on a number of
counts charging him with having defrauded the public and the Government of the Province
 of Quebec of various sums of money. In 1952, he applied for an increase in his
salary. He was told by the head of his Department, the Solicitor General who
had referred his application to the Attorney General, that he was entitled to
an increase but due to the fact that a general survey of salaries in the Civil
Service was in progress, an increase could not be granted at the time. However,
he was told that he could draw a certain amount per month by way of expenses. A
large number of the expense accounts which were thereafter submitted by the
respondent were admittedly fictitious. This practice continued until 1960 when
his salary was increased. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts
ceased. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave
to appeal to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting):
The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of guilty restored.

[Page 175]

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the
uncontradicted evidence of the respondent himself, no other conclusion could be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, no other conclusion in
law could be reached save that he had defrauded the provincial government and
the public of the amounts which he thus obtained. With the exception of certain
counts in the indictment on which he was acquitted, there was no evidence on
the basis of which any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to
the respondent having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of
expenses which were fictitious and false. On an appeal from a conviction, if an
Appellate Court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is
not capable of creating any doubt, there is an error in law. It is no answer to
a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the
accused nor is the proposition that the province and the public were not
defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely
because the respondent's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought
it ought to be. To hold so was an error in law.

The guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depended
upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Courts below. This
raised questions of law in respect of which there was error. There was,
therefore, a right of appeal to this Court by the Crown.

Per Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting:
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed
fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense. It
follows that this Court had no power to review the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, since it is a well-settled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal
to this Court is limited to questions of law in the strict sense and that when
a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and
the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be
dismissed.

LE JUGE EN CHEF
(dissident):—Mon collègue M. le Juge
Cartwright a résumé tous les faits essentiels à la détermination de cette
cause, et il est donc inutile de les relater de nouveau. ll me suffira de dire
simplement que le juge de première instance a acquitté le prévenu sous sept des
chefs d'accusation, qu'il l'a trouvé coupable de tentative 

[Page 176]

de fraude sous trois chefs
distincts et a rendu un jugement de culpabilité sous tous les autres chefs.

La Cour du banc de la reine[2]
a cassé le jugement rendu en première instance, et permission spéciale a été
accordée au prévenu de loger un appel devant cette Cour. (Code Criminel
598).

Cet appel cependant ne peut
porter que sur des questions de droit et nullement sur des questions de faits
ou des questions mixtes de droit et de faits.

Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il
me semble clair que la majorité de la Cour du banc de la reine, en délivrant
son jugement, a fait reposer en partie ses conclusions sur des questions de
faits, ou au moins sur des questions mixtes de droit et de faits qu'il nous est
interdit de reviser.

II faut, pour que la Cour Suprême
du Canada ait juridiction, qu'il s'agisse d'une question de droit stricte dans
le vrai sens du mot. (508 C. Cr) (Rex. v. Décary[3]
).

Comme je crois que cet appel
comporte l'appréciation de questions de faits, je suis d'opinion que cette Cour
n'a pas juridiction et que l'appel doit être rejeté.

The judgment of Cartwright and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the
District of Quebec1, dated July 26, 1963, allowing an appeal from the judgment
of His Honour Judge Dumontier dated September 28,1962, and directing that the
respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted.

On July 16, 1962, the
respondent, who had elected to be tried by a Judge without a jury, was
arraigned before His Honour Judge Dumontier on an indictment containing three
counts to which he pleaded ""not guilty"". We are concerned only with
count 3, which reads as follows:

3°. entre le 1er
janvier 1952 et le 1er juillet 1960, dans les cité et district de
Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs, donc Commandant à Québec,
par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou
en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs
pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général et le Gouvernement de la Province de
Québec, pour une somme d'au moins $8,999.10, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21.

[Page 177]

On July 17, 1962, the learned
trial judge ordered that this count be divided into 235 separate counts which
are set out in his judgment and in that of the Court of Queen's Bench. The
first of these reads as follows:—

3.-1. Le ou vers le 31 mai
1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs donc Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The remaining 234 counts were
similarly worded except as to date and amount; the last charged an offence
committed on May 9, 1960.

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

While the printed record consists
of many volumes the relevant facts may be stated comparatively briefly.

In May, 1940, the respondent was
appointed Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police at a yearly salary of $4,000; in
August, 1941, this was increased to $4,500. In 1952 the respondent applied for
an increase in salary to the then Solicitor-General who referred the matter to
Mr. Duplessis who was then both Attorney-General and Prime Minister. Mr.
Duplessis told the Solicitor-General that an enquiry was going on before the
Civil Service Commission into the question of raising the salaries of the
Quebec Liquor Police and of civil servants in general and that if he granted
the respondent an increase he would immediately be pressed with requests by
others and then said words to the following effect:

Vous direz à Lemire, ou vous
lui ferez dire que je l'autorise à retirer cinquante piastres ($50.00) par
mois, à titre de frais de représentation, ou de dépenses,

The evidence of the Solicitor-General
continued:

De retour à mon
bureau, j'ai dit à Lemire — je ne sais pas si c'est à lui personnellement ou si
c'est peut-être à Côté, ma mémoire n'est pas assez fidèle pour vous l'affirmer
que je l'ai dit à lui — mais je sais qu'il l'a su, ou à son adjoint, qui était
Wellie Côté, que le Procureur Général l'autorisait à retirer mensuellement un
montant de cinquante dollars ($50.00) à titre de frais de représentation, et
que dans le fond, était pour tenir lieu d'une augmentation de salaire qui
s'élevait à six cents piastres ($600.00) par année.

[Page 178]

The substance of this
conversation was communicated to the respondent by Wellie Côté who had been
appointed associate director of the Quebec Liquor Police in January, 1951, and
of whom Tremblay C.J. says that unofficially he was the respondent's superior.
At this time Côté handed the respondent a cheque of the Québec Liquor Police
for $50. Some days later Côté presented a document to the respondent for
signature. This was a printed form partially filled in in typewriting. The
following phrase was type-written:

Déplacement et frais de
séjour pour surveillance du travail.

Several blank spaces in the form
intended for the insertion of details were left blank. Above the signature of
the respondent appeared the following certificate:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The form did not specify any
""cause"". It was dated ""May"".

Thereafter from time to time Côté
presented the respondent with a cheque and a similar form which the respondent
signed and in this manner the respondent received amounts totalling $50 a month
until the form dated February 17, 1953, was returned to the respondent marked
""annulé"".

On receipt of this the respondent
went to the office of the Provincial Auditor and had an interview with an
employee. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence of their conversation was
inadmissible and we do not know what was said between them. The question
whether this evidence was rightly excluded is not before us, and consequently,
I express no opinion on it.

Following this interview the
forms signed by the respondent were filled up in detail, specifying the place
visited, the hotel at which respondent stayed, the amount paid for railway fare
and the price paid for meals. There appears to be no doubt that a large number
of these forms were entirely false in fact and described trips which the respondent
had not taken.

In the year 1954 Côté advised the
respondent that he was authorized to draw $100 a month in this manner instead
of $50. This practice continued until May, 1960, when the respondent's annual
salary was increased to 

[Page 179]

$7,400 and he ceased to withdraw
any further sums in augmentation of his salary.

The learned trial judge finds as
a fact that the authorization to withdraw the sum of $50 was given orally by
the Attorney-General and communicated to the respondent but concluded as a
matter of law that it was ""nulle, de nullité absolue"". He goes on to
hold that the respondent could not have had an honest belief that he was
entitled to obtain the moneys which he did obtain by rendering expense accounts
which were false in fact. He finds as a fact that the great majority of the
expense accounts signed by the respondent were false and fictitious but does
not specify which particular ones were false and finds that about twice a year
the respondent went on trips of inspection in connection with which he would
have been entitled to receive his expenses. He does not make an express finding
as to whether Côté told the respondent he was authorized to draw $100 monthly
instead of $50. At the time of the trial both the Attorney-General and Côté had
died.

The respondent appealed against
his convictions. On October 1, 1962, the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side,
granted him leave to appeal on questions of fact.

The appeal was heard by a Court
composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ. The appeal was
allowed and it was directed that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts
on which he had been convicted. All the members of the Court reached the same
result but each gave separate reasons.

On October 2, 1963, leave was
granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court on the following three questions:

1. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 592(1)  (a) de Code Criminel  du Canada?

2. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré si elle a ignoré les lois gouvernant la
manipulation et la dépense des deniers publics et a-t-elle mal interprété les
lois applicables dans l'espéce?

3. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 323(1)  du Code Criminel ?

This leave was granted pursuant
to s. 598(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . Authority is not required for the
wellsettled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal is limited to
questions of law in the strict sense.

[Page 180]

It is clear from the judgment of
this Court in The Queen v. Warner[4],
that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which
one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this
Court must be dismissed.

I am satisfied that in the case
at bar the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of
mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense.

Tremblay C.J. holds that as to
the first 17 counts, in regard to which the certificates signed by the
respondent named no ""cause"" and gave no details, the money was paid
over to the respondent before he signed the certificates which constituted
rather receipts for money paid than demands for payment and that no one was in
fact deceived or induced to pay over the money by any representation on the
part of the respondent. This is a finding of fact or, at the highest from the
point of view of the appellant, a mixed finding of fact and law.

As to the remainder of the counts
the learned Chief Justice expresses himself as follows:

Quant aux autres
chefs, entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révéle hors de
tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admisque certains frais inscrits sur les
formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais il résulte aussi de la
preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces
frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du
doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur
ce point révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du
temps. Les témoins admettent cependant
qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par année. L'appelant a retrouvé deux formules
qui contenaient des frais réellement encourus. Il a juré qu'il y en avait
sûrement d'autres mais que sa mémoire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer
après tant d'années. Il faut dire que l'appelant était âgé de 74 ans lors de
son témoignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne,
me paraît nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs,
le premier juge a acquitté l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu
préciser. De son propre chef, il a retranché du montant allégué dans d'autres
chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit
de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il
résulte que, même si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalité entre le
paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du procureur général a d'ailleurs
franchement admis

[Page 181]

lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

This appears to me to be a
finding of fact. The learned Chief Justice has considered the evidence and
reached the conclusion that it does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt,
the guilt of the accused upon any of the counts on which he was convicted. I
find it impossible to say that the question whether he was right in reaching
this conclusion is one of law in the strict sense.

TASCHEREAU J. delivered the
following reasons:

Les faits révélés par la
preuve et qu'ont exposés M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Casey démontrent que
de graves irrégularités ont été commises par l'appelant. Mais la question vitale est celle de savoir si
Lemire, un homme maintenant âgé de 74 ans qui a été directeur de la police des
liqueurs à Québec, pendant vingt ans, avait l'intention coupable de frauder le
public et le gouvernement de la Province de Québec, lorsqu'il a posé les actes
qu'on lui reproche.

L'étude du dossier m'a convaincu
qu'il fallait répondre négativement â cette question. Aussi, commes mes
collègues, j'accueillerais l'appel et libérerais l'accusé:

The first paragraph accurately
states a question which the Court of Appeal was called upon to answer. It
involves an inquiry into the respondent's state of mind. The state of a man's
mind is, in the often quoted words of Bowen L.J., as much a fact as the state
of his digestion; vide Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5].
The decision of Taschereau J. to allow the appeal appears to me to be based on
a finding of fact certainly it cannot be said that the sole ground on which he
has proceeded is a question of law in the strict sense.

From this it appears that a
majority of the Court of Appeal, in quashing the convictions, have proceeded on
grounds which this Court has no power to review and it follows that the appeal
must be dismissed.

Having reached this conclusion it
becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether it could be said that the
judgment of Casey J. was based only on grounds which this Court has
jurisdiction to review and I express no opinion on that question.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 182]

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The material facts
involved in this case are not in dispute. At all relevant times the respondent
Lemire (hereinafter referred to as ""Lemire"") was the Chief of the
Quebec Liquor Police. There was an Associate Chief, one Wellie Côté, who was in
fact, though not in name, the real head of the force. In the year 1952 Lemire
applied to the Solicitor-General of Quebec for an increase in his salary, which was then $4,500
per annum. The Solicitor-General referred the application to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Duplessis, who was then also the Prime Minister of the Province. The
latter, while he approved of an increase for Lemire, was not prepared to grant
it, because it might provoke other similar requests, and the whole salary
structure of the Quebec civil service was then under review. He told the
Solicitor-General to tell Lemire that he would authorize Lemire to draw $50 per
month by way of expenses. This information was communicated to Lemire by Côté.

I agree with Casey J. in the
Court[6] below
when he says that the instructions given by the Attorney-General necessarily
implied the making of fictitious expense accounts.

Lemire commenced, in May, 1952,
to put in expense accounts, initially for $50 per month and then, commencing on
July 15, 1952, for $25 for each half month, represented to be for ""Frais
de déplacement et de séjour pour surveillance du travail."" Each of these
expense accounts contained the following certificate, signed by Lemire:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The expense account dated
February 14, 1953, was returned to Lemire, by the Provincial Auditor's
Department, marked ""annulé"". Lemire then saw an employee of that
Department who is unkown. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence by Lemire
as to his interview with the employee was not admissible. In any event Lemire
filed an expense account, dated February
 15, 1953, purporting to contain the
details of his expenditures, totalling $25.

[Page 183]

Thereafter, until the beginning
of the year 1954, he proceeded to file two, and occasionally three, expense
accounts each month, appearing to contain items of expenditure which he had
incurred, each one of which contained the certificate previously quoted. Each
of these was for an odd amount and not for an even $25.

Early in the year 1954 Lemire
says that he was advised by Côté that his monthly expense accounts could be
increased to $100. At the time of the trial Côté was dead. Evidence was given
by the former Solicitor-General that he was unaware of any authority having
been given for any increase beyond the initial, fixed amount of $50 per month.
Commencing in 1954, Lemire's total expense accounts rendered each month became
larger. In most instances two accounts were filed in each month, although on
some occasions there would be three or more.

This practice continued until the
year 1960, when Lemire received a salary increase to $7,400 per annum.
Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased.

The procedure respecting expense
accounts was that two forms were required to be filed, one white and one
yellow, the latter being retained in the office of the Liquor Police. The white
one, signed by the person seeking payment of expenses, had to be verified by
the accountant of the Liquor Police, was then forwarded to the Department of
the Attorney-General and, from there, was transmitted to the office of the
Provincial Auditor for approval. Section 17 of the Provincial Audit Act,
R.S.Q. 1941, c.72, required that such accounts be examined and that it be
ascertained that the payments charged be supported by voucher.

It is clear, from this brief
outline of the facts, the material portions of which are admitted by Lemire,
that, over a period of years, he submitted expense accounts which he knew to be
false and obtained payment out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec of those amounts which were claimed in the expense accounts.

Lemire was charged under s.
323(1)  of the Criminal Code , which provides:

323. (1) Every one who, by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false
pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person,
whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security, is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

[Page 184]

The learned trial judge required
that the original count, which had charged Lemire with defrauding the public
and, in particular, the Government of the Province of Quebec, of the sum of $8,999.10,
be divided into 235 separate counts, each dealing with one expense account.

Count No. 1 will serve as an
example of the form in which these various charges were made:

1. le ou vers le 31
mai 1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs dont Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

Lemire's appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[7], was
allowed by unanimous decision. The Court was composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and
Casey and Taschereau JJ., each of whom gave separate reasons.

As to the first 17 counts, which
dealt with those expense accounts rendered by Lemire prior to and including
that dated February 14, 1953, which was annulled by the Auditor-General, Tremblay
C.J. says:

Pour ces 17 premiers
cas, l'appelant témoigne, et il n'est pas contredit, que les chèques lui
étaient remis soit avant, soit au moment même où on lui demandait de signer les
formules. Ce ne sont donc pas les
représentations contenues dans ces formules qui ont amené le consentement au
paiement. C'était un reçu que l'appelant signait plutôt qu'une demande de
paiement.

De plus, il ne me paraît pas
raisonnable de croire que quelqu'un ait pu être trompé par ces formules. Bien
que la partie imprimée de la formule l'exigeât, aucune date de départ ou de
retour, aucun détail des supposés frais ne sont donnés. Le certificat qui réfère à «l'intérêt de cette cause»
n'a pu tromper personne puisqu'aucune cause n'est mentionnée. ll manque donc un
élément de l'offense: le lien de causalité entre le consentement au paiement et
les représentations de l'appelant. ll est possible que ceux qui ont payé
n'avaient pas le pouvoir de disposer ainsi des fonds publics, mais il y aurait
alors recours civil en répétition de l'indû mais non crime de fraude.

L'on dira peut-être
que ce raisonnement est exact quant au «gouvernement de la province de Québec»
mais non quant «au public en général» que l'appelant est aussi accusé d'avoir «fraudé».
Si l'on considère le public indépendamment de son mandataire, le gouvernement
de la province, il faut décider que, si l'appelant est coupable d'un crime, ce
n'est pas de

[Page 185]

celui de fraude,
parce que le public n'a jamais consenti au paiement et que le consentement de
la personne frustrée est un élément essentiel du crime de fraude.

With respect, I think it is an
error in law to construe the forms signed by Lemire as being receipts, rather
than demands for payment, merely because, according to his evidence, after the
first occasion, the signed form was handed him by Côté at the same time that he
received the cheque from Côté. The cheques which were delivered by Côté were
drawn on the account of the Liquor Police. They were signed by Côté, as
director, and also by the accountant of the Liquor Police. They represented
payments from public funds, which, admittedly, could only be validly justified
by proper vouchers, and these Côté had to obtain. Expense moneys were payable
only on the basis of a certified statement of actual expense. Each such
statement had to be verified and thereafter to be approved by the Auditor-General.
It is obvious that Lemire could not have continued to receive the cheques
without having provided the false statements which were the basis for their
issuance. The scheme must be examined as a whole and, when that is done, there
is no question but that false expense accounts were submitted by Lemire as a
basis for his receipt of public funds. This constitutes the ""lien de
causalite"" between the vouchers and the payments which the learned Chief
Justice felt was lacking in this case.

It is suggested that no one was
deceived by these expense accounts because they did not contain a detailed list
of the expenditures as contemplated by the form. To say this is to say either that
the persons required by law to check the forms were themselves also parties to
the fraud, or that they failed to perform their duties properly. However, even
if this be so, and whichever is the case, this does not provide Lemire with an
answer in law to the charges under s. 323(1) . Whether or not they deceived the
people who were supposed to check and verify them, the point is that, without
filing of the expense accounts, the payments to Lemire from public funds could
not have been obtained or continued. Section 323(1) , in addition to mentioning
deceit and falsehood, also refers to ""other fraudulent means"".
Whether or not they deceived the people who saw them, they were the necessary
means used to obtain the payments and without them the payments would not have

[Page 186]

been made. They were fraudulent.
In my opinion the ground taken in the second paragraph above quoted is wrong in
law.

In the third paragraph of the
passage above quoted it is said that the public was not defrauded because the
public never consented to the payment. There is here an error in law. The
public, through its elected representatives, had consented to the expenditure
of public funds only on the basis of compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures. In my opinion any one who, by fraudulently purporting to fulfill
those requirements, obtained payment of public moneys, to which he was not
lawfully entitled, would thereby have defrauded the public within the meaning
of s. 323(1) .

I find it impossible to see how,
on the uncontradicted evidence of Lemire himself, any other conclusion can be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, I do not see how any
other conclusion in law can be reached save that he had defrauded the
Provincial Government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained.

In this connection the reasoning
of Cartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of this Court in Cox
and Paton v. The Queen[8],
is relevant. In that case the accused were charged with having conspired to
commit an indictable offence; i.e., by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited. It was contended in argument that
there was no evidence that any official of that company had been deceived,
particularly as the president of the company and its controlling shareholder
was fully aware of all that was being done by the accused. Dealing with this
argument, Cartwright J., at p. 512, said:

In the course of argument on
this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was
no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they
intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false
representation made to the company or of any official of the company have been
deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished.
Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the
meaning of s. 597(1)  of the Criminal Code ,, I would reject this
argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to
the $200,000 which is the first item in the particulars. I have already
indicated my agreement with the statement of Freedman J.A.

[Page 187]

that ""implicit in the
entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a
legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to
make"" and with his view that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding
that this representation was false to the knowledge of the accused. If it
deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at least in control of the company
into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that would be a fraud on the company.
If, on the other hand, it is suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid
the money over knowing that the transaction was not bona fide, that the
Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a
scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with
its own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps
criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds
to purchase an asset which they know to be worthless as part of a scheme to
divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under
s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be
said that, the directors being ""the mind of the company"" and well
knowing the true facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I
should find it difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case
the directors would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood,
by ""other fraudulent means"".

As to the expense accounts
submitted after February 14, 1953, the learned Chief Justice says:

Quant aux autres chefs,
entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révèle
hors de tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admis—que certains frais inscrits
sur les formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais, il résulte aussi
de la preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun
de ces frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer
du doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur ce point
révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du temps. Les

du montant allégué dans d'autres chefs les frais du permis de conduire de
l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il

paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du
procureur général a d'ailleurs franchement admis lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun chef n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

[Page 188]

Before this Court, counsel for
the appellant impressed upon us that there must have been a misunderstanding
with respect to the admission referred to in the last paragraph, in the passage
above quoted, as having been made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Counsel
before us advised that he did not think that such an admission had been made.
It certainly had not been intended to make any such admission on behalf of the
Crown, and the record would not support the making of it.

In my opinion the conclusion
reached in this passage is also wrong. Lemire was asked, in his evidence, to
indicate which of the expense accounts in evidence represented expenditures
really incurred by him. He was able to identify only two. The following is the
evidence which he gave in chief in this connection:

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Alors, en somme,
monsieur Lemire, dans cette période, allant de mai, mil neuf cent-cinquante-deux
(1952), à mai, mil neuf cent-soixante (1960), vous dites que vous avez été
autorisé à recevoir cinquante dollars ($50.00) par mois jusqu'en mil neuf cent
cinquante-quatre (1954)?

R. Oui.

Q. C'est-à-dire huit (8)
mois en mil neuf cent cinquante-deux (1952), c'est ça?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et douze (12) mois, en
mil neuf cent cinquante-trois?

R. Oui.

Q. Ce qui fait vingt (20)
mois à cinquante dollars ($50.00), soit mille dollars ($1,000.00)?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et ce que vous
dites, c'est qu'à partir de mil neuf cent cinquante-quatre (1954), jusqu'à mil
neuf cent soixante (1960), c'était cent dollars ($100.00) par mois?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Est-ce que vous pourriez
nous dire, effectivement, combien vous avez pris sur ces montants-là, pendant
cette période-là?

R. Bien, je calcule que je dois
avoir pris entre huit mille (8,000) et huit mille six cents piastres
($8,600.00).

Q. Je comprends également
qu'il y a des comptes de dépenses, pour plus ce montant là?

R. Absolument.

Q. Comment expliquez-vous
cette difference-là?

R. Bien ça, je ne peux pas
le dire, parce que j'ai fait des voyages, et dans les comptes, je ne les ai pas
vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
voulez dire que la différence représenterait vos dépenses réelles?

R. Oui.

[Page 189]

Q. Et, vous avez dit tout à
l'heure que vous êtes même d'opinion qu'il en manque des comptes de dépenses?

R. Je le crois.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Seriez-vous
capable, en examinant chacun des exhibits, nous dire si vous ne pourriez pas
reconnaître des comptes, pour des dépenses que vous auriez réellement faites
pour des voyages?

R. Bien, j'ai
regardé avec Me Letarte, j'en ai vu une couple.

D'autre part, j'ai des
comptes qui ont été faits pour des voyages, et je ne les ai pas vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
pourriez m'indiquer ceux-là que vous avez vus?

Si vous avez besoin d'un
ajournement pour examiner les comptes attentivement, je vais vous permettre de
le faire.

R. On les a examinés tous
les deux.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Moi, je ne peux pas
témoigner.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Mais, vous m'avez dit, si
j'ai bien compris, que dans les exhibits produits, il y en aurait deux (2) que
vous avez reconnus comme représentant des dépenses que vous auriez réellement
faites à l'occasion de voyages?

R. Oui.

Q. Pour le bénéfice de la
Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Q. Alors, pourriez-vous les
indiquer à la Cour, dans les exhibits, ces deux-là?

R. Oui, il y a un
voyage en Gaspésie, je pense, au commencement de septembre, mil neuf cent
cinquante-neuf (1959).

Q. Il s'agit de quel
exhibit?

PAR LE GREFFIER:

P.-221.

PAR LE TÉMOIN:

R. Oui, quarante-deux
piastres et trent-cinq ($42.35).

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Ce sont des dépenses
réelles que vous avez assumées pour du travail à la Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Et il y en a un autre, je me
rappelle pas de la date, c'est un voyage aux environs de La Tuque et Berthier.

PAR Me LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, voici à part
ces deux voyages-là, voulez-vous dire qu'intégralement . . .

PAR LA COUR:

J'aimerais bien qu'on le
retrace avant de clore la Défense; j'aimerais bien qu'on le retrace.

[Page 190]

PAR Me RENÉ
LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Ce serait en quelle
année, çà, celui-là en particulier?

R. Je me rappelle
pas, je ne sais pas si c'est en cinquante-six (56), ou en cinquante-sept (57),
c'est pas mal loin en arrière.

Q. Est-ce qu'il y
aurait eu une note particulière, sur ce compte-là?

R. Oui, il y aurait eu le
nom de Letarte et de Laforest, dessus.

PAR LE GREFFIER:

Alors, ce serait P.-38.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. C'est ça, P.-38, en
novembre, mil neuf cent cinquante-trois (1953)?

R. Oui, pour un montant de
vingt-neuf et vingt-cinq ($29.25).

Q. Alors, ça, ce sont deux
comptes, dans les comptes auxquels vous venez de référer, pour lesquels vous
vous souvenez positivement qu'il s'agit intégralement de dépenses réelles?

R. Absolument.

Q. Maintenant, dans les
autres cas, dans les autres comptes, qu'est-ce qu'il y a là-dedans?

R. C'est parce qu'on a fait
un voyage à Saint-Hilaire, aussi, dans le temps, c'est près de Beloeil, ça.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Dans le comté de Rouville?

R. Oui.

Ensuite, j'en ai fait à Chicoutimi.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, est-ce que
des comptes séparés et distincts étaient faits pour ces autres voyages-là, ou
bien non, si vos dépenses étaient dissimulées dans d'autres comptes?

R. Je ne faisais pas de
distinction, des fois je le marquais dans le mois, avec l'autre, là.

Q. Vous mêliez ça ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Et ce que nous allons
appeler votre allocation, et les dépenses réelles qui vous étaient occasionnées
dans le mois?

R. Absolument.

Q. C'était fondu ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Maintenant, vous dites
que, toutefois, dans cette liste-là, il y a deux cas où ce sont des comptes
réellement distincts pour des voyages en particulier?

R. Oui.

This evidence can be summarized
as follows:

1. Of the expense accounts which
were exhibits, Lemire could identify only two as representing genuine expenses.

2. He thought there were other
expense accounts which

[Page 191]

he had submitted which were not
included among the exhibits at the trial.

3. He thought that some of the
expense accounts which were exhibits, apart from the two which he had
specifically identified, included both real and false expenses mingled
together.

To say that, on this evidence, a
reasonable doubt exists as to Lemire's guilt on each and every charge is, in my
view, wrong in law.

In the first place, Lemire does
not appear to go any further in relation to the expense accounts, other than
the two which he identified, than to say that some of them may have contained a
mixture of real and false expenditures. Even accepting this evidence, it would
be wrong in law to hold that he was entitled to an acquittal in respect of an
expense account which contained some real expenditures as well as false
expenditures merely because the amount charged in the count would then be
larger, by the amount of the real expenditures, than the amount which he
actually obtained by fraud. To hold that, in such a case, Lemire was entitled
to an acquittal is an error in law.

In the second place, the
conclusion of the learned Chief Justice as to the existence of a reasonable
doubt on all counts has no basis on the evidence. Lemire admitted that the
express purpose of filing the expense accounts was. in order to obtain payments
to him equivalent to $50 per month, and later $100 per month. An examination of
the total of the accounts rendered for each month and also for each year
establishes, beyond peradventure, that in practically every month, from 1952 to
1960, inclusive, a part, if not the whole, of each account rendered represented
expenses not actually incurred. An example will illustrate the point which I am
seeking to make. In October, 1954, after Lemire had increased his expense
account payments from $50 to $100 per month, he rendered two expense accounts,
one on October 8 for $48.90, another on October 22 for $53.25, making a total
for the month of $102.15. This total exceeds the $100 which he was seeking to
obtain in lieu of salary increase by only $2.15. Each of the two expense
accounts was for more than that amount. Similarly, in the following month of
November three accounts were 

[Page 192]

rendered, one on November 8 for
$35.90, one on November 20 for $41.90, one on November 25 for $29.10, making a
total of $106.90. In December the monthly total was $76.50, made up of two
accounts, one on December 4 for $33.85, the second on December 16 for $42.65.
In view of Lemire's own admission as to the basic purpose for which the
accounts were rendered, it seems to me to be impossible to conclude that any
one of these seven accounts mentioned related only to expenditures genuinely
incurred. This illustration could be repeated many times.

With the exception of those
counts on which Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on
the basis of which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any
doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire's having
incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were
fictitious and false.

In my opinion, on an appeal from
a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that
certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of
creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error in law.

I turn now to the reasons given
by Casey J., who said:

Despite what is said in the
judgment and in respondent's factum, the facts of this case are crystal clear
and surprisingly simple. Appellant wanted an increase and the one who
controlled every aspect of the Government's business and certainly that of
appellant's department, the Attorney General and Prime Minister, felt that his
request was a legitimate one and that it should be granted. But there was a fly
in the ointment. An enquiry into the government's salary structure was under
way and it would have been embarrassing to grant an increase at that moment. In
fact ""that moment"" dragged on and on and the results of the enquiry
were given effect only in November of 1959. So the means above described were
devised.

Without commenting on the
propriety or prevalence of this method of granting disguised salary increases,
and without asking why appellant's situation was not regularized post factum, I
give it as my view that in the circumstances obtaining throughout this whole
period appellant was entitled to believe that for reasons of higher policy he
was given an increase in this fashion and that the procedure, irregular though
it may have been on its face, could and would in the fullness of time be
ratified and validated. After all he was dealing with the person who gave the
orders, and who had—""l'autorité pour augmenter ou diminuer les
salaires"".

Since the instructions given
by the Attorney General necessarily implied the making of fictitious expense
accounts I am unable to find in appellant the intention to defraud contemplated
by the Criminal Code , nor since we are dealing with a salary increase
that his superiors considered 

[Page 193]

warranted, am I able to see
in what respect the public or the Province was defrauded.

The effect of the second
paragraph, above quoted, may be rather bluntly summarized in this way. Because
the augmentation of Lemire's income by the filing of false expense accounts was
suggested and approved by the Attorney-General and Prime Minister of the
Province, Lemire, who deliberately filed false documents and thereby obtained
payments from the provincial public funds, could not be held guilty of fraud,
because he could reasonably anticipate that the fraudulent system would later
be somehow validated. In other words, there is no intent to defraud within the
requirement of s. 323(1)  if the accused person, while deliberately committing
an act which is clearly fraudulent, expects that that which he is doing may, at
a later date, be validated. To me the very statement of this proposition
establishes its error in law.

Incidentally, it may be noted
that when, in 1960, Lemire's salary was increased, no attempt was made to
validate his receipt of the moneys paid to him on the basis of the false
expense accounts in the preceding years.

The implication of the third
paragraph is that, because the suggestion for the proposed fraudulent method
emanated from the Attorney-General of the Province, Lemire, who was the one who
deliberately certified the fraudulent expense accounts, could not be found to
have intended to defraud and, further, that because his superiors thought
Lemire was entitled to a salary increase (which they would not grant), a
fraudulent scheme for the obtaining of payment of fictitious expense accounts
did not constitute a fraud on the public.

To me the idea that it is an
answer to a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior
of the accused is completely erroneous in law, as is also the proposition that
the Province of Quebec and the public of Quebec were not defrauded by paying,
out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely because Lemire's salary was
less than what he and his superiors thought it ought to be.

In conclusion, with respect to
the reasons given by the learned judges to which I have referred, it appears to
me that, while each of them contains findings which, viewed in isolation,
might, at first glance, be regarded as findings of 

[Page 194]

fact, or of mixed fact and law,
each judgment is palpably based on a misconception of the effect of s. 323(1) 
of the Criminal Code . We have, in this case, an accused person who
admits to having obtained, out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec, between $8,000 and $8,600 and, for that purpose, to have rendered
certified expense accounts which were fictitious. These facts are not in
dispute. In the reasons given in the Court below, which I have reviewed,
certain inferences have been drawn from the facts in evidence, but the
fundamental error which exists in each, and which is an error in law, is in
holding that, on the basis of those inferences, some element in the offence was
lacking.

In Belyea and Weinraub v. The
King[9],
this Court considered a case in which the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Ontario had allowed an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal by the
trial court in proceedings by indictment. The right of appeal to the Appellate
Division was limited, as is the appellant's right to appeal to this Court in
the present case, to questions of law. It was contended by the appellants in
that case that the issues before the Appellate Division did not involve a
question of law alone. Chief Justice Anglin, who delivered the judgment of the
Court, said at p. 296:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to
""questions of law"". That implies, if it means anything at all, that
there can be no attack by him in the Appellate
 Divisional Court on the correctness of
any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding
the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law
and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does
here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or
the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion,
since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially
where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the
learned trial judge.

In my opinion, the guilt of the
respondent in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found,
or inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of
which, for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no
ground not involving such questions upon which Lemire's appeal could have been
allowed. There was, therefore, a right of appeal to this Court and the appeal
should succeed. The judgment of the learned trial judge, with respect to the
question of guilt, should be restored.

[Page 195]

Lemire also appealed against
sentence, but, in view of the conclusions there reached, no decision was
rendered on this point by the Court below. The case should therefore, be
returned to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, to deal with the appeal
from sentence.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

1                    
On 19 July 1999 I gave leave for the applicant
to file and serve a further draft amended statement of claim and adjourned to
27 September 1999 in the first instance, motions by the first, second, third,
fourth and sixth respondents to strike out the then extant version of the
applicant’s amended Statement of Claim. 
In the reasons for making those orders I traced the convoluted history
of the litigation to that point.  The
present reasons should be read in conjunction with those reasons and the
earlier reasons published on 12 May 1995. 
The draft further amended statement of claim filed in compliance with
the order of 19 July 1999 has, for convenience, been dated 27 September 1999
and is hereafter called “the substituted statement of claim”.

The structure of the substituted statement of claim

2                    
As in the statement of claim considered on 19
July 1999, the substituted statement of claim identifies in its introductory
paragraphs the applicant (“Elliott”) and the various respondents and describes
the composition of the Inter-Governmental Committee (“IGC”) established
pursuant to s 8 of the National
Crime Authority Act 1984 (“the Act”). 
Paragraphs 9 to 46 comprise largely a chronological narrative commencing
with a request by the National Crime Authority (“the NCA”) for a matter
relating to alleged relevant criminal activity to be referred to the NCA for
investigation.  Various notices, the
“Bowen, Crabb and First Sumner Notices” are alleged to have been issued each
purporting to refer to the NCA for investigation a matter relating to an
alleged criminal activity.  It is then
pleaded in paras 23 and 24 of the substituted statement of claim:

“23.     Each of the Bowen, Crabb and First Sumner
Notices was made for a purpose other than the purpose for which the power to
make a Notice was conferred, being one or more of the following purposes:



(a)        discrediting
the Applicant;



(b)       causing electoral disadvantage to the
Liberal Party in the 1990 Federal election;



(c)        giving an electoral advantage to the
Australian Labor Party in the 1990 Federal election.”





24.       The alleged relevant criminal activity
the subject of each of the Bowen, Crabb and First Sumner Notices was the manner
in which Harlin and directors of EXL had obtained control of EXL.”



3                    
Paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 introduce what have
become known as “the Forex Transactions” and are cast in the following terms:

“26.     In about January and September 1988 EXL
made payments to the Bank of New Zealand Ltd (BNZ) (the Payments).



PARTICULARS



(a)       On about 11 January 1988 a payment was
made by EXL to BNZ and a subsequent payment was made by BNZ to a company or
companies associated with Allan Robert Hawkins (Hawkins) and/or Equiticorp
Tasman Ltd (ETL) in the sum of about $39.5 million;  and



(b)       On about 7 September 1988 a payment was made
by EXL to BNZ and a subsequent payment was made by BNZ to a company or
companies associated with Hawkins and/or ETL of about $27 million.



27.       The Payments were recorded and described
in the relevant books of account of EXL as payments made in settlement of
foreign exchange transactions (the Forex Transactions).



28.       The Payments were not genuinely in
settlement of foreign exchange transactions.



PARTICULARS



The Payments were made to discharge
an obligation of EXL owed to ETL.”



4                    
Reference is then made to further notices (“the
First Sandon Notice”, “the Second Sandon Notice”, “the Duffy Notice” and “the
Second Sumner Notice”), purporting to refer to the NCA for investigation
certain alleged relevant criminal activity. 
It is next alleged in para 44:

“Each of the First Sandon, Second Sandon, Duffy and Second
Sumner Notices was procured by the NCA for one or more of the following
purposes:



(a)       discrediting the
Applicant;



(b)       obtaining evidence for use by the New
Zealand Securities Commission (NZSC);



(c)        obtaining evidence for use by the New
Zealand Serious Fraud Office (NZSFO);



(d)       obtaining evidence for use by the
Statutory Managers of ETL (SMETL).”



5                    
Paragraphs 47 to 52 of the substituted
statement of claim allege, under the heading “Scope of the Notices” that, when they were issued, the Notices did
not, and were not intended to, include the Forex Transactions and, if valid,
did not refer the Forex Transactions to the NCA for special investigation.  In paras 53 to 58 it is alleged that the
Notices contravened, or did not comply in certain respects with, requirements
of the Act and of relevant Victorian and South Australian legislation and a
consequence is pleaded, in para 56, to be that each of the Notices “was and is invalid and incapable of
authorising the NCA to use its Coercive Powers” and that “none of the Notices authorised a special
investigation into the Forex Transactions.” 


6                    
Under the heading “Negligence of NCA concerning Notices” paras 58 to 62 impute
to the NCA certain actual or constructive knowledge in consequence of which it
is said to have owed a duty of care to Elliott. 
In breach of that duty of care, it is alleged in para 61, the NCA
did not take reasonable care to ensure that statements and representations made
by it to Duffy, the IGC, Sandon and Sumner were accurate, true or not
misleading and did not inform them of certain matters set out in para 60
including the intended scope of the Bowen Notice, and the fact that the NCA had
already used Coercive Powers to:

“i)        investigate the Forex Transactions;

ii)         attempt to discredit the Applicant;

iii)        obtain evidence for use by the NZSC;

iv)        obtain evidence for use by the NZSFO;

v)         obtain evidence for use by the SMETL;”

and proposed to continue to use the Coercive Powers for
those purposes.  

7                    
It is then pleaded in para 62 that, in
consequence of the breach of duty alleged in para 61, the applicant has
suffered loss and damage.  Extensive
so-called particulars of that loss and damage, including legal costs and
expenses exceeding $2 million and loss of business opportunities said to amount
in value to millions of dollars are appended to that paragraph.  

8                    
Under the heading “NCA Summonses and Hearings”, paras 63 to 84 of the
substituted statement of claim set out in chronological order allegations touching
the issue of summonses pursuant to s 28 of the Act and the applicant’s
attendance in response to those summonses. 
The allegations in para 44 in relation to the Notices identified in
that paragraph are mirrored in respect of the summonses by para 80 which
alleges:

“Each of Summonses MS46 and MS94 was issued for a purpose other
than the purpose for which the power in section 28 of the Act was conferred,
being one or more of the following purposes:



(a)        investigating
the Forex Transactions;



(b)        discrediting
the Applicant;



(c)        obtaining
evidence for use of the NZSC;



(d)        obtaining
evidence for use of the NZSFO;



(e)        obtaining
evidence for use by the SMETL.”

9                    
It is then alleged in para 81 that each of “the First, the Second and the Third
Hearings was convened” for an ulterior purpose being one or more of the
purposes asserted in sub-paras 80(a) to (e).  Paragraphs 82 to 84 plead the consequential
unlawfulness of the issue of the summonses and the convening of the hearings
and the resultant invalidity of each of the summonses.  Paragraphs 85 to 89 allege that either or
both Mr Leckie (a member of the NCA) and the NCA were negligent in issuing the
summonses by asserting that, because of knowledge of various matters imputed to
them, they owed a duty of care to the applicant which was breached because; as
alleged in para 87:

“(a)     [They] did
not take reasonable care to ensure that the Summonses contained sufficient
information to ensure that the Applicant knew of the matters enumerated (i) to
(iv) in paragraph 86(a) above or that he was able to exercise his rights under
section 30 of the Act.”



“(b)     The Summonses were not accompanied by the
Bowen, the Crabb, the First Sandon and the First Sumner Notices.”



10                 
Sub-joined to para 88 are what are called
“particulars” of the loss and damage allegedly suffered as a result of the
breach of the duty of care alleged in para 87.  Those particulars are in the following terms:

“(a)     Had the Applicant been properly informed of
the matters referred to in paragraph 86(a)(i) to (iv) he would not have given
evidence by exercising his rights under section 30 of the Act.



(b)       The NCA relied upon the Applicant’s
evidence to support the laying of the Charges against him and their
prosecution.



(c)        In the absence of that evidence the Applicant
would not have been threatened with criminal charges and subsequently charged
and prosecuted.



(d)       The Applicant refers to sub-paragraph
2(c) of the particulars under paragraph 62 above.”



11                 
In paras 90 to 91 a similar duty of care
said to have been owed to the applicant is imputed to either or both Mr Leckie
and the NCA in conducting the First Hearing. 
A breach of that duty is alleged in para 92 in these terms:

“In breach of the duty of care alleged in paragraph 91 above,
Leckie and/or the NCA did not take reasonable care to ensure that the Applicant
was provided with the information to ensure that the Applicant knew of the
matters enumerated in paragraphs 91(a) to (d) above and that he was able to
exercise his rights under section 30 of the Act.”

Particulars of the loss and damage flowing from that alleged
breach of a duty of care are said to be the same as those appended to
para 88.

12                 
A further set of allegations is to be found in
paras 95 to 100 under the heading “Negligence
of Leckie, Livermore [an officer of the NCA] and NCA concerning Disclosure of
Secret Information.”  Those
paragraphs allege that documents, evidence and other confidential information
concerning Elliott’s business was obtained by the use of the NCA’s Coercive
Powers and that, because Leckie, Livermore and the NCA had actual or
constructive knowledge of the nature of that information and the consequences
of its disclosure, they owed a duty of care to the applicant:

“(a)     to maintain the confidentiality of such of
the Information as was provided by the Applicant;



(b)       to maintain the confidentiality of all
the Information;



(c)        to provide the Applicant with an
opportunity, in advance of the disclosure of any of the Information, to make
representations for the purpose of maintaining the confidentiality of the
Information;



(d)       to ensure that any disclosure of the
Information to any other person was:



(i)        authorised by the Act or otherwise;



(ii)       made only for the purposes of the Act;



(iii)      made only in connection with the
performance of a duty under the Act.”



13                 
Various breaches of one or more of those duties
of care are then alleged in para 98 to which the following particulars
have been subjoined:

“(1)     In and after May 1990 Leckie, Livermore
and/or the NCA made the Information available to the NZSC, the NZSFO and SMETL.



(2)       None of the NZSC, NZSFO or SMETL was a
law enforcement agency within the meaning of section 4 and 11(1)(a) of the Act;



(3)       None of the NZSC, NZSFO or SMETL was an
authority or person in another country performing functions similar to that of
the NCA;



(4)       In obtaining evidence for the NZSC, NZSFO
or SMETL the NCA was not performing its functions within the meaning of
sections 17 or 19 of the Act.



(5)       The Information or some of it was
published in the media in New Zealand and Australia.”

14                 
Paragraph 99 alleges that the same loss and
damage particularised in para 62 has been suffered in consequence of the
breach of duty alleged in para 98.  

15                 
Paragraphs 101 to 105 contain the
allegation said to give rise to a cause of action against Crabb for misfeasance
in a public office.  It is first alleged
that, as a member of the IGC, Crabb was “required
by law not to disclose to any person other than a member of the IGC or a person
bound by section 51 of the Act the fact that the NCA was investigating the
affairs of the applicant or any information received by him [Crabb] in that capacity.”  It is then alleged that, before 20 February
1990, Crabb received information (“the Crabb information”) concerning the
business affairs of the applicant all or part of which he disclosed to the
Australian Broadcasting Commission (“ABC”) which published a story about the
applicant in the edition of the television program “The 7.30 Report” which went to air on 20 February 1990.  The disclosure of that information by Crabb
to the ABC is alleged in para 104 to have occurred:

“(a)     for one or more of the purposes set out in
paragraph 23 above;



(b)       with the sole or predominant purpose of
injuring the Applicant in his reputation, employment, public office or
business;



(c)        alternatively, with the knowledge that
the disclosure of the information was beyond power or otherwise illegal
involving a foreseeable risk of harm to the Applicant.”

16                 
It is next pleaded in para 105 that the
disclosure by Crabb inflicted actual economic loss on the applicant reflected
by loss of salary of $1.5 million per annum and a fall of at least $20,887,403
in the value of the applicant’s holding in Harlin.  The same loss and damage is alleged in
para 108 to have flowed from Crabb’s breach of a duty of care to the
applicant not to disclose the Crabb information.

17                 
Paragraphs 109 to 111 allege a conspiracy
by Seymour, Sherman (at one time Chairman of the NCA), the NCA and the DPP to
injure the applicant by unlawful means, “namely:

(a)       by the unlawful delegation by the NCA to
the DPP of its power to manage and co-ordinate the special investigation into
the business affairs of the Applicant.



....



(b)       The unlawful procurement of Seymour to be
appointed as a Victoria Police officer for the purpose of enabling the NCA to
charge the Applicant with criminal offences.



(c)        The unlawful assumption by the DPP of
the NCA’s powers to manage and co-ordinate the special investigation.



.....



(d)       The unlawful and deliberate disregard of
the requirements of section 12 of the Act.”

Particulars are appended to each of those sub-paragraphs
reciting matters from which it is said the agreement constituting each
conspiracy is to be inferred.  In
para 110 there is set out a series of overt acts alleged to have been
performed in furtherance of the conspiracy and para 111 alleges that the
applicant suffered, as a result of the conspiracy, loss and damage
particularised in the same way as the loss and damage alleged in para 62.

18                
Paragraphs 112 to 114 allege a further
conspiracy between the NCA, NZSC, NZSFO and SMETL “to injure by unlawful means the Applicant in his reputation, business
and public office.”  Particulars are
sub-joined to para 112 going to the agreements allegedly made between the
NCA and each of the New Zealand authorities and the unlawfulness of the means
agreed to be used.  In para 113
there is set out an extensive list of acts allegedly performed in furtherance
of the conspiracy between NCA, NZSC, NZSFO and SMETL and in para 114 it is
pleaded that, by reason of that second conspiracy, the applicant suffered loss
and damage particularised in the same way as that alleged in paras 88 and
89.  Paragraph 115 contains a claim
for exemplary damages against the NCA and Crabb “by reason of their contumelious disregard of his rights and reputation
when engaging in the conduct of each of them complained of above.”

Have the Forex Transactions been sufficiently
described?

19                 
A strong attack has been made by Counsel for the
NCA on the sufficiency of the allegations in paras 26 to 28 of the
substituted statement of claim which are reproduced at para 3 of these
reasons.  In the earlier reasons for
judgment of 19 July 1999, I referred to the claim that five different versions
of the Forex Transactions were “in the
public domain” and said, at para 71:

“Moreover, it is likely that, as a matter of appropriate case
management, Elliott will be required, shortly after the close of pleadings, to
file affidavits or witness statements embodying the evidence-in-chief which he
proposes to adduce at trial.  That will
necessitate his adoption of one explanation or another of the Forex
Transactions.  It is to be noted in this
context that para 27 of the statement of claim in its present form is
embarrassing because it requires the respondents to plead to the “purported
purpose” of the payments of $39.5M and $27M. 
If Elliott now accepts that those payments were not genuinely in
settlement of foreign exchange transactions, he should say so in the statement
of claim and, if relevant, he can indicate how and when he came to learn of the
real purpose for which those payments were made.”

20                 
It seems that para 28 has been included in
the substituted statement of claim in response to my intimation that “if Elliott now accepts that those payments
were not genuinely in settlement of foreign exchange transactions, he should
say so ......”.  However, the Forex
Transactions assume a particular significance in relation to allegations in
later paragraphs of the substituted statement of claim.  Thus, paras 48 to 52 under the heading “Scope of the Notices” assert that the
Bowen, Crabb, Duffy and other Notices did not and were not intended to include
the Forex Transactions and were not effective to initiate a valid investigation
by the NCA into the Forex Transactions. 
Those aspects of the Notices had the consequence, it is alleged in
paras 61 and 62, that the NCA, in breach of a duty of care owed to the
applicant, allowed the Second Sandon, the Duffy and the Sumner Notices to be
issued as a result of which the applicant suffered loss and damage.  

21                 
Paragraphs 80 and 81 of the substituted
statement of claim identify the investigation of the Forex Transactions as one
of the ulterior purposes for which summonses to the applicant were issued and
NCA hearings were conducted. 
Paragraph 85 imputes to “Leckie
and/or the NCA” an intention to interrogate the applicant in relation to
the Forex Transactions and knowledge that those transactions were not
genuine.  Those assertions, amongst
others, are then said in paras 86 and 87 to give rise to a cause of action
in negligence against either or both Leckie and the NCA.  Finally in this context, the investigation of
the Forex Transactions is identified as one of the unlawful means on which have
been erected the conspiracies alleged in paras 109, 112 and 113.  

22                 
Because the Forex Transactions are central to
several of the causes of action on which the substituted statement of claim has
been founded, I consider that they have been pleaded too elliptically in
paras 26, 27 and 28.  The Statement
of Claim should plead, not merely the making of the payments and how they were
recorded and described in the books of EXL, but the true nature of the
transactions pursuant to which they were made. 
It is insufficient, in my view, to assert, as is done in the particulars
to the present para 28 of the substituted statement of claim, that “the payments were made to discharge an
obligation of EXL owed to ETL.”  I
have set out in para 67 of the reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999 the
five accounts of the Forex Transactions which are said to have been “in the public domain.”  It should therefore impose no real burden on
the applicant to require him to give as full particulars as he can of the
circumstances giving rise to the obligation as far as those circumstances are
known to him.

23                 
If the nature of the Forex Transactions and the
circumstances surrounding them are fully set out in the manner just indicated,
it should be possible for the respondents to plead, without merely joining
issue, whether the various Notices and Summonses were apt to authorise
investigation into the Forex Transactions and, if so, what features of those
transactions are relied on as having that effect.  It is true that the respondents could file a
defence complying with O 11 rr 13 and 18 of the Rules of this Court
responding to paras 26, 27 and 28 of the substituted statement of claim as
they presently stand.  However, that
would oblige the respondents to set out their understanding of the Forex
Transactions, possibly in several alternative formulations.  I therefore consider that the applicant
should first be required to provide a comprehensive description of the Forex
Transactions by recasting paras 26, 27 and 28 of the substituted statement
of claim.

Allegations of Improper Purpose in Issuing Notices.

24                 
Counsel for the NCA focused another attack on
para 23 of the substituted statement of claim.  As Counsel for Elliott has pointed out, that
paragraph remains unchanged from earlier versions of the statement of claim.  It has been reproduced in para 2 of
these reasons.  Mrs Crennan QC, for the
NCA, submitted that the purpose of Messrs Bowen, Crabb and Sumner, who, apart
from Crabb, are not parties to the application, could not be relevant to any
cause of action pleaded against the actual respondents and para 23 should
be struck out as tending to embarrass or scandalise those non-parties.  However, as I understand the references to
the Notices in the substituted statement of claim, they are all seen as
contributing to establish the proposition that there was no valid Notice which
authorised the NCA’s investigation of the Forex Transactions.  The earlier Notices were superseded or “replaced” by the second Sandon, the
Duffy and the second Sumner Notices.  If
that understanding is correct, the references in para 23 to the allegedly
invalid purposes for which the earlier Notices were issued are apparently by
way of anticipating a defence that a “good root of title” as it were, can be
traced from those later Notices to the Bowen, Crabb and First Sumner
Notices.  Although, on that assumption,
para 23 could have been left to be pleaded in a reply, I am not at present
persuaded to strike it out.  

25                 
A related criticism has been directed at the
pleading in both paras 23 and 24 of the substituted statement of claim
that one of the purposes actuating the issue or the procurement of the Notices
to which those paragraphs are respectively related was:

“(a)     discrediting the
Applicant.”



26                 
As Mrs Crennan pointed out, there is an inherent
ambiguity in the use of “discrediting”to
identify an ulterior or unauthorised purpose. 
Action may be taken by a criminal investigation agency which is entirely
within its powers and for the purpose for which those powers have been
conferred, such as the successful prosecution of criminal charges against an
individual, and it will be a necessary incident of that action to “discredit”the individual.  However, as I understand the sense in which
“discrediting” is used in para 23, it is intended to convey that the
relevant Notices were issued without caring whether Elliott was an appropriate
“target”for a criminal
investigation, but simply to attract to him whatever opprobrium or “discredit”
might attach as a result of the investigation’s becoming known in the business
and political circles in which he moved.

27                 
The use of the expression“discrediting”in
para 44 may reflect its adoption by Mr Livermore of the NCA in a minute
referred to in sub-para (iv) of the particulars sub-joined to that
paragraph.  That minute referred to SMETL’s
allegation that the Forex Transactions were not genuine and said “that if it could be substantiated it will
possibly disclose offences in Australia in its own right and it would certainly
discredit the players involved ......”.  On its face, that would seem to be an
expression of opinion by Mr Livermore that, if Elliott or other “players” were
implicated in a sham transaction in New Zealand, that could be used to detract
from their credit if they were to give evidence as defendants to criminal
proceedings in Australia.  It would not
necessarily afford a basis for imputing to the NCA the same ulterior purpose
which I consider to have been attributed by para 23 to the instigators of
the Notices identified in that paragraph.

28                 
If my understanding of paras 23 and 44 of
the substituted statement of claim is correct, each of those paragraphs should
be amended to remove the ambiguity to which it seems to be subject.  

Lack or Insufficiency of Consultation with IGC

29                 
Paragraph 42 of the substituted statement of
claim alleges:

“Insofar as there was consultation with the IGC about the
reference of a matter by the Duffy Notice or approval by the IGC of the
reference of a matter pursuant to the Second Sandon and Second Sumner Notices,
such consultation was not had or approval not given in relation to a proposed
reference to be made by any of those notices.”



30                 
I agree with Mrs Crennan that, in its present
“rolled up” form, this paragraph is embarrassing and the respondent should not
be required to plead to it.  It is not
clear whether it is alleged that there was no consultation with the IGC about
the reference effected by the Duffy Notice, or that such consultation as there
was did not embrace, and did not result in the approval of, the reference
ultimately effected by the Duffy Notice. 
It seems to be accepted that there was some consultation with the IGC in
relation to the Second Sandon and Second Sumner Notices but that consultation
did not result in approval of the reference actually effected by those two
Notices.  The paragraph should be
disentangled and particulars provided of each consultation with the IGC which
is said to have occurred and the respects in which it failed to result in
approval of the reference purportedly made by the relevant notice or was
otherwise deficient.  

The Allegations of
Negligence against the NCA in relation to the issue of the Notices.

31                 
In the reasons for judgment published on 19 July
1999 it was noted at para 119:

“At no place that I can discover
in the present statement of claim is it alleged that any of the duties said to
have been owed by the NCA to Elliott was a duty of care.”



32                 
Various allegations of breaches of unspecified
duties said to have been owed to the applicant were then examined and it was
concluded at para 125:

“It should be clear from the necessarily brief discussion of the
authorities which I have undertaken in this part of these reasons that
Elliott’s ability to establish a cause of action in negligence against the NCA
will depend on proof of a complex set of circumstances going beyond persuading
the Court to adopt the construction of certain sections of the NCA Act for
which he contends.  I am not persuaded by
the facts so far revealed that his prospects of making the NCA liable in negligence
are so hopeless that all attempts to plead that cause of action should be
struck out of the statement of claim. 
However, the parts of the pleading where those attempts are made must be
clearly identified and drawn together. 
As well, all the circumstances (not merely identified statutory
provisions) relied on as establishing the requisite degree of proximity,
including those said to make it foreseeable that Elliott would suffer economic
loss in consequence of the NCA’s allegedly negligent acts or omissions, must be
fully pleaded or particularised.”



33                 
In submissions in support of the substituted
statement of claim, Counsel for the applicant claimed that he had “grasped the nettle with the duty allegation
and articulated the duty as a duty of care.”  The matters said to give rise to the first
duty of care owed by the NCA are set out as follows in para 58 of the
substituted statement of claim:

“When making the statements and representations referred to in
paragraph 39 above (the statements and
representations), the NCA:



(a)       knew or ought reasonably to have know
that Sandon, Duffy and Sumner would rely upon the statements and
representations to issue the Second Sandon, the Duffy and the Second Sumner
Notices respectively;



(b)       had already identified the Applicant as a
target of the NCA;



(c)        did so to enable the NCA to conduct the
special investigation into or concerning the business affairs of the Applicant;



(d)        knew or ought
reasonably to have known that:



(i)        the special investigation would be into,
among other things, the Forex Transactions;



(ii)       a summons or summonses would or might be
issued to the Applicant by reason of which the Applicant would incur legal
costs and expenses;



(iii)      the special investigation might lead to
the Applicant being charged with a criminal offence;



(iv)      the special investigation would or might
discredit the Applicant in his reputation, employment, his public office and
business and thereby cause him loss and damage;



(e)        knew that the Applicant would have no
knowledge of the circumstances in which Notices were procured.”



34                 
The statements and representations alleged in
para 39 are said to have been made by the NCA to Duffy and the IGC
culminating in the statement that:

“... Sandon, Duffy and Sumner were authorised to issue new
notices without first consulting with or obtaining the approval of the IGC as
was otherwise required by law.”



35                 
Particulars appended to para 39 indicate
that the statements and representations are to be inferred from three letters
and an agenda for minutes of a meeting of the IGC on 31 August 1990.  

36                 
The duty of care said to have arisen in the
manner indicated in para 58 is alleged in para 59 to have required
the NCA;

“(a)     to take reasonable care to ensure that
statements and representations made or information provided by the NCA for the
purpose of procuring a special investigation were accurate, true and were not
misleading.



(b)       to inform Duffy and the IGC, including
Sandon and Sumner, of all matters material to the performance of their
functions under sections 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Act.”



37                 
As a result of breaches of that duty which is
said to have occurred in making the statements and representations, it is
alleged in paragraph 62, the applicant has suffered loss and damage
particularised as follows:

“(1)     Had Duffy, Sumner and Sandon been informed
of the facts and matters set out in sub-paragraphs 60(a), (b) and (c) above and
the particulars under sub-paragraph 61(a) above, Sandon, Duffy and Sumner would
probably not have issued the Second Sandon, the Duffy and the Second Sumner
Notices.



(2)       As a consequence:



(a)       the NCA could not lawfully have conducted
the special investigation into or concerning the business affairs of the
Applicant including the issue of the Summonses, the holding or conducting of
hearings or the use of any evidence thereby obtained.



(b)       the Applicant would not have been
threatened by the NCA with criminal charges and subsequently charged and
prosecuted.



(c)        The threat of criminal charges and
subsequent charging and prosecution of the Applicant caused him the following loss
and damage:



(i)        legal costs and expenses incurred in
defending the charges $2,324,162.86.

(ii)       the loss of the opportunity to profit
from the Russian Textile joint venture project which opportunity is to be
valued to the Applicant’s account by reference to the following components:



a)         value of equity in joint venture $16.5
million;



b)         once only fee of $4.95 million;



c)         present value of 10% profit share in
projected joint venture profit;



d)         interest by way of damage.



(d)       Prior to 21 September 1993 the Applicant
was negotiating with the Australian Government and the owners of textile mills
in Russia for the establishment of a privately owned corporation, in which the
Applicant would have an equity, to own and operate the mills and associated
businesses and to supply them with Australian wool and obtain the necessary
financial accommodation.  The proposal is
substantially described in a draft business plan dated 23 September 1993.  Australian Government financial support for
the project was an essential element.  On
about 23 September 1993 the Australian Government became aware, through the
Minister for Trade, that the NCA was proposing to charge the Applicant with two
counts of theft and one count of taking money from one company and giving it to
another.  As a consequence of the
threatened charges, at some time on or after 23 September 1993 the Australian
Government withdrew its support for the project and the project wholly failed.  Further, the Applicant was unable to conclude
the negotiation and obtain his equity in the corporation and thereby lost the
value of that opportunity.”



38                 
I do not consider that any of the matters
pleaded in para 59, if established, would make out the relationship of
proximity between the Applicant and the NCA required as a matter of law to
impose a duty of care on the NCA.  In Grimwade v State of Victoria (1997) 90 A
Crim R 526, Harper J carefully traced the development by the High Court of the
concept of proximity as a constituent of a duty of care.  That review went from Jaensch v Coffey (1984) 155 CLR 549 through San Sebastian Pty Ltd v Minister Administering Environmental Planning
& Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (1986) 162 CLR 340, Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424 to Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609.  After noting some English authorities
revealing difficulties or limitations in the application of the concept, his
Honour observed at 549:

“One may acknowledge these conundrums while at the same time
firmly rejecting the conclusion that Sir Andrew Grimwade’s prosecutors are
liable to him in negligence.  In my
opinion, the courts have pointed the way either by reference to point (c) of
Deane J’s analysis of the first component of an action in negligence, or by
including policy considerations among the relevant factors when determining
whether the requirement of proximity is satisfied in a particular category of
case.



In this context, it is instructive to return to the components
which, in Jaensch v Coffey at 586 Deane
J identified as constituting an action in negligence in a case involving
physical injury in the form of personal illness.  It will be remembered that the first of these
components was “a relevant duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff to take
reasonable care resulting from the combination of (a) reasonable foreseeability
of a real risk that injury of the kind sustained by the plaintiff would be
sustained either by the plaintiff, as an identified individual, or by a member
of a class which included the plaintiff, (b) existence of the requisite element
of proximity in the relationship between the parties with respect to the
relevant act or omission and the injury sustained, and (c) absence of any
statutory provision or other common law rule ... which operates to preclude the
imputation of such duty of care to the plaintiff in the circumstances of the
case”.



If, in a case such as the present - which is not a case
involving physical injury - one were to add to point (c) an absence of any
reason in policy which might operate to preclude the imputation of a duty of
care to the plaintiff, then one would, it seems to me, have an adequate
description of the first of the components of an action in negligence
applicable to the present case.”



39                 
After a review of several English authorities
which concluded with Elguzouli-Daf v
Commissioner of Police of Metropolis [1995] QB 335, Harper J observed at
559:

“His Lordship’s reasoning is apposite in the present case.  In making the initial decision to
prosecute;  in deciding whether or not to
accept an application for a nolle prosequi; 
in deciding whether or not to directly present the plaintiff following
his discharge by a magistrate at the conclusion of the relevant committal
proceedings;  and in prosecuting at
committal and at trial - in each of these instances, the plaintiff’s
prosecutors were under a duty to be fair. 
In relation to the last of the instances, the question of the continued
usefulness of the torts of malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public
office would be very pertinent were a cause of action in negligence to exist as
against the prosecutors or the State.  In
relation to all of these instances I agree, with respect, that liability in
negligence would be even more inapposite than in the case of the opposing party
or his or her solicitor in civil litigation.



It follows that the State is not liable to Sir Andrew Grimwade
in negligence.  Either the relationship
between Sir Andrew and his prosecutors was not one of proximity because policy
considerations so decreed;  or the
relationship was one of proximity, but policy considerations intervened at the
next level of analysis to preclude the creation of a duty of care.  In either case, policy dictates that a
prosecutor not be bound by any duty to an accused other than a duty to be
fair.  To be more than fair to the
accused is to be less than dutiful to the Crown.”



40                 
Elguzouli-Daf
and Grimwade have been applied by
Higgins J in Emanuele v Hedley (1997)
137 FLR 339 in rejecting a claim that Australian Federal Police officers and
prosecutors were under a duty of care to the plaintiff to refrain from
prosecuting the plaintiff or to terminate the prosecution after it had been
commenced.  See also Hillman v Black (1996) 67 SASR 490.

41                 
Counsel for Elliott sought to equate the duty
allegedly owed by the NCA with that found by the High Court to exist in L Shaddock & Co Pty Ltd v Parramatta
City Council [No 1] (1981) 150 CLR 225 which is discussed in
para 116 of the reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999.  In that case, as Brennan J explained in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman, the
fact that the respondent Council was performing public functions was one of the
circumstances which warranted a conclusion that it realised, or should have
realised, that a person seeking information would act on that information so
that a duty of care arose in the giving of the information.  Mr Judd also referred to the recent judgment
of the High Court in Perre v Apand Pty
Ltd (1999) 164 ALR 606.  In that case
it was held that the respondent suppliers of seed potatoes to particular growers
in an area of South Australia owed a duty of care to growers in the same area
who foreseeably would be exposed to loss in the event of a prohibition on the
sale in Western Australia of potatoes from that area after an outbreak of
bacterial wilt in crops sown with defective seed supplied by the
respondent.  It will be remembered that
the statements and representations pleaded in para 60 of the substituted
statement of claim to have been made in breach of the duty of care owed to
Elliott were made to Duffy and the IGC. 
Unlike the statements which gave rise to the action in Shaddock v Parramatta City Council, they
are not said to have been acted on by Elliott himself.  Rather, it is put that a duty was owed to
Elliott not to mislead Duffy or the IGC into taking action with foreseeable
adverse consequences for Elliott.  That
distinction, I assume, explains the applicant’s recourse to Perre v Apand Pty Ltd where a duty of
care was held to arise because damage to the plaintiff was a foreseeable
consequence of the respondent’s breach of the primary duty owed to the
purchasers of the defective seed.

42                 
More significantly, no occasion arose in Shaddock or Perre v Apand Pty Ltd for the application of the concept of
proximity as affected by considerations of public policy like those identified
in, for example, Grimwade and Emanuele v Hedley.  Although inclined to differentiate, for
purposes of the law of negligence, between the inquiry mandated by the concept
of proximity and that into the application of policy considerations, Kirby J in
Perre v Apand Pty Ltd said, at 689
(footnotes omitted):

“Nor is this a case where to hold Apand to a legal duty of care
would be to interfere unreasonably with its economic freedom, its autonomy and
the competitive operation of the marketplace. 
As a matter of policy, the law will generally uphold the right of a
party lawfully to gain profit although doing so will occasion economic loss to
others.  That is often the very way in
which the market operates in our form of economy.  Apand certainly had an economic interest in
disposing of the non-certified seed when its original Saturna experiment was
called off.  But Apand was not entitled
to pursue that interest in a way that constituted a breach of the law.



Apart from any other reasons which may apply in this case, as
Hayne J has pointed out, the fruit and plant quarantine laws of South Australia
absolutely prohibited the importation or introduction into the State of South
Australia of any plant (defined broadly enough to include seed) affected by
bacterial wilt.  Yet upon the premises
established by the factual findings not now in dispute, this is precisely what
Apand did.  It is not necessary to
consider whether, absent such statutory prohibitions, illegality otherwise
affecting what Apand did in relation to the Perre Interests would have been
sufficient in any case to put a limit on 
Apand’s economic freedom so far as it impinged on the legitimate
interests, economic and otherwise, of the Perre interests.  No reason of policy arising from the ordinary
deference which the law pays to that economic freedom and market
competitiveness prevents a finding that a legal duty of care existed in this
case.



43                 
I have not been able to discern in the
substituted statement of claim any assertion that the NCA knew, or ought to
have known, that Elliott would rely on it to provide accurate information and
advice to the IGC or individual Ministers when requesting the issue of
notices.  Doubtless, Elliott, like any
other citizen, had an expectation that the NCA would exercise its statutory
powers responsibly and in good faith. 
But that does not entail the conclusion that the NCA was subject, in the
provision of information and advice to the IGC to a duty of care owed specifically
to Elliott.  If a duty of care of that
kind were imposed on the NCA in the circumstances of the present case, it would
seem to follow that a corresponding duty of care would be owed to Elliott by
the members of the IGC and each Minister who issued a Notice.  

44                 
For these reasons I have concluded that,
although the duty of care alleged in para 59 of the substituted statement
of claim is said to have arisen before any decision was taken to prosecute the
applicant, general policy considerations applicable to the investigation and
prosecution of criminal activity viewed as a continuous process operate to
preclude the ascription to the NCA of such a duty of care.

Allegations of Negligence against Leckie or the NCA
concerning the issue of Summonses.

45                
Paragraph 85 of the substituted statement of
claim imputes to Leckie or the NCA various intentions and states of actual or
constructive knowledge before the issue of the summonses requiring Elliott to
attend for examination before the NCA. 
Those matters are then alleged in para 86 to give rise to a “duty of care to the Applicant when issuing
the Summonses:

(a)        to ensure that the Summonses contained sufficient information
to enable the Applicant;

 

(i)         to know the general nature of the matters in relation to
which the NCA intended to interrogate him;

 

(ii)        to know the authorised scope of the special investigation;

 

(iii)       to know the fact that the NCA had already identified him as a
target;

 

(iv)       to know the intended us to be made of his evidence including
its provision to the NZSC, NZSFO and SMETL;

 

(v)        to exercise his rights under section 30 of the Act.

 

(b)        to ensure that each of the Summonses was accompanied by a
copy of the Bowen, the Crabb, the First Sumner and the First Sandon Notices.”

46                 
A breach of those alleged duties of care is then
asserted in para 87 as set out in para 9 of these reasons.  A causal link between those alleged breaches
of a duty of care is sought to be established by the Particulars to
para 88 which have been reproduced at para 10 of these reasons.

47                 
Several detailed criticisms have been made by
Counsel for the NCA suggesting that the applicant could not make out various of
the factual allegations made in these paragraphs.  Although many of those criticisms apparently
have considerable force, it is unnecessary for me to examine each of them in
detail because I consider that the applicant is precluded a fortiori from erecting a cause of action in negligence in
relation to the issue of the Summonses by the obstacles identified in
paras 38 to 42 above in the way of establishing the requisite relationship
of proximity between either or both Leckie and the NCA and Elliott as the
recipient of the Summonses.  Those
obstacles arise from public policy considerations which I say apply a fortiori to this second attempt to
make out a cause of action in negligence because the issue of the Summonses was
more centrally part of the investigation of criminal offences and the public
interest in the fearless discharge of that function has received statutory
recognition in s 36(1) of the Act which provides:

“A member has, in the performance of his functions or the
exercise of his powers as a member in relation to a hearing before the
Authority, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court.”



One of the functions or powers of a member of the NCA is
that conferred by s 28 of the Act to “summon a person to appear before the
Authority at a hearing to give evidence and to produce such documents or other
things (if any) as are referred to in the summons.”

Allegations of negligence of Leckie and the NCA in
conducting hearings.

48                 
This part of the substituted statement of claim
commences with para 90 which corresponds with para 85 discussed in
para 45 above.  The existence of duty of
care is pleaded in para 91 in these terms:

“As a consequence of the matters alleged in paragraph 90 above,
Leckie and/or the NCA owed a duty of care to the Applicant when conducting the
First Hearing to ensure that the Applicant was provided sufficient information
to enable him:



(a)       to know the general nature of the matters
in relation to which the NCA intended to interrogate him;



(b)       to know the authorised scope of the
special investigation;



(c)        to know the fact that the NCA had
already identified him as a target;



(d)       to know the intended use to be made of
his evidence including its provision to the NZSC, NZSFO and SMETL;



(e)        to exercise his rights under section 30
of the Act.”



49                 
Paragraph 92 alleges a breach of that duty of
care as appears from the text of that paragraph set out at para 11 of
these reasons.  There is much force in
the contention advanced by Counsel for the NCA that this part of the pleading
should have identified the “rights” under s 30 of the Act which Elliott
would have exercised but for the alleged breaches of a duty of care.  As has been demonstrated in Ganin v New South Wales Crime Commission
(1993) 32 NSWLR 423 at 435-436, the range of “lawful excuses” available under a
provision like s 30 is extensive. 
However, this third attempt to make out a cause of action in negligence
is focused on another part of the NCA’s investigative functions closely related
to the issue of summonses and is confronted by the same insuperable obstacles
identified in paras 44 and 47 above.

Alleged negligence of Leckie, Livermore and NCA in
disclosing Secret Information.

50                 
This fourth further or alternatives plea of a
cause of action in negligence is commenced by para 95 of substituted
statement of claim which alleges:

“Between December 1989 and July 1991 Leckie, Livermore and the
NCA exercised Coercive Powers to obtain documents, transcripts of evidence and
other information of and concerning the business affairs of the Applicant (the Information).”



51                
A state of actual or constructive knowledge
is then imputed by para 96 to Leckie, Livermore and the NCA as a result of
their having obtained “the Information”. 
That paragraph alleges that they “knew
or ought reasonably to have known:

(a)       that such of the Information as was
obtained from the Applicant was confidential to him;



(b)       that disclosure of any of the Information
to any other person would or might discredit the Applicant in his reputation,
employment, public office and business and thereby cause him loss and damage;



(c)        that any disclosure of the information
should:



(i)        be authorised by the Act or otherwise;



(ii)       be made only for the purposes of the Act;



(iii)      be made only in connection with the
performance of a duty under the Act.”



52                 
In consequence of the matters alleged in
paras 95 and 96, it is claimed in para 97, Leckie, Livermore and the
NCA owed various duties of care to the applicant which are described in the
terms set out in para 12 above. 
Breaches of one or more of those duties are particularised in
para 98 as reproduced in para 13 of these reasons.

53                 
This part of the substituted statement of claim
has attracted several valid criticisms as a matter of pleading.  For example, by defining it as widely as “the business affairs of the Applicant”
the pleader has allowed “the Information” to comprehend matters which by no
stretch of the imagination could be regarded as confidential.  Counsel for the NCA drew an apt parallel
between the difficulties created by the width of that definition and those
noted by Mason J in O’Brien v Komesaroff
(1982) 150 CLR 310 at 326, where his Honour said:

“..... the respondent has consistently failed to identify the
particular contents of the documents which he asserts constitute information
the confidentiality of which he is entitled to protect.  The consequence is that he has failed to
formulate a basis on which the court could grant him relief on the assumption
that some part or parts of the documents constitute confidential information.”



54                 
There are also difficulties in linking the
allegedly negligent disclosure of “the Information” to the damage alleged in
para 99 to have been suffered by the applicant which is said to be
particularised in the same terms as sub-para 2(c) of the particulars under
para 62.  However, it is unnecessary
for me to express a concluded view about whether these difficulties are curable
by a further amendment to the substituted statement of claim because I am
persuaded that the objections identified in paras 44, 47 and 49 above
which are common to the other formulations of negligence against Leckie or the
NCA are also fatal to the attempt to plead a cause of action arising from
disclosure of “the Information” in breach of a common law duty of care.  It is to be remembered in this context that
the applicant has abandoned or disavowed any attempt to allege breach of
statutory duty or misfeasance in a public office.

Allegations of Conspiracy between Seymour, Sherman, the
NCA and the DPP.

55                 
The first allegation of conspiracy against the
NCA is that contained in para 109 of the substituted statement of claim
that it, together with Seymour, Sherman and the DPP conspired to injure the
applicant by unlawful means.  Four
“unlawful means” are then identified in sub-paras (a), (b), (c) and (d)
reproduced in para 17 of these reasons. 
In the reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999, in commenting on an earlier
attempt to charge a conspiracy against the same parties, I observed at
para 89:

“I assume that the conspiracy between the NCA, Seymour, Sherman
and the DPP is also of that “unlawful means” kind.  If that is so, it remains necessary to plead
the agreement or combination and to establish that the occasion had arisen for
resorting to or threatening to resort to unlawful means.  Otherwise, there would be, as Dixon J pointed
out in McKernan v Fraser (1931) 46 CLR
343 at 361:



“… at
most … a combination for a purpose to be effected by a lawful means or, if
necessary, by unlawful means.  The
occasion did not arise for resorting to or threatening to resort to unlawful
means, and no circumstance occurred in which such means could have been
employed against the respondents.””



56                 
I entertain grave doubts whether the particulars
appended to para 109 of the substituted statement of claim, if
established, would give rise to the inference there asserted that there was an
agreement of the requisite kind between Seymour, Sherman, the NCA and the DPP.  Having regard to the extensive access to the
NCA’s records which the applicant has had by virtue of other related
litigation, including the criminal trial, I do not consider that those
particulars should be regarded as sufficient“until discovery” as is claimed in the particulars appended to
para 109(a) of the substituted statement of claim.

57                 
As I understand it, the substance of the
conspiracy sought to be alleged against Seymour, Sherman, the NCA and the DPP
is that, knowing that the NCA could not lawfully investigate Elliott’s business
affairs, the parties agreed that such an investigation should be conducted by
the DPP and that a prosecution arising out of it should be instituted nominally
by Seymour who was appointed a member of the Victoria Police Force for that
purpose and who was assisted by the DPP in framing and prosecuting the charges
against Elliott.  However, the
substantive allegations in sub-paras (a), (b), (c) and (d) of
para 109 do not sufficiently indicate what is said to make unlawful the
“means” there pleaded.  In addition the
“overt acts” pleaded in para 110
of the substituted statement of claim to have been committed in execution of
the conspiracy do not mirror the “unlawful means” alleged in
para 109.  Finally, it is not made
clear on the face of the pleading how any of those overt acts caused the damage
to the applicant which is identified in sub-para 2(c) of the particulars
set out at para 37 of these reasons.

Allegation that the NCA conspired with NZSC, NZSFO and
SMETL.

58                 
This allegation is contained in paras 112
to 114 of the substituted statement of claim. 
The conspiracy is said to have been constituted by four separate
agreements made between 9 May 1990 and 27 August 1990.  The NCA and one or more of the New Zealand
agencies is alleged to have been a party to each of those agreements.  Again, the applicant has set out to plead an “unlawful means” conspiracy but the
unlawful means agreed to have been adopted have not been related to each of the
alleged agreements.  Rather, it is said
in sub-para (f) of the particulars appended to para 112:

“The means by which the Applicant was to be caused injury were
unlawful because the NCA agreed to use its powers for purposes other than the
purposes for which they were conferred. 
The unlawful purposes were to:



(i)        investigate the
Forex Transactions;



(ii)       discredit the
Applicant;



(iii)      obtain evidence
for use of the NZSC;



(iv)      obtain evidence
for use of the NZSFO;



(v)       obtain evidence
for use by the SMETL.”



The facts and circumstances upon which the Applicant relies are
as alleged in paragraph 113 below.



Further particulars will be provided after discovery.”

59                 
That form of pleading raises the interesting
question of whether a conspiracy can be constituted by an agreement between two
or more conspirators under which only one corporate conspirator is to engage in
conduct which is ultra vires that
conspirator.  However, the fundamental
objection as a matter of pleading is that the “unlawful means” agreed upon has
not been identified, and no facts or circumstances have been pleaded which are
said to make those means unlawful.  In
this sense, para 112 suffers from the same vice identified in para 57
of these reasons.  

60                 
Paragraph 113 of the substituted statement of
claim alleges that:

“In furtherance of the conspiracy referred to in paragraph 112
above the following acts were performed.”



61                 
Then follow some thirty-two sub-paragraphs of
allegations of what I take to be “overt acts” committed in execution of the
“unlawful means” conspiracy alleged in para 112.  However, like the “overt acts” pleaded in
para 110 discussed at para 57 of these reasons, the actions alleged in
para 113 do not mirror the “unlawful means” allegedly agreed upon.  That probably reflects, in part, the failure
of para 112 to set out the “unlawful means” as distinct from the “unlawful
purposes” which were said to make ultra
vires the NCA’s agreement to use its powers.  However, the catalogue of what I have assumed
to be “overt acts” pleaded in para 113 contains many actions exclusively
attributable to one or other of the New Zealand agencies, or in at least one
instance, to another entity, the Australian National Companies and Securities
Commission, not alleged to have been a party to the conspiracy.  Presumably, the justification for pleading overt
acts of the kind just described is that they are alleged to have been performed
with knowledge that the NCA was seeking to achieve purposes which were beyond
its powers or unauthorised, but the pleading does not say so.  

The Claims Against Crabb

62                 
The claims previously formulated against Crabb
alleging misfeasance in a public office and four separate conspiracies are
discussed at paras 143 to 153 of the reasons for judgment of 19 July
1999.  The attempt to make out a cause of
action in conspiracy against that respondent has now been abandoned.  

(i)         Misfeasance in a Public Office.

 

63                 
This allegation has been retained in the
substituted statement of claim by pleading in para 101:

“At all relevant times Crabb, as a member of the IGC, was
required by law not to disclose to any person other than a member of the IGC or
a person bound by section 51 of the Act the fact that the NCA was investigating
the affairs of the Applicant or any information received by him in that
capacity.



PARTICULARS



The duty arises from the following
facts and matters:



(a)        the
provisions of the Act and the Victorian Act;



(b)       the fact that Crabb was a Minister of the
Crown for the State of Victoria.”



64                 
It is then pleaded in para 102 that Crabb,
in his capacity as a member of the IGC, received the Crabb Information “which he knew or ought reasonably to have
known would, if disclosed to the public, discredit the Applicant in his
reputation, employment, public office and business and thereby cause him loss
and damage.”

65                 
It is further alleged in the same paragraph that
Crabb disclosed the Crabb Information to the ABC in circumstances where he
knew, or ought to have known, that the ABC would disclose it to the
public.  There appears to be some force
in the submission made on behalf of Crabb that the particulars sub-joined to
para 102 are erroneous insofar as they assert that the provision of the
information to the ABC by Crabb has been admitted in Crabb’s affidavit sworn 15
May 1991 “in the Applicant’s defamation
proceeding against the ABC in the Supreme Court of Victoria.”  However, I do not consider that particulars
of the alleged disclosure to the ABC are necessary to enable Crabb to know the
case he has to meet in this respect, at least for the purpose of pleading in
his defence to para 102(b) of the substituted statement of claim.

66                 
The fact of publication by the ABC on 20
February 1990 is alleged in para 103 of the substituted statement of claim
and para 104 contains the allegations about Crabb’s purpose or state of
knowledge reproduced in para 15 of these reasons.  In paras 143 and 144 of the reasons for
judgment of 19 July 1999 it was observed:

“In para 108 of the statement of claim it is alleged that Crabb
owed a duty to Elliott not to disclose information about an investigation which
he, Crabb, received in his capacity as a member of the IGC.  As pointed out in para 121 above, a “duty of
secrecy” as it has been called may import a duty of care to the person who is
entitled to have the secret preserved, but I do not understand any breach of a
duty of care to be alleged against Crabb. 
Rather, it is alleged that he intentionally disclosed information which
he had received as a member of the IGC to the ABC for the purpose of
discrediting Elliott and achieving an electoral advantage for the Australian
Labor Party and an electoral disadvantage for the Liberal Party.  



Those allegations, in my view, would satisfy the requirements
for pleading misfeasance in a public office if they were accompanied by an
assertion, with appropriate particulars, that Crabb’s actions inflicted actual
economic loss on Elliott.”



67                 
I consider that paras 101 to 104 of the
substituted statement of claim sufficiently plead the actions and state of mind
necessary to constitute the tort of misfeasance in the public office discussed
in paras 101 to 102 of the reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999.  I also regard para 105 of the
substituted statement of claim as sufficiently alleging and particularising the
loss said to have been suffered by Elliott as a result of the disclosure to the
ABC of the Crabb Information.  Whether
all or any of the damage there particularised was in fact caused by the
publication by the ABC will doubtless be strongly contested.  As well, Mr Southall QC for Crabb has
foreshadowed a contention on behalf of that respondent that, as a member of the
IGC, he was not under a duty to keep secret information such as the Crabb
Information.  In the same context, Mr
Southall criticised the particulars to para 101 of the substituted
statement of claim as unduly laconic. 
However, I do not consider that Elliott should be required at this stage
to re-plead this part of his case.  After
delivery of a defence, it may be appropriate to set down for determination as a
separate or preliminary question pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Rules of
this Court, the issue of whether Crabb was required, in the exercise of his
office as a member of the IGC, not to disclose information like the Crabb
Information acquired by him in that capacity.

(ii)        Breach of Duty of Care.

68                 
Allegations framed to make out against Crabb a
cause of action in negligence have now been pleaded in paras 106 to 108 of
the substituted statement of claim. 
However, for the reasons explained in paras 38 to 42 above, I consider
that the conflict between Crabb’s public duty as a member of the IGC and the
duty alleged in paras 106 and 107 of the substituted statement of claim,
precludes, for reasons of public policy, the establishment of the relationship
of proximity necessary to found a cause of action in negligence.  Moreover, as Harper J pointed out in the
passage from Grimwade set out at para
39 above, the continued usefulness of the tort of misfeasance in a public
office, which the present applicant has invoked against Crabb, would be called
into question if a cause of action against him in negligence were to co-exist
on the same facts.  To similar effect,
Higgins J observed in Emanuele v Hedley
(supra) at 359:

“There is no tortious liability towards an accused person for
negligently investigating or prosecuting that person.  If there was such a cause of action, a
prosecutor would be liable for damages notwithstanding that there was no malice
and no lack of reasonable and probable cause for the investigation and
prosecution in question.  That would make
malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office and, indeed, intentional
infliction of harm by an unlawful act, otiose. 
It would also by-pass the torts of defamation and injurious falsehood.”



69                
No additional facts have been pleaded to
support a further or alternative claim in negligence against Crabb.  As Mr Judd frankly acknowledged, “the old paragraph 112(a) has re-emerged as
a negligence claim .....  Paragraph
112(b) of the old pleading has continued as misfeasance ......  The factual matrix underlying the causes of
action has not changed.  The real
substance of the changes of the case against Mr Crabb are changes to the bold
headings.  The substance of the
allegations has not materially changed.”

70                
For these reasons paras 106 to 108 of
the substituted statement of claim cannot be allowed to stand.

Conclusion

71                 
Counsel for each of the parties who remain
respondents to this application have been united in the force with which they
have drawn attention to the numerous attempts by the applicant over the
convoluted history of this litigation to refine successive versions of the
statement of claim to a point where each of the causes of action which he seeks
to maintain is unexceptionably disclosed. 
Those submissions have been directed to my adopting the course adverted
to by Gleeson CJ in Trau v University of
Sydney (1989) 34 IR 466 from which I quoted another passage at
para 154 of the reasons for judgment of 19 July 1999.  In a later passage, at 477, his Honour said:

“It is tempting to make an order which will bring a complete end
to this litigation.  The appellant’s
various claims against the university resemble the Hydra, and an undertaking of
the Second Labour of Hercules might well be a worthwhile exercise in the
interests of all concerned.”



72                 
A similar course is no less tempting in the
present case but, after much anxious consideration, I have decided on balance
that the applicant should be allowed one further opportunity to express in
proper form the reduced number of causes of action conceivably open to him.  I have been influenced to reach that
conclusion primarily by the reflection that the tortuous process to which
Counsel for the respondents have referred has resulted in a considerable
refinement of the applicant’s pleadings. 
In the light of earlier rulings or intimations, attempts to invoke an
action on the case in accordance with Beaudesert
Shire Council v Smith (1966) 120 CLR 145, the tort of intimidation, breach
of statutory duty, abuse of process and conspiracy against Crabb have been
abandoned or disclaimed.  As indicated in
paras 44, 47, 49, 54 and 70 above, each of the attempts to erect a cause
of action in negligence against any of the NCA, Leckie and Crabb have
failed.  

73                 
Accordingly, I have concluded, not without
diffidence, that the applicant should have one more opportunity to re-plead the
remaining two claims of conspiracy and the claim of misfeasance in a public
office against Crabb.  If that
opportunity is taken, it should be possible for Counsel, unembarrassed by the
need to retain much of the narrative relied on to support those causes of
action, including negligence, which are demonstrably unavailable to the
applicant, to identify in a coherent and self-contained way the material facts
said to give rise to each of the remaining causes of action.  I also expect that, when availing themselves
of the opportunity which I propose to afford, Counsel for the applicant will
also be instructed by the numerous cogent criticisms of a technical nature
which have been made of the attempts in the substituted statement of claim and
earlier versions of that pleading to disclose those causes of action.  These expectations engender the hope that the
final pleading will throw into sharper relief the questions of law affecting
those causes of action, which have been adumbrated in the course of the
examination to date of the statement of claim in its various emanations.  That, in turn, ought to permit a more concise
consideration of whether the applicant has a case which should go to trial.  

74                 
Accordingly, I shall order that the applicant
file and serve by 21 July 2000 a further draft amended statement of claim
confined to the causes of action in conspiracy and misfeasance in a public
office against Crabb which had been referred to earlier in these reasons.  I shall adjourn to a date to be fixed, being
not earlier than 7 August 2000 all motions on notice in these proceedings which
have not been finally disposed of.  The
question of costs of all parties of those motions and of the hearings on 27 and
28 September 1999 will be stood over to the date fixed for the adjourned
hearing of the extant motions.  To the
limited extent necessary, I shall make corresponding orders in the related
proceedings (VG 434 of 1993) in which Mr Scanlon is the applicant.


 
  
  I certify that the preceding seventy-four (74) numbered
  paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the
  Honourable Justice Ryan.

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: GJ, the appellant, seeks leave to appeal out of time pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed upon him by Sweeney DCJ on 15 March 2012. 

3The appellant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the following offences:

(i) Sequence 1: 

An offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which occurred between 16 September 2000 and 16 September 2002, with a victim who was under the age of sixteen years, namely aged seven or eight years. This offence carried a maximum penalty at the time of the commission of the offence of 20 years imprisonment. 

(ii) Sequence 9:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2006, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged twelve years. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to 
s 61M(1) is 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

(iii) Sequence 16:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2006 and 16 September 2007 when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged thirteen years. 

(iv) Sequence 7: 

An offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged fourteen years. 

(v) Sequence 11: 

An offence of using a child under fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2007, when the victim was twelve and thirteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. 



(vi) Sequence 8:

An offence of using a child above fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was fourteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

4All of the above offences were committed by the appellant on his youngest daughter. 

5When adhering to his pleas of guilty in the District Court, the appellant asked her Honour to take into account on sentence four offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act that had been placed on a Form 1. 

6The appellant was sentenced as follows (ROS 10):

(i) Sequence 9; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(ii) Sequence 16; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(iii) Sequence 11; a non-parole period of 2 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment.

(iv) Sequence 8; a non-parole period of 1 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2012, with an additional term of 1 year's imprisonment. 

(v) Sequence 7; a non-parole period of 3 year's imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2013, with an additional term of eighteen months imprisonment. 

(vi) Sequence 1 (taking into account the four offences on the Form 1); a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment, commencing on 20 January 2014, with an additional term of 3 years imprisonment. 

7The total effective sentence imposed by the Judge was 9 years imprisonment commencing on 20 January 2012 and expiring on 19 January 2021, with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 20 January 2012 and expiring on 19 January 2018. The earliest date the appellant is eligible to be released on parole is 19 January 2018. 

8The Judge had reduced the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 


FACTS 

9An agreed statement of facts was tendered which the Judge summarised in her sentencing remarks. The appellant was born in 1960 and married his wife in 1988, having three children. The youngest child was the victim of the appellant's offending. The offences took place between 2000, when she was 7 or 8 years old and the middle of 2008, when she was 14 years old. 

10Shortly stated the facts are: 

Sequence 1: This offence occurred when the victim was 7 or 8 years old. The appellant went into her bedroom (which she shared with her older sister). The victim was asleep but awoke when he pulled her legs to the side of the bed. He pulled down her underpants, knelt on the floor and held her legs in the air. He licked her vagina for about two minutes. 

Sequence 11: On three separate occasions in March, May and July 2006 when the victim was 12 years old, the appellant photographed her naked body and vagina with his mobile telephone. He told her how to position her body before he took the photographs. On two other occasions, in October 2006 and June 2007, when she was 13, he engaged in the same conduct. All of this conduct was dealt with as one charge. 

Sequence 9: On one of the occasions in sequence 11 in 2006, the appellant took the victim's hand and moved it along the shaft of his penis.

Sequence 16: On one of the occasions in sequence 11, in 2006 or 2007, when she was 13, the appellant touched her vagina with one of his hands.

Sequence 8: On two occasions in January 2008 and August 2008, when the victim was 14, he used his mobile phone camera to photograph her body and vagina. This conduct was dealt with as one count. 

Sequence 7: When the victim was 14 and having a shower, the appellant got into the shower with her, kissed her on the lips and put his tongue in her mouth (Form 1 offence - sequence 4). He told her to put her hand on his penis and guided her hand along the shaft for about 10 minutes (Form 1 offence sequence 5). He then positioned her against the wall and stood behind her, rubbing his penis against her vagina and bottom, moving backwards and forwards for three to four minutes (sequence 7). 

The other Form 1 offences involved the appellant rubbing his penis against the victim's vagina (sequence 14) and moving her hand along the shaft (sequence 17). 







The appellant's subjective circumstances

11At the time he committed the offences, the appellant was aged 40 - 48 years. He was 52 years old when sentenced. 

12The appellant had worked all of his adult life as a coach driver and had no prior convictions. 

13In a report dated 21 November 2011, Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, observed that the appellant did not have a psychiatric disorder, nor did he have any substance abuse issues. The Judge noted that Dr Nielssen reported that the appellant acknowledged his offences and expressed remorse for his behaviour. Her Honour stated (ROS 7):

""Although [the appellant] did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, I accept Dr Nielssen's professional opinion and accept [the appellant] is remorseful, as also indicated by his early pleas of guilty.""

14The Judge related Dr Nielssen's dismissal of paedophilia and characterisation of the appellant's offences as ""intra-familial, opportunistic offences that do not appear to be the result of a primary disorder of deviant sexual interest"". Her Honour noted Dr Nielssen's opinion: ""that this category of offence is typically associated with a lower risk of re-offending"" (ROS 9). Her Honour observed (ROS 9): 

""Dr Nielssen's opinion bodes well for [the appellant's] prospects of rehabilitation.""

The adjournment application 

15The application for leave to appeal was filed on 11 September 2014 some 2 years 6 months after the appellant was sentenced. An affidavit of Malcolm Douglas Carr, the appellant's solicitor, was filed in Court, which sought to explain the delay in instituting the appeal. As Mr Carr was not instructed prior to 4 December 2013, there was no material before the Court as to what may have occurred prior to that date after the appellant was sentenced. Mr R Sweet, the appellant's counsel recognised the difficulties that created for the appellant and sought an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. 

16The application for the adjournment was refused, as the Court considered that the proposed appeal had no merit and there were no prospects of success, even if the appellant was able to provide in the future a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay in commencing the appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the rejection of the appellant's application did not cause any injustice to him.

Grounds of Appeal 

17The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely: 

1. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to apply the totality principles, having added up the sentences for each of the offences. 

2. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to give any or any adequate reasons as to why she had ordered some of the sentences to be served cumulatively upon other sentences imposed.

18The two grounds of appeal may be conveniently dealt with together. 

19The appellant submitted that, having reached the conclusion after sentencing the offender on six separate offences, that the total effective sentence was 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years, her Honour erred ""in that she failed to record that she had considered and/or clearly failed to comply [with] the totality principle"" (AWS 2.1.1). The appellant referred to the totality principle having two limbs, the first being that the total effective sentence must ""bear a proper relationship"" to the ""overall criminality"" involved in all the offences and the second limb being that the ""total effective sentence imposed on an offender"" should not constitute a ""crushing sentence"" (AWS 2.1.3).

20A further contention was that, having reached the conclusion that it was appropriate for there to be ""partial accumulation"" of the sentences, her Honour fell into error in giving absolutely no reasons at all as to why it was that she imposed sentences that were ""partly concurrent and partly accumulated"", other than stating she had done so to ""achieve an appropriate total sentence"" (AWS 3.1.1).

21The Crown referred to the Judge's findings in her remarks on sentence and submitted that it was obvious that she had considered the principle of totality. The Crown pointed out that an accumulation simpliciter of the individual non-parole periods would have resulted in an effective non-parole period of 12 years. The Crown contended that the Judge clearly took into account totality in reaching an effective non-parole period of half that length, and only two-thirds of the effective head sentence, having appropriately found special circumstances in order to adjust the ratio of individual non-parole periods to head sentences (CWS 35).

Consideration 

22As the appellant was being sentenced for more than one offence, the Judge was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57. The total sentence imposed must properly reflect the totality of the criminality: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219. Subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation or concurrence are discretionary: Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; [2007] NSWCCA1; R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38; [2009] NSWCCA 115. 

23It is evident from her Honour's sentencing remarks that she carefully considered each of the offences and separately assessed their objective seriousness. After recounting the appellant's subjective case and determining that the sentences would be reduced by 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty, her Honour said (ROS 10): 

""To achieve an appropriate total sentence, the sentences will be partly concurrent and partially accumulated. I found special circumstances in the partial accumulation of the sentences to vary some of the non-parole periods"" (italics added) 


24In the exercise of her discretion, the Judge commenced the sentences for offence sequences 8, 9, 11 and 16 on 20 January 2012. The sentence for offence sequence 7, was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 11, as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2013. The sentence for offence sequence 1 (including Form 1 offences) was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 7 as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2014. 

25It is plain that the Judge undertook the task of separately determining the starting points and lengths of each of the sentences in order to give effect to the principle of totality. Her Honour was not obliged to otherwise explain the structure of the sentence. In my opinion, the total effective sentence was appropriate for all of the appellant's offending and was not a crushing sentence. Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal out of time be refused. 

26McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

Soon after it was boarded, an officer (under s 4 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) (‘the Act’)) gave notice of seizure of the Mitra, along with its nets, traps, other equipment and catch, under s 106C of the Act. That notice began a process which would result in the Mitra and its equipment and catch being the forfeited to the Commonwealth of Australia, if it had been used to commit certain offences under the Act. The two relevant offences are using a foreign boat for commercial fishing in the AFZ, or having a foreign boat equipped for fishing possession in the AFZ. However, it is a defence to each of these offences if the Mitra was in the AFZ as a result of a mistaken but reasonable belief of fact.  2                     The owners of the Mitra say that the ‘mistake of fact’ defence is available to them because the Master of the Mitra plotted his position using the Geographical Positioning System (‘GPS’) onboard the Mitra and he believed he was 11 nautical miles outside the AFZ. The owners say that in all the circumstances this was a reasonable mistake and they have therefore commenced these civil proceedings seeking a declaration that the Mitra is not forfeited and seeking to have the Mitra returned to them. 3                     The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (‘AFMA’) and the Commonwealth of Australia are the respondents in these proceedings. I will refer to them jointly in these reasons as AFMA.  AFMA says that the Master did not have a reasonable mistaken belief as claimed, relying upon a number of inconsistencies between his evidence (and that of his crew) and other evidence they have called.  In particular, they rely upon evidence which they claim shows that the Mitra was used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. Because of these matters, AFMA says that the Master should not be believed when he claims to have made a mistake as to his location.  Further, AFMA says that if the Master did make any such mistake, it was not a reasonable mistake in all the circumstances so that the owners cannot avail themselves of the defence.  4                     Before determining the central issues in these proceedings, it is necessary to determine certain threshold evidentiary issues raised by the parties in their written submissions.  The two evidentiary issues are who bears the onus of proof and what standard of proof applies to the central issues. The two central issues then to be determined are:  (a)    Was the Mitra being used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ? (b)   Did the Master have a mistaken but reasonable belief about his location? 5                     However, before turning to deal with these four issues, it is necessary to set out some of the factual background to explain how the Mitra came to be where it was at the time it was boarded. Further, while most of the facts relevant to these proceedings have been agreed between the parties and do not need to be set out here, it is necessary to set out certain of the agreed facts to clarify which elements of the offences under the Act are not in issue; and also to make it clear that the complicated processes at work under the Act are not in dispute. Finally, the relevant legislative provisions are set out below to make clear the various offences that may have applied to the Mitra in the circumstances and how the defence of a mistaken but reasonable belief may apply to those offences. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 6                     On 29 March 2008, the Mitra was fishing under licence in Indonesian waters quite some distance north of the AFZ.  The Master received a radio message from another fishing vessel in the area telling him that Indonesian Navy ships were conducting exercises in the vicinity and, because the Indonesian Navy had a reputation for “causing trouble” for foreign fishing vessels in Indonesian waters, the Master decided to leave that area to avoid contact with them.  As a result, the crew of the Mitra ceased fishing, pulled in the nets and set sail on a course south towards Australian waters. 7                     The Mitra sailed south for about seven hours, at the relatively high speed of about eight to ten knots.  As he came closer to Australian waters, the Master says that he saw a ‘red line’ on the GPS monitor which he assumed was the line in the GPS he had previously been told was the border of the AFZ. At about 11.30pm on 29 March 2008, the Master stopped the Mitra at a point which he thought, by reference to the GPS, was about 11 nautical miles north of the ‘red line’ and therefore 11 nautical miles north of the AFZ border.  At some point before the Master stopped the Mitra, the Chief Engineer of the Mitra, a Mr Xieu You Chai (‘the Chief Engineer’) told the Master that he had detected some problem with the main engine and wanted an opportunity to work on it.  After the Master stopped the Mitra, he told the Chief Engineer that he could start work on the engine.   8                     The owners say this work continued for about five hours and that the Mitra drifted on the tide during this period. AFMA says that this is the period when the Mitra was used for commercial fishing. If the owners are correct, then the Master’s actions are unimpeachable; but if AFMA is correct, then the Mitra was being used to commit an offence of the very kind that the enforcement provisions of the Act are intended to combat.  9                     At about 4.30am on 30 March 2008, while the engineers were working on the engine, the Master says he detected a boat approaching.  He says he initially thought it was an Indonesian Navy boat but that it turned out to be an Australian Navy Patrol Boat, ‘the HMAS Maryborough’.  At 5.12am a boarding party from the HMAS Maryborough boarded the Mitra.  It appears to be common ground that at the time of boarding, the engineers were working on the main engine of the Mitra and the engine was not operating. AFMA relies upon the observations of the boarding party to establish that the Mitra was used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. 10                  As noted above, the agreed facts make it clear that certain elements of the offences under the Act are not in issue and that the complicated processes at work under the Act are not in dispute. The pertinent agreed facts are as follows (a)       The applicants are the owners of the Mitra which is a foreign boat within the meaning s 106A of the Act. (b)       Tay Shan Jang was the master of the Mitra and theMitra was in his possession and under his control at all relevant times. (c)               The Mitra is (and was) a fishing trawler which is (and was) equipped with nets, traps or other equipment for fishing within the meaning of s 101 (1) of the Act. (d)              At the time it was boarded, the Mitra was at a place about 7 nautical miles inside the AFZ. (e)               None of the exceptions provided in ss 100(1)(a) and (b) and ss 101(1)(a) to (e) applied to the Mitra.  (f)                Chief Petty Officer Boatswain (‘CPOB’) Ray Manley, an officer under s 4 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) (‘the Act’), gave a notice of seizure of the Mitra along with its nets, traps, other equipment and catch (‘the seized things’) under s 106C of the Act. (g)               On 7 April 2008, the owners, through their solicitors, made a claim for the return of the Mitra and the seized things. That claim was treated by Australian Fisheries Management Authority (""AFMA"") as a claim made under s 106E of the Act. (h)                On 10 April 2008, AFMA gave a notice under s 106F of the Act, that the Mitra and the seized things would be condemned as forfeited under s 106G(2) of the Act unless the owners instituted recovery proceedings within two months. (h)       The owners commenced these proceedings on 14 April 2008.  In their application, the owners seek declarations and orders, among others, as follows:             1.          A declaration that the seized things are not forfeited pursuant to section 106G of the Act.              2.         An order that the seized things be delivered up and returned to the Applicants. THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS 11                  AFMA was established pursuant to s 5 of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 (Cth) (‘the Fisheries Administration Act’).  Its functions and objectives are set out in ss 7 and 6 respectively of that Act, along with s 3 of the Act.  In essence, these provisions require AFMA to implement efficient and cost-effective fisheries management on behalf of the Commonwealth and to ensure that the exploitation of its fisheries resources is conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development as defined in s 6A of the Fisheries Administration Act.  This kind of legislation has been described as being “of great importance economically and politically to the preservation of Australian fishing interests” see Chiou Yaou Fa v Morris (1987) 87 FLR 36 (‘Morris’). 12                  The term ‘AFZ’ is defined in s 4 of the Act to mean the Australian fishing zone which is, in turn, defined in that section as follows: ‘(a)      the waters adjacent to Australia within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of Australia; and (b)             the waters adjacent to each external territory within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of the external Territory;            but does not include: (c)             coastal water of, or water tithing the limits of, a State or internal Territory; or (d)             waters that are excepted waters.’ ‘Exclusive economic zone’ is defined in s 4 of the Act to mean “the exclusive economic zone, within the meaning of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 (Cth)”.   That definition, in turn, adopts the meaning in Articles 55 and 57 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provide as follows: The exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in this Part, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention. The exclusive economic zone shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. 13                  Part 6 of the Act (ss 83-108B) deals with surveillance and enforcement.  The relevant enforcement provisions for foreign boats such as the Mitra are set out in Division 5 of Part 6 (ss 99-105) of the Act.  The purpose of these types of enforcement provisions is “to protect Australian fishing grounds from exploitation by the use of foreign boats without the permission of an Australian official: see Cheatley v The Queen (1972) 127 CLR 291 at 295-296 per Barwick CJ.  Leaving aside the question of the mistake of fact defence, the parties agree that the Mitra was involved in offences against ss 100 and 101 of the Act. The relevant parts of those sections are as follows: 100  Using foreign boat for fishing in AFZ—strict liability offence (1)       A person must not, at a place in the AFZ, use a foreign boat for commercial fishing unless: [it is agreed that these exceptions do not apply – see above] … (2)       A person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units. (2A)     Strict liability applies to subsection (2).  [emphasis added] 101  Having foreign boat equipped for fishing—strict liability offence (1)       A person must not, at a place in the AFZ, have in his or her possession or in his or her charge a foreign boat equipped for fishing unless: [again, it is agreed that these exceptions do not apply – see above] …  (2)       A person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units. (2A)     Strict liability applies to subsection (2). [emphasis added] 14                  As is apparent from ss 100(2A) and 101(2A) (above), offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2) of the Act are defined as strict liability offences.  S 3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) gives effect to the Criminal Code (the ‘Criminal Code’) as a law of the Commonwealth and, under s 2.2(2) of the Criminal Code, that Code applies to the offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2) of the Act.  S 6.1 of the Criminal Code relevantly provides as follows: 6.1  Strict liability   (1)       If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of strict liability:             (a)        there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and             (b)        the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is available. …  (3)       The existence of strict liability does not make any other defence unavailable.  [emphasis added] 15                  S 9.2 of the Criminal Code relevantly provides as follows: 9.2  Mistake of fact (strict liability)   (1)       A person is not criminally responsible for an offence that has a physical element for which there is no fault element if:             (a)        at or before the time of the conduct constituting the physical element, the person considered whether or not facts existed, and is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and             (b)        had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted an offence.  [emphasis added] 16                  It is clear from these provisions that a mistake of fact as defined in s 9.2 can be relied upon to avoid criminal responsibility for a strict liability offence. Further, s 6.1 makes it clear that where an offence is described as an offence of strict liability (as here), the offence does not involve any fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence.  Given the size of the AFZ and the significant resources required to police it, it is not difficult to see why the legislature has decided to expressly exclude the need to prove a fault element in the prosecution of the offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2).  S 4.1 of the Criminal Code describes the ‘physical elements’, as follows: A physical element of an offence may be: (a)                conduct; or (b)               a result of conduct; or (c)                a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs. 17                  Because of these clear provisions of the Criminal Code (and others – see [20] below), it is not necessary to delve into the sorts of questions that have arisen in numerous authorities over the years, as to whether fault is an element of the relevant offences under the Act, whether mistake of fact is a defence to those offences and who will bear the onus of proof on these issues: see, for example, Morris  at 52 to 61 (dealing with a prosecution under a predecessor to the Act), and He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 (‘He Kaw Teh’) (dealing with a prosecution under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) prior to the introduction of the Criminal Code). The meaning of ‘reasonable belief’ as used in s 9.2 of the Criminal Code will be considered later in these reasons. WHO BEARS THE ONUS OF PROOF AND WHAT STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIES? 18                  The two threshold evidentiary issues I need to consider before considering the two central issues are: who bears the onus of proof and what standard of proof applies to the two central issues? 19                  On these evidentiary issues, AFMA submitted that:  a)        The owners have an evidentiary onus to raise the defence of      mistake of fact under section 9.2 of the Criminal Code; b)      The owners discharged that onus by adducing evidence from the Master to the effect that he was operating under a mistake of fact at the time; c)       AFMA therefore bears the onus of negativing that defence; and d)      AFMA is required to discharge that onus on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. 20                  In my view, AFMA has correctly identified who bears the onus of proof and, with one qualification, it has correctly identified the standard of proof that applies in determining the two central issues.  Neither counsel referred me to s 13 of the Criminal Code which deals with the onus of proof in the prosecution of offences under the Criminal Code. Since AFMA has conceded that the owners have discharged their evidential onus (see 19(b) above), it follows from s 13 that AFMA bears the onus of disproving or negativing the defence of mistake of fact: see ss 13.3(2) and 13.1(2) respectively of the Criminal Code. 21                  As to the question of the applicable standard of proof, AFMA relied upon the decision of French J. in Olbers v Commonwealth of Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 229; 136 FCR 67 (‘Olbers’).  In Olbers, French J had to consider the same sections of the Act as have arisen for consideration in this case.  In determining what approach he should take to the question of whether or not offences had been committed under ss 100 and 101 of the Act, his Honour observed (at [65]) that: “although these are civil proceedings a finding that offences had been committed is a serious matter and it is necessary that an appropriate degree of satisfaction be reached, albeit it is not necessary that I be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that offences have been committed”. 22                  His Honour’s observations are based upon Dixon J’s often quoted observations in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 and the long line of High Court authorities since then, including Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 67 ALJR 170.  In that case, in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Brennan, Deane, and Gaudron JJ their Honours observed that while “the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove”, such statements “should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof” (at 170 – 171). Their Honours had earlier emphasised that the standard of proof in civil proceedings is the ‘balance of probabilities’, even where the matter sought to be proved involves criminal conduct.  23                  Based on these authorities and given the concession made by AFMA, I will therefore proceed on the basis that AFMA bears the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that: (a)    the Mitra was being used by a person or persons for commercial fishing in the AFZ in contravention of s 100(2); and (b)   the Mitra was not within the AFZ at the time as a result of a mistake of fact on the part of the Master under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code.  While the civil standard applies to the proof of these two issues, since they involve serious matters, namely contraventions of the Act, clear or cogent evidence is required to prove the alleged conduct. WAS THE MITRA BEING USED FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING AT THE TIME? Introduction 24                  The first central issue for determination is whether AFMA has established that the Mitra was being used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. On this issue AFMA has relied upon observations made by Royal Australian Navy personnel shortly after they boarded the Mitra, in submitting that the inference should be drawn that the Mitra had been used for commercial fishing “some 3 – 4 hours” before it was boarded. These observations concerned the condition of the equipment on the Mitra, the presence of fish on the deck of the Mitra and the condition of some fish in the freezer of the Mitra. AFMA has also relied upon a number of inconsistencies which it says exist in the evidence of the Master, the Chief Engineer and the crew of the Mitra on this and other issues. 25                  While much of the evidence at hearing was directed to this issue, I do not consider it necessary to do more than set out a summary of the main parts.  This is because there is other independent, objective evidence which I consider establishes that it is unlikely that the Mitra could have been used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. I will briefly refer to, and make some observations on, the evidence of the owners and of AFMA before turning to consider that independent and objective evidence. The crew and the Master deny the Mitra was used for commercial fishing 26                  There is no direct evidence that the Mitra was being used for commercial fishing while it was within the AFZ. In their interviews with AFMA personnel, conducted some days after they arrived in Darwin Harbour on 2 April 2008, and while they were in detention, the crew members of the Mitra variously stated: that the fishing nets had last been hauled onto the boat about 10 hours before the boat was boarded (according to Mr Song Shi Young); that the last episode of fishing had occurred on the afternoon of 29 March 2008 (according to Mr Xiao Hai Zheng), or that the last fishing occurred on the morning of 29 March 2008 when it was “nearly noon” (according to Mr Zheng Shi Xeng).   27                  There are some obvious inconsistencies in these various versions.  However, they are all consistent in claiming that the Mitra was last used for fishing before it began its run south. Moreover, they are all consistent in claiming that no fishing occurred in the 3 to 4 hour period before the Mitra was boarded, as is asserted by AFMA. 28                  The Master said in evidence that he was certain that there had been no fishing in Australian waters at any time and that there had been no fishing for at least 24 hours before entering Australian waters. On its face, this evidence is inconsistent with the statements of the crew members who put this intervening period at between 10 and 18 hours. However, it is broadly consistent with the statements that the Master made in his interview with CPOB Manley soon after the Mitra was boarded and it becomes more consistent with the statements of the crew members when the explanations he gave in cross-examination are taken into account. The interview with CPOB Manley was conducted through an interpreter, using numbered interpreter cards. The relevant details appear in CPOB Manley’s affidavit as follows: I then proceeded to ask the Master a number of further questions using the Indonesian and Taiwanese cards.  Among the questions asked, and the Master’s answers were: In response to being shown Indonesian card 21 and Taiwanese card 16 which both ask “How many days have you been in the area?”, the Master responded one day. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 18 which asks “How many days have you fished here?”, the Master indicated that he had not been fishing in this area. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 24 which asks “How long has your fishing equipment been in the water?”, the Master responded not in this area.   In response to being shown Taiwanese card 27 which asks “Have you caught any fish in the area?”, the Master answered that he had not caught any fish in this area. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 31 which states “You are currently in Australian water”, the Master disputed his position and claimed that the position on the vessel’s GPS indicated that he was in Indonesian waters and not in the Australian area.   In response to being shown Taiwanese card 33 which states “It is illegal to fish here without a license”, the Master replied that he was not fishing here, but in Indonesian waters. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 34 which asks “Why are you in this area?”, the Master responded that the engine was broken. In response to being shown Indonesian card 32 which asks “Which country’s waters are you currently in?”, the Master responded that he was in Indonesian waters, and pointed at the vessel’s GPS indicating from the vessel’s position up as Indonesian waters. … After the Master stated during the questioning that Mitra 2139’s engine had broken, I asked him [h]ow long to repair the engine and he replied one day.  I then repeated the question and asked “one day to repair engine?”, to which the Master nodded his head and replied “yes”. [emphasis added]   29                  In his cross-examination by Mr Macliver (Counsel for AFMA), the Master explained what he meant by his statements (above) that he had been in the area “one day” and the engine was under repair “one day” as set out in the following excerpt of transcript: QUESTION: Mr Macliver: Could the witness be shown Mr Manley’s affidavit?  Mr Jang, can you look at the card marked number 34.  It’s page 24 to Mr Manley’s affidavit, annexure RCM3.  That asks does your engine work. ANSWER: The interpreter: I told them we still repairing. QUESTION: Mr Macliver: Yes, you told them the engine was broken? ANSWER: The interpreter: Yes, he told them they were still repairing. QUESTION: Mr Macliver: And did you also say that the engine had broken down and had been repaired for about a day? ANSWER: The interpreter: Yes. I tell them that we – the engine is broken and we have been repaired a day.  A Chinese day is not been 24 hours.  Chinese day is today.  Chinese means – “one day” it means “today”. MR MACLIVER: Thank you, Mr Jang. THE INTERPRETER: Yes, “a day” means “today”. 30                  Given that he had stopped at about midnight on 29 March 2008 and the Chief Engineer commenced work on the engine shortly thereafter, the Master’s explanation that the engine had broken down and was being repaired “today” and not “one day” is plausible.  AFMA submitted that this explanation should not be accepted, but did not call any evidence to challenge the claim the Master made (that ‘one day’ means ‘today’ in Chinese). I therefore reject AFMA’s submission. 31                  This exchange between the Master and Mr Macliver exhibits communications problems similar to others that arose during the hearing of this matter. It seems likely that such problems would have been present throughout the process, dating back to the time the Mitra was boarded. In my view these problems stem from language difficulties and cultural differences.  Another example of the language difficulties arose in relation to the expression “broken down” and whether it meant “having problems with the engine” (burning a lot of oil for example), or whether it meant the engine was not operating at all.  Another example of the cultural differences arose over the length of the Master’s experience as the Master of the Mitra.  He claimed he was appointed in 2004.  He was challenged in cross-examination with a document obtained from the Taiwanese authorities that seemed to suggest that he was appointed in 1991.  His explanation in cross-examination was to the effect that 2004 in the Western calendar was the equivalent of 1991 in the Taiwanese calendar.  While AFMA maintained this attack on the Master’s veracity during its initial closing submissions, it conceded in a subsequent set of submissions, by agreement with the owners, that the Master was correct. 32                  The owners filed an affidavit by Ms Yu-Yen Chen. Ms Chen described in some detail the communications problems she witnessed the Master and the crew experiencing from, what she claimed was, incorrect interpretation. She said she thought these problems were further compounded by the technical language used in relation to commercial fishing. She also noted that the Master had a strong Taiwanese accent while other members of the crew were from two different provinces of China and had strong accents from the dialects they spoke.She gave various examples of what she said were “wrong translations” of words such as ""charts"" (she claimed that word would only be understood as ""sea map"" in Mandarin), ""border"", ""EEZ"", ""bridge"", ""reluctant"", ""route"" and “symbol”.   33                  While I am dealing with the question of the Master’s credit, I should mention that AFMA also challenged the Chief Engineer’s credit, in particular, in relation to his evidence about having worked on the engine of the Mitra for about five hours after it stopped.  To do so, AFMA called Mr Ronald Halstead, a Marine Surveyor, to give some opinion evidence as to how long it would take to do the work that the Chief Engineer claimed he performed on the engine.  Mr Halstead’s evidence was to the effect that it would take approximately 15 hours to replace the piston rings on the two cylinders of the Mitra’s engine.  I reject this evidence.  In my view, Mr Halstead did not have sufficient direct experience or knowledge of the relevant circumstances to allow him to express this opinion.  He said in cross-examination that he last did any ‘hands-on’ work as an engineer on the engine of a boat in 1969 and most of his experience in the past 30 to 40 years has been in an administrative or managerial capacity.  Further, he agreed in cross-examination that he has never replaced the piston rings on an engine of the same kind as the Mitra’s engine and he also agreed that he had no knowledge of the Chief Engineer’s skills as an engineer, or his speed of work. Having rejected this evidence, I see no reason not to accept the Chief Engineer’s evidence that he worked on the Mitra’s engine for about five hours after it stopped. 34                  Having seen the Master and the Chief Engineer cross-examined in the witness box, and taking into account the various communications problems noted above, my impression was that most, if not all, of the apparent inconsistencies in their evidence arose from language difficulties and cultural differences. I consider that they were both doing their best when giving their evidence to accurately describe what had happened, whilst displaying some natural frustration about the communication problems that had beset them. The observations of the boarding party 35                  The boarding party consisted of six Royal Australian Navy personnel.  CPOB Manley was the officer in charge.  He was assisted by Messrs Bennett, Hughes, Peach, Schonewille and Wraight.   36                  On the issue of the condition of the equipment and fish on the deck of the Mitra, various of the members of the boarding party said that they had observed that: the net on the rear deck of the Mitra was wet; there were fish caught in the net and fish on the deck around the net that were “wet”, “soft” and “pliable”; there was mud on the net that was “soft” and “pliable”; and there was a small stingray on the deck that had traces of blood on its body which had not yet congealed and which was sticky when touched.  AFMA tendered a number of photographs of the fish on the deck and of the fish in the Mitra’s freezer. 37                  In opposition to this evidence, there was evidence, particularly from the Master, that the net was wet because there was a deck hose in the area where the net was located and that hose was frequently used by the crew for ablutions.  Further, in cross-examination of various of the members of the boarding party, Ms Kelly (Counsel for the owners) established that they each had very different ideas as to what the word “pliable” meant, ranging from: “the fish not drying out and therefore becoming firm and hard” (in the words of CPOB Manley), “when a finger is pressed into the flesh it leaves a sort of depression in the flesh” (in the words of Mr Schonewille), and “not entirely fresh, still sort of fresh in a way” (in the words of Mr Hughes).  Mr Schonewille also said that the fish on the deck appeared to be “by-products” of a catch and that some of the fish had been caught up against the fish trays on the edge of the deck. 38                  The evidence as to the condition of the fish in the freezer of the Mitra came from Mr Hughes and Mr Schonewille.  They said that there were about six trays of fish in the freezer that appeared to be ‘fresh’, ‘wet’ and ‘pliable’; and which had a ‘shine on the skin’, with ‘no frost’.  They said the heads of these fish had been cut off and that at the cut sites there was blood and raw flesh present.  In addition, AFMA called Mr Peter Davies, an AFMA officer with extensive experience in the fishing industry including 10 years of experience owning and operating a prawn trawler.  Mr Davies gave opinion evidence to the effect that he estimated that any fish placed in the freezer of the Mitra would be completely frozen within six to eight hours and that the smaller fish observed in the freezer would freeze in a period of “possibly less than two hours”. He also said that because the fish were not in sealed plastic bags he would expect them to attain a coating of frost and that no such coating was shown on these fish. 39                  In response to this evidence, the Master said that he only had one of the two freezer motors turned on at the time because the freezer was not full. The Master said that in his experience, with only one freezer motor turned on, it would take fifteen to twenty hours to start to see frost forming on these fish.  No clear and cogent evidence the Mitra used for commercial fishing  40                  In my view, leaving aside the independent and objective evidence that I refer to below, none of this evidence is of a kind that persuades me on the balance of probabilities that the Mitra had been used for commercial fishing in the three to four hours prior to it being boarded.  There are numerous reasons why a net on a fishing trawler might be wet, apart from use in commercial fishing (from sea spray, rain, or as suggested in this case by the Master, spray from the deck hose).  Moreover, no evidence was called to establish how quickly the net may have dried out, particularly at night time.  41                  As for the fish that were observed on the deck of the Mitra, in my view, the most that could be concluded from their “sort of fresh” condition is that the Mitra had been used for fishing at some time in the recent past, which was not denied by the crew members (who said it had been 10 to 18 hours before the boarding).  AFMA did not call any evidence to establish any clear and cogent correlation between the condition of those fish and the period of time that they had been out of the sea. Finally, I consider the condition of the fish in the freezer of the Mitra falls into the same category.  The evidence does not provide any clear and cogent correlation between the condition of the fish in the freezer and the relatively short period of time during which AFMA says the Mitra was used for commercial fishing.   42                  AFMA made a number of other submissions going to inconsistencies in the evidence of the Master, the Chief Engineer and the crew.  However, I do not consider it necessary to detail these submissions in light of the independent, objective evidence that I will turn to now. That evidence shows that in the five or six hours before it was boarded, the Mitra was not moving at a sufficient speed to engage in commercial fishing. The VMS data – independent and objective evidence of the movements of the Mitra 43                  After these proceedings were issued, the owners obtained the Mitra’s vessel monitoring system (‘VMS’) data from the Taiwanese authorities and they tendered it in evidence.  The VMS is a system used by various authorities around the world, including Australian authorities, to record the geographic co-ordinate positions of vessels, using satellites and computers.  Among other things, the VMS data includes the longitude, latitude, date and Greenwich Mean Time (‘GMT’) of each vessel within the system. 44                  The VMS data does not show the actual location of the vessel on a map, nor the speed at which the vessel is travelling – rather it shows its geographic coordinates from time to time.  Nonetheless, it is possible, using the VMS data to plot the course of a vessel on a map and to calculate the average speed of the vessel’s movement from point to point on that map.  For the purpose of these proceedings, both parties employed experts to carry out these exercises and calculations.  Mr Wayne Bateman was employed by the owners and Mr Robert Stroud was employed by AFMA.  After these two experts had prepared their reports, I directed them under O 34A of the Federal Court Rules 1979 to consult with a view to coming to an agreement on any issues upon which they disagreed.  As a result the parties filed a “Statement of Issues agreed by Expert Witnesses” (‘The Agreed Experts’ Statement’) as signed by Mr Stroud.  There were four areas of disagreement addressed in the Agreed Experts’ Statement, all relating to the movements of the Mitra on 29 and 30 March 2008.  On each of those areas of disagreement, the agreed position the two experts came to was that Mr Stroud’s calculations were more accurate. 45                  In his affidavit sworn on 19 May 2008, Mr Stroud detailed the movements of the Mitra on 29 and 30 March 2008. They can be summarised as follows: a.       From 1630 local time on 29 March 2008 to 2330 local time on 29 March 2008 (7 hours), almost due south at between 8.3 and 9.5 knots. b.      From 2330 hours local time on 29 March 2008 to 0007 hours local time on 30 March 2008 (37 minutes), in a south-south-easterly direction at 1.8 knots; c.       From 0007 hours local time to 0430 hours local time on 30 March 2008 (4 hours 23 minutes), due east and then slightly south of due east at between 0.1 and 0.9 knots; and d.      From 0430 hours local time to 0512 hours local time on 30 March 2008 (42 minutes), due west at between 0.2 and 0.4 knots. 46                  In addition to the movements (above), in the Agreed Experts’ Statement, Mr Bateman and Mr Stroud agreed that the Mitra crossed into the AFZ at 13:11:50 hours (GMT) (2241 hours local time).  This occurred about 48 minutes before the end of the Mitra’s course due south.  I find Mr Stroud’s evidence (above) to constitute an accurate summary of the Mitra’s movements at these various times. 47                  In their final submissions, AFMA conceded that the Mitra could not have been used for fishing while it was travelling south at average speeds in excess of 8 knots (between 1630 hours and 2330 hours local time on 29 March 2008), for the reason described below.  Since the Mitra passed into the AFZ at 2241 hours local time, it follows that the only period during which the Mitra could have been used for commercial fishing in the AFZ was between 2330 hours local time on 29 March 2008 (when it ceased its voyage south) and 0512 hours local time on 30 March 2008 (when it was boarded).   The requisite speeds to successfully trawl for fish 48                  Like all fishing trawlers, the Mitra has a maximum and minimum range of speeds necessary to successfully trawl for fish.  The evidence on this point came from the Master and from Mr Davies.  The Master’s evidence was that the Mitra generally needs to travel at a speed of 3 to 4 knots to successfully trawl for fish.  The Master said that if the Mitra travelled at less than 3 knots, the nets would not be suspended at the correct angle behind the Mitra and no fish would be caught.  On the other hand, he said that if the Mitra travelled at more than 4 knots, the nets would come too close to the surface and no fish would be caught.  When asked about this issue in cross-examination, the Master steadfastly maintained that the Mitra had to be travelling at 3 to 4 knots to catch fish and he rejected the suggestion that it could travel at a slower speed, saying (through an interpreter): “not 1 or 2, otherwise the net won’t open.  Have to be 3 to 4”.  Mr Macliver asked the Master whether the Mitra’s “fishing speed of between 3 to 4 nautical miles per hour [could] be a combination of the vessel’s own speed plus the speed of any water current that it is travelling through?”  He responded: “Yes.  The GPS can show if the, like, current waters, for example, reduce the speed, yes”.   49                  I interpolate that the only evidence about the tide movements at, or shortly before, the Mitra was boarded came from Mr Jeffrey Davison, a Royal Australian Navy officer, who said in his affidavit that the “prevailing set (current) and rate of drift in the area was 220 [degrees] at 1 knot (1nm per hour).  The wind and swell at the time of boarding of  Mitra 2139 was negligible in that there was only light and variable Easterly winds up to about 5 knots with a maximum Southerly swell of up to 0.5 metre – in other words flat calm seas and beautiful weather.  These conditions as to wind and swell but not current had been experienced for the previous 12 hours”.  50                  Mr Davies’ evidence about the Mitra’s requisite range of speeds for fishing was given in cross-examination by Ms Kelly.  That evidence was transcribed as follows: QUESTION - Ms Kelly: And can you tell us, Mr Davies, when a commercial fishing vessel has its nets out the back and is trawling for its catch, what speed does the boat generally go? ANSWER – Mr Davies: Usually around three knots, depending on the power of the vessel, which is, for us, a brisk walking speed, but around three knots. QUESTION – Ms Kelly: A little bit more sometimes? ANSWER – Mr Davies: Bigger vessels may have the power to go slightly more than that, but they’re limited by the hydrodynamics of the net. QUESTION – Ms Kelly: A little bit less sometimes? ANSWER – Mr Davies: Down to two and a half knots, I believe they would still hold their shape – the nets. QUESTION – Ms Kelly: But if you go below that optimum fishing speed, the nets collapse, do they? ANSWER – Mr Davies: Yes, and the boards – the otter boards would fall in and start to bog and cause hazards.’ 51                  In re-examination, Mr Davies said this: ‘QUESTION – Mr Macliver: Mr Davies, you said in answer to a question from my learned friend that you consider the minimum trawling speed would be two and a half knots? ANSWER – Mr Davies: In my experience, that’s as slow as I’ve ever seen equipment being able to maintain its shape, its integrity. QUESTION – Mr Macliver: And when you say a trawling speed of two and a half knots, are you talking about ground speed or speed through the water? ANSWER – Mr Davies: Speed through the water. 52                  Based on this evidence, I find that the range of speeds necessary for the Mitra to successfully trawl for fish is between three and four knots, through the water. Conclusion – the Mitra was not being used for commercial fishing in the AFZ 53                  The evidence as to the effect that the tide had on the Mitra’s speed and direction during the relevant period of 5 hours and 42 minutes (see above) is ambiguous.  It is not clear to me whether Mr Davison’s evidence that: “these conditions had been experienced for the previous twelve hours” is intended to refer to the prevailing current being at one knot, or the direction that the tidal current was flowing, or both, or neither.  In my view it is unlikely that the tidal current was flowing in the same direction for the whole of the twelve hour period.  However, even if I were to assume: (a)    that the tide was flowing at one knot; (b)   in the same direction; (c)    for the whole twelve hour period described by Mr Davison; and  (d)   that this tidal current was therefore moving the Mitra forward through the water at one knot; the highest combined average speed that the Mitra would have reached through the water would have been 2.8 knots (that is, the 1.8 knots maximum speed shown on the VMS data and the 1 knot tidal current).  This may have occurred in stage (b) (described in [46(b)] above).  Otherwise, the Mitra would have been travelling at a maximum combined average speed of between 1.1 knots and 1.9 knots throughout this period (that is, in stages (c) described in [46(c)] above and (d) described in [46(d)] above).  I therefore conclude that at no time during this 5 hour and 42 minute period was the Mitra travelling at the requisite average speed range through the water to allow it to successfully trawl for fish.   54                  Of course, this leaves open the possibility that the Mitra moved at a higher speed during a part of one of these stages. However, because of the relatively low range of average speeds shown in the VMS data and the frequency at which those average speeds were plotted by Mr Stroud, I consider it most unlikely that the Mitra moved at between 3 to 4 knots for any sustained period such that it could have been used for commercial fishing. 55                  On the contrary, based on the VMS data, it seems that during this entire period the speed and direction of the Mitra is more consistent with a sudden slowing at about 30 minutes before midnight on 29 March 2008, as would occur if the engine were turned off, and then a gradual loss of forward momentum and a drift under the influence of the tidal current very slowly eastward until the tide changed, and then a drift very slowly on the tide back in a west-south-westerly direction.  This series of movements is generally consistent with the evidence of the Master and the crew (above) that the Mitra was not used for fishing during this period, instead the engine on the Mitra was inoperative as the engineers were working on it.  Conversely, it is directly inconsistent with AFMA’s submissions, based upon the observations made by the boarding party, that the Mitra had been used for commercial fishing at some time during the three to four hours prior to the boarding (since approximately 0100 hours local time when the VMS data shows it was generally drifting eastwards at between 0.1 and 0.9 knots).   56                  It follows from all of this evidence, that AFMA has failed to establish on the balance of probabilities, by way of clear and cogent evidence, that the Mitra was being used for commercial fishing in the AFZ in contravention of s 100(2) of the Act.   DID THE MASTER MAKE A REASONABLE MISTAKE OF FACT? 57                  The second central issue for determination is whether AFMA has established that the Mitra was not at a place within the AFZ as a result of a reasonable mistake of fact on the part of the Master under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code. On this issue AFMA submits that: a.       The Master did not make a mistake about a fact, being his position, but rather he made a mistake about a matter of law, being the location of the AFZ border, or the AFZ itself; or b.      If the Master did make a mistake about a fact, his mistaken belief was not reasonable in all the circumstances. Not surprisingly, the owners put the contrary of these two submissions. It is therefore necessary to consider the evidence as to the nature of the Master’s mistake, whether that mistake was a mistake of fact or law, and, if it was a mistake of fact, whether it was a mistaken but reasonable belief within the terms of s 9.2 of the Criminal Code. The Master’s mistake 58                  The evidence detailing the mistake of fact made by the Master was obviously given by the Master himself.  The background leading up to the mistake begins in October 2006, when a new ‘Seafarer 12, 6th Generation’ GPS (‘Seafarer GPS’) was installed on the Mitra.  At the time of that installation, all the mapping information (geographical and political), including two electronic chart cards, was pre-programmed into the Seafarer GPS by the manufacturer.  The Master said in the affidavit he affirmed on 30 April 2008 that he did not program the Seafarer GPS in any way because he did not know how to.  In his affidavit affirmed on 20 May 2008 he said that the Taiwanese GPS supplier told him that: “There is a line inside the Seafarer GPS.  You can view the line at 10-20 nautical mile view and that line is the Australian border line”.  59                  In fact, as has been established by the evidence in these proceedings, the line that the Taiwanese GPS supplier referred to represented the ‘10 degrees south line’. And, while it varied depending upon the location of the baselines from which it was measured, the Australian or AFZ border was in fact approximately 20 nautical miles further north of that 10 degrees south line.  60                  The Master also said in his affidavit of 20 May 2008 that he generally only used a paper chart in two circumstances: when he was sailing from Taiwan to Indonesian waters and back he used an Indonesian chart; and when he was sailing to a pre-arranged point at sea to collect or drop off Chinese fishermen, he used a Chinese chart. Otherwise, he relied solely on the GPS when he was fishing.  He said that the GPS was easy to use to input and plot the route on screen.   61                  The Master said in his final affidavit affirmed on 28 May 2008 that there was a number of levels of view available within the GPS and they ranged from a 5 nautical mile view to a 100 nautical mile view.  He said he generally used the 20 nautical mile view when travelling from Taiwan to Indonesian waters.  Once in Indonesian waters, because there are many small islands in the Indonesian Archipelago, he said he believed it much safer to use a low nautical mile view so that the obstacles and details of the waters could be viewed.  Thus, while fishing in Indonesian waters he usually used the “han sing tu” (navigation mode) at a 5 nautical mile view.  He also gave evidence that the GPS contained an ‘A - B line function’, which allowed him to plot a route from point A to point B and to measure the distance between those two points. 62                  In his affidavit affirmed on 30 April 2008 the Master described his trip south on 29 March 2008 in these terms: “As the Mitra was moving closer to Australian waters, a big red line appeared on the screen of the Mitra’s navigation system.  On the upper side of the red line, the chart was marked light blue.  On the lower side of the red line, it was marked with green hatching”.  He said further: “I thought that this was the border between Indonesian waters and Australian waters.  The line was located in the geographical area where I understood the border to be located.  I did not have any other information to tell me where Australian waters began, only the red line.  I looked to see if I could find any information on the ship but could not locate any”. 63                  In his affidavit affirmed on 20 May 2008, the Master clarified that in this latter statement he was actually describing what happened after the Mitra had been boarded, rather than when he was heading south. About what happened after the boarding he said: “I could not believe that I was in Australian water already so my first response was to find my Indonesian chart in the cabin to see whether there was an Australian border line on it that I might have missed. I was stopped by the officer who followed me to the cabin from the wheelhouse. I had found no information then.”  64                  Not surprisingly, the Master was asked in cross-examination whether he checked with any paper charts after he saw the “red line” on the GPS when he was heading south. His answer was that he did not, he said: “I believe the GPS with the red line.  I didn’t look at some other paper, you know, chart to be sure of anything.” 65                  The Master said in his affidavit affirmed on 30 April 2008, that at about 1130 hours local time on 29 March 2008 (this has been converted to local time since it emerged in his later affidavit that the times in this affidavit were given in Taiwanese time), he stopped the Mitra approximately 11 nautical miles north of the red line.  He said: “I believed that this was a safe distance from Australian waters”.  He said that he did not know that he was in the AFZ until the boarding party boarded the Mitra and that he was very surprised and therefore argued with one of the officers in the boarding party, “[b]y pointing to the GPS screen showing the Mitra position above the red line”. This is consistent with his interview with CPOB Manley shortly after the Mitra was boarded (see [29] above). 66                  In his affidavit affirmed on 20 May 2008, the Master said with reference to the trip south: “During the escape sail on 29 March 2008, I used the 10 nautical mile view first and I could not see a line. I therefore switched to a 20 nautical mile view and then I could see a red line which had net-like lines underneath. I believed that the red line was the border line and so I stayed at this view”.  While he did not mention the 10 or 20 nautical mile views in this version, it is broadly consistent with his earlier version (above). 67                  However, in his final affidavit affirmed on 28 May 2008 the Master said that before he began to sail south on 29 March 2008, he first checked for any dangers at the 5 nautical mile view and then “switched to a 10, then 20 nautical mile view to look for the ‘border line’.  At the 20 nautical mile view, [he] saw the red line that [he] believed to be the border”.  Further, he said in that affidavit that: “To ensure the border line was in view on the screen, I stayed at the 20 nautical mile view until the end of the sail.  I measured the distance of the ship to the border line by using the A-B line function under navigation mode after I stopped the ship.” 68                  AFMA has pointed to the inconsistency between the first two versions (above) and this last version, on the timing of first looking for and seeing the ‘red line’. However, since it relates to an insignificant and peripheral aspect of the event, I do not consider this inconsistency to be of any moment. 69                  In his affidavit affirmed on 20 May 2008, the Master described the final stages of his voyage south as follows: “After a few hours of high speed sailing towards the red line, I saw on the GPS screen that the ship was getting close to the red line.  I stopped the speed and then measured the distance of the ship position (A) to the red line (B) by moving the cross (cursor) on the screen to the red line and then pressing down the “A B” key on the GPS machine.  The distance of the A – B line appeared on the bottom right corner of the screen as approximately 11 nautical miles.” He also described his use of the A-B key in his affidavit of 28 May 2008. 70                  The Master annexed to his affidavit dated 20 May 2008 (as annexure TSJ 3), a photograph of the GPS screen on the Mitra on the day of seizure with the A – B line and the distance of 11.61 nautical miles both clearly shown.  This photograph is similar to a photograph annexed to the affidavit of CPOB Manley, the officer in charge of the boarding party, so I infer that it was taken by one of the Navy personnel shortly after boarding the Mitra.  It provides clear evidence that the Master had used the ‘A-B’ key on the GPS to set his position 11.61 nautical miles north of the red line, as claimed. 71                  Based on this evidence, I find that the Master’s fundamental mistake was in thinking that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS represented the location of the AFZ border. In making that mistake he adopted the mistaken statement of the Taiwanese GPS supplier, that the line inside the GPS at the 10 – 20 nautical mile view was the Australian or AFZ border. Acting on that mistaken belief, he placed the Mitra at a position approximately 11.61 nautical miles north of the ‘red line’, thereby mistakenly thinking that the Mitra would be north of the AFZ border and therefore outside the AFZ.  Was the Master’s a mistake of law? 72                  Having identified the nature of the Master’s mistake, the next question I have to determine is whether that mistake was a mistake of fact or law. On this issue, AFMA submits that the Master made a mistake of law. It submits that this is so because the Master thought that the red line, in fact the 10 degrees south line, was the border of Australian waters and he was therefore mistaken as to the location of the Australian or AFZ border, which it says was a mistake of law.  AFMA says the Master was not mistaken as to his geographic location, which could have been a mistake of fact. Accordingly it says that the Master’s mistake was not a mistaken belief as to an element of the offences under ss 100 or 101 of the Act.  Finally it says that the Master believed the advice he received when the Seafarer GPS was installed - that the red line was the boundary of Australian waters - and this advice was a statement as to the location of that boundary, a matter of law.   73                  In making its submissions, AFMA relied heavily upon the High Court’s decision in Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; (2004) 218 CLR 493 (‘Ostrowski’).  In that case, Mr Palmer, the respondent, was the lessee of a commercial fishing licence which allowed him to fish for rock lobsters in a particular zone (Zone B) of a managed fishery in Western Australia.  During November of 1998, Mr Palmer made a number of visits to the Fremantle office of the West Australian Fisheries Department (‘Fisheries WA’) to obtain information about the regulations relating to Zone B.  He eventually obtained a copy of a number of documents, but none of those documents mentioned Regulation 34, which provided that: “A person who is the holder of a commercial fishing licence must not fish for rock lobsters at any time in the area described in the table to this regulation”.  The table identified an area in the vicinity of Quobba Point in Western Australia where commercial fishing licensees were not licensed to fish for rock lobster.  Mr Palmer proceeded on the mistaken assumption that he had been fully advised as to the regulations specifying where he could fish.  He remained ignorant of Regulation 34 relating to Quobba Point.   74                  During February of 1999, Mr Palmer placed a number of rock lobster pots near Quobba Point within the waters described in the table to Regulation 34.  He knew the true position of his pots and he intended to fish for rock lobster in that area, but he was not aware until he was informed by officers of Fisheries WA, that he was not able to fish legally in that area.  Mr Palmer was subsequently charged with a breach of Regulation 34.  In his defence, he claimed that he had been operating under a mistake of fact, within the terms of s 24 of the Western Australian Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)(‘Criminal Code WA’).  That section is similar in terms (although not identical) to s 9.2 of the Criminal Code.  The Criminal Code WA also contains a provision (s 22) to the effect that ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for an act or omission which would otherwise constitute an offence unless knowledge of the law by the offender is expressly declared to be an element of the offence.  S 22 is similar in terms to s 9.3 of the Criminal Code which provides: “A person can be criminally responsible for an offence even if, at the time of the conduct constituting the offence, he or she is mistaken about, or ignorant of, the existence or content of an Act that directly or indirectly creates the offence or directly or indirectly affects the scope or operation of the offence.”   75                  The High Court held that Mr Palmer was acting in ignorance of the law, namely that he did not know he could not legally fish at Quobba Point, rather than acting upon any mistake of fact.  In their decision Gleeson CJ and Kirby J described Mr Palmer’s predicament in these terms: “He knew he held a commercial fishing licence; he knew he was fishing for rock lobster; and he knew where he was fishing…What he did not know was that there was a regulation prohibiting his conduct.  He was fishing where he intended to fish; he did not know there was a law against it” (at [6]).  76                  In his decision, McHugh J emphasised that Mr Palmer did not make a mistake about a factual element of the charge but rather he made a mistake about the law as to where he could fish legally. He said (at [49]): “His mistake was that he believed that the law of Western Australia did not prohibit or regulate fishing for rock lobsters in that area.  His mistaken belief was not a mistake as to a fact or “state of things”, but a mistake as to the operation of the law.  His case fell within s 22, not s 24, of the Criminal Code.  It was ignorance of the law that caused him to make the mistake that he did...”. Justices Callinan and Heydon came to a similar conclusion (at [90]).  77                  It is of some significance to the present case that their Honours said the following circumstances may constitute a mistake of fact: “if, as a result of navigational error, [Mr Palmer] had been under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief as to his location” (per Gleeson CJ and Kirby J at [11]), and “a mistake as to the location of his vessel or his lobster pots” (per Callinan and Heydon JJ at [90]). 78                  In Handmer v Taylor [1971] VR 308 (‘Handmer’), McInerney J had to consider whether a man who had felled timber in a “protected forest” was operating under a mistake belief on reasonable grounds. The expression “protected forest” was defined in the Forests Act 1958 (Vic) to include: “all unoccupied Crown land proclaimed as a protected forest … and every unused road and every water frontage as defined in ... the Land Act 1958”.  His Honour held that questions of whether a particular area of land is Crown land; or unoccupied; or a road or an unused road; or a water frontage; or reserved from sale; or vested in trustees; or a municipality; or leased or licensed; or a water reserve under the Land Act 1958 (Vic), are all questions of fact (at 309 – 310).  79                  To similar effect, in Gibbon v Fitzmaurice (1986) 23 A Crim R 12 (‘Gibbon’)at 19, Nettlefold J said, without referring to authority, that “a mistake as to whether a given piece of land is inside or outside of the reserve boundary is a question of fact”. In that case the Full Court was dealing with an offence involving an area of land reserved as a national park.  80                  In support of his conclusions in Handmer, McInerney J referred to High Court decisions where various questions have been held to be questions of fact, as follows:  (a)    whether a divorce decree had been entered in court: see Thomas v The King (1937) 59 CLR 279 (‘Thomas’) at 286 per Latham CJ and at 307 per Dixon J.; and (b)   whether an Act of Parliament had been passed or repealed (as distinct from the legal effect of it); whether or not a particular house was rent controlled; and the content of a Foreign law: see Iannella v French (1967) 119 CLR 84 (‘Iannella’) at 97 per Barwick CJ and at 115–116 per Windeyer J.  However, some of these propositions are not without controversy. In Iannella, Taylor J said that he thought the first proposition in (b) above was “heresy of the first order” (see 101, with Owen J agreeing at 116).    81                  In Thomas, Latham CJ went on to say (at 286) that a mistaken belief that the defendant’s prior marriage had not been effectually dissolved would have been a mistake of law. This statement was referred to by McHugh J in Ostrowski following which his Honour concluded that “… it is no defence to a criminal charge that the defendant believed that his or her actions were not regulated by law or that his or her actions satisfied the provisions of a law” (at [45] – [46]).  82                  The issue becomes more complicated where the mistake involves a compound event involving both fact and law. Again in Thomas, Dixon J (at 306) concluded that such compound mistakes will generally be classified as mistakes of fact. His Honour referred in support (at 306 – 307) to the observations of the Jessel MR in Eaglesfield v Marquis of Londonderry (1876) 4 Ch D 693 (‘Eaglesfield’)to the effect that a simple statement that a woman is “a single woman” is a statement of fact, but a series of statements that the woman had married, discovered the man she had married was a married man and that therefore the marriage was void, followed by a statement that “therefore she is a single woman”, is a statement of law. McHugh J referred to this distinction in Ostrowski (at [43] fn 72). 83                  In Power v Huffa (1976) 14 SASR 337 (‘Power’), Bray CJ reached the opposite conclusion in dealing with the case of a woman who claimed she had been authorised by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to remain at the scene of a public protest. His Honour held that the woman’s belief that the Minister’s authority was lawful was a mistake of law, observing that “if one of the components vital to the total belief is a belief on a question of law …” then the mistaken belief is a mistake of law (at 344 – 346, with Jacobs J agreeing at 356).  84                  Again in Ostrowski, McHugh J (at [35]) referred with apparent approval to the statement of Dixon J in Thomas (at 306), as did Callinan and Heydon JJ (at [87]). However, in a footnote to [35], McHugh J pointed to the decision of Gleeson CJ in Stratfield Municipal Council v Elvy (1992) 25 NSWLR 745 (‘Elvy’) at 751 (Clarke JA and Lee A-J concurring), which is to the opposite effect.  In their decision in Ostrowski, Gleeson CJ and Kirby J (at [13]) decided that they did not need to address “the difficulties that are sometimes involved in distinguishing between mistakes of law and mistakes of fact.” and referred to Elvy and Von Lieven v Stewart (1990) 21 NSWLR 52 (‘Von Lieven’) at 66 – 67.  85                  In Elvy, Gleeson CJ was dealing with the failure by a member of a municipal council to declare a pecuniary interest before voting on a matter. His Honour was not willing to accept that members of a council, being aware of the primary facts giving rise to a pecuniary interest calling for disclosure, could determine for themselves whether they had to disclose and then claim that they were acting under a mistake of fact if they were wrong. He said, “Once one goes past the relevant primary facts, such questions of opinion and degree … as to what kind of interest one is obliged by statute to disclose; these are mixed questions of fact and law … [which] would not ordinarily constitute mistakes of fact”. 86                  In Von Lieven, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that the belief by a promoter of a scheme operated through a company, that it did not contravene any of the relevant codes was a mistake of law because it involved a mistaken belief as to the legal effect of the facts constituting the offence: see Clarke JA at 55 and Handley JA 66 – 67.    87                  Finally, it is a commonplace proposition, stated in numerous authorities, that whether a particular thing or place answers a particular description in a statute is a question of law: see, for example, Iannella at 116 per Windeyer J.  88                  Based upon these authorities, I consider that AFMA’s submissions must be rejected. The Master mistakenly thought that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS was the AFZ borderline and that by taking up a position approximately 11.61 nautical miles north of that ‘red line’, he would be outside the AFZ. This mistaken belief was in turn based upon the mistaken statement of the Taiwanese GPS supplier that the line inside the GPS was the Australian border line. The only line that the Master saw was the ‘red line’ and he assumed this was the line the Taiwanese GPS supplier was referring to. 89                  In this sense I agree with one of AFMA’s submissions, that is, the Master was not mistaken as to his geographic location. He knew where he was located in relation to the ‘red line’; in fact he plotted it carefully using the A-B key on the GPS. However, he thought that by being in that location he would be outside the AFZ. Thus his mistake was, in a sense, the vicarious mistake of the Taiwanese GPS supplier, in thinking that the line in the GPS, or the ‘red line’, was the AFZ border. In determining whether the Master’s mistake was one of law or fact, I therefore consider it is necessary to focus on the nature of the underlying mistake of the Taiwanese GPS supplier. 90                  The Taiwanese GPS supplier’s underlying mistake did not constitute a statement that the Master had a legal entitlement to do something, or was not acting unlawfully by doing something, as arose in Ostrowski, Power, Elvy, and Von Lieven. That is, it was not a statement as to the meaning or effect of a law drawn from a process of reasoning based upon a stated, or unstated, set of facts.  It is therefore quite different to the example of a question of law, given by Jessel MR in Eaglesfield, where a person makes a series of statements about the marriage history of a particular woman and concludes with the statement as to legal effect of those statements: “therefore she is a single woman”. Conversely, it is somewhat similar to the contrasting example of a question of fact, where a person simply states that a particular woman is “a single woman”. 91                  Furthermore, it was a statement about a particular physical phenomenon, namely the location of the Australian or AFZ border.  It is therefore more akin to the questions of fact identified in Handmer as to whether an area of land was Crown land, or a part of a road, or a water frontage – here the question is whether an area of sea was part of the AFZ. It is also akin to the examples of mistakes of fact given in Ostrowski, as to the location of his vessel or his lobster pots, albeit that here it was the physical location of the AFZ border, rather than the Mitra’s physical location. 92                  It is very similar to the question of whether an area of land is inside a reserve boundary, which was stated to be a question of fact in Gibbon. This is undoubtedly so because the location of a boundary, such as the AFZ border, is the sort of thing that is usually determined (as it was in this case) by a process of measurement (in this case using a GPS). It is therefore usually proved by adducing evidence of that process of measurement or, as also occurred in this case, by tendering an official chart showing the AFZ border position. Of course, an official chart simply shows the final results of the process of measurement carried out by a relevant official.   93                  In this case, there can be no suggestion of ignorance of the law as arose in Ostrowski. Unlike Mr Palmer, the Master knew he was not legally entitled to fish in or, with some irrelevant exceptions, to be in the AFZ. Indeed that is exactly what he was attempting to avoid by locating the Mitra where he did. Or, to state the matter within the specific terms of s 9.3 of the Criminal Code, the Master was not mistaken about or ignorant of the existence or content of the Act.  94                  For these reasons, I consider that the Master’s mistake was not a mistake of law. Rather, within the terms in s 9.2 of the Criminal Code, it was a mistake about whether or not a fact existed (the location of the AFZ border) which, if it had existed as he mistakenly thought (if the ‘red line’ were in fact the AFZ border), the Mitra’s location would have been 11.6 nautical miles north of the AFZ border and therefore would not have constituted an offence under ss 101(2) or 100(2) of the Act. The fact that his mistake was based upon what he had been told by the Taiwanese GPS supplier does not alter this conclusion.  Was the Master’s mistake of fact reasonable? 95                  Having identified the nature of the Master’s mistake and having rejected AFMA’s submissions that his mistake was a mistake of law, and instead having found it to be a mistake of fact, the final question I have to determine is whether the Master’s mistake of fact was reasonable within the terms of s 9.2 of the Criminal Code. 96                  On this question, AFMA submit that the Master’s mistaken belief was not reasonable because: (a)    his evidence that he held the mistaken belief was not credible; (b)   there was a number of specific matters that should reasonably have alerted him to the fact the ‘red line’ was not the AFZ border; and (c)    in all the circumstances known to him at the time he should reasonably have made enquiries which would have revealed his mistake. Did the Master have a mistaken belief? 97                  The first question raised by these submissions is: did the Master have an actual mistaken belief? I need to briefly refer to the legal principles on this issue before briefly considering the facts. 98                  Both the terms of s 9.2 of the Criminal Code and authority dating as far back as Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536 (‘Proudman v Dayman’) require that the Master’s mistake must constitute an affirmative belief as to the fact in question; inadvertence, a mere absence of knowledge, or not turning one’s mind to the issue, is not sufficient: see Proudman at 541 per Dixon J, State Rail Authority of NSW v Hunter Water Board (1992) 28 NSWLR 721 (‘SRA’) at 725 per Gleeson CJ, Clough v Rosevear (1997) 69 SASR 67 at  73 – 74 per Duggan J and CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25 (‘CTM’) at [7] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. 99                  AFMA’s submission on this question proceeds from the proposition that I should not accept the Master as a witness of credit and should therefore not believe his claim that he thought that the ‘red line’ was the Australian, or AFZ, border.  For the reasons I have given above, in considering whether the Mitra was used for commercial fishing and in considering the nature of the Master’s mistake, I reject this submission. 100               Furthermore, for the same reasons, I find that the Master did have an actual belief that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS represented the location of the AFZ border. In my view, this is not a case of inadvertence, or a mere absence of knowledge.   Was the Master’s mistaken belief reasonable? 101               The next question raised by these submissions is: was the Master’s actual mistaken belief, as stated, reasonable? On this question AFMA raises two specific questions: were there matters that should reasonably have alerted the Master to his mistake; and did the circumstances reasonably require the Master to make enquiries that would have revealed his mistake? To begin with, these questions require me to consider what the word ‘reasonable’ means and what it requires in the context of s 9.2 of the Criminal Code.  102               Section 9.2 of the Criminal Code reflects the so-called Proudman v Dayman defence at common law.  So much is clear from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of the Attorneys-General contained in its report on the Model Criminal Code dated December 1992, which formed the basis of the Criminal Code that was eventually adopted by the Australian Parliament: see Criminal Law Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of the Attorneys-General, Final Report, December 1992, page 55, paragraph 307 Mistake of Fact (Strict Liability); Explanatory Memorandum, Criminal Code Bill 1994 (Cth) at page 1; and Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, Senate, Criminal Code Bill 1994, Second Reading, 30 June 1994, 2379-2382 (Senator Crowley, Minister for Family Services).  The Committee’s report also explains that the word ‘honest’ was deliberately excluded from ss 9.1 and 9.2 of the Criminal Code because it was considered redundant for offences where no fault element is involved: see page 55, paragraph 306.  103               Proudman v Dayman was a case involving a charge of permitting an unlicensed person to drive a motor vehicle.  In that case, Dixon J said that: “An honest belief founded on reasonable grounds that he is licensed”, afforded to the defendant “an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence” (at 540).  The statement that the belief should be “founded on reasonable grounds” is consistent with what had earlier been said by Stephen J in R v Tolson (1889) 23 QBD 168 at 179.  It was re-stated in those terms in the House of Lords in Sweet v Parsley [1970] AC 132 at 165, and in the High Court of Australia in He Kaw Teh at 558–559 per Wilson J and at 592 per Dawson J. 104               In the Criminal Code jurisdictions of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, the defence of acting under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken belief, has been said to reflect the common law with “complete accuracy”: see Thomas at 305 – 306 per Dixon J and CTM at [3] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. Different judges of the Western Australian Court of Appeal (and the Full Court) have described the expression “honest and reasonable belief” (in s 24 of the West Australian Criminal Code) in the following terms: (a)    “…it must be reasonable, which is to say that it must be based on his appreciation of primary objective fact which is in reason capable of sustaining the belief …”, in GJ Coles & Co Ltd v Goldsworthy [1985] WAR 183 at 187 per Burt CJ, Brinsden and Smith JJ; (b)   “… a reasonable man or woman in the position of the defendant carrying out the same actions in the same circumstances may make the same mistake”, in O’Brien v Ostrowski [1999] WASCA 184 at [108] per McKechnie J;  (c)    “It is that belief which must be reasonable; i.e., in all the circumstances it must have been reasonable for the accused person to hold the belief which, in this case, would render his conduct innocent”; and “….it is the actual belief of the accused with which the section is concerned, in judging reasonableness it will always be necessary to advert to the circumstances as they existed at the time in so far as they were known to the accused”, in BRK v R [2001] WASCA 161 at [34] and [36] per Murray J. (d)   “For there to be an operative mistake under s 24, an accused must have acted under an actual belief in the existence of a state of things (subjective element) and the accused belief must be reasonable (mixed element) … the mixed element is not wholly objective; reasonableness is not to be judged by the standard of the hypothetical ordinary or reasonable person.  The mixed element is a combination of subjective and objective aspects.  The requirement that the belief be reasonable imports an objective standard.  The subjective aspect is that the reasonableness is to be judged by reference to the personal attributes and characteristics of the accused that are capable of affecting his or her appreciation or perception of the circumstances in which he or she found himself or herself”, in Aubertin v Western Australia (2006) 33 WAR 87; [2006] WASCA 229 at [43] per McLure JA (with whom Roberts-Smith JA and Buss JA agreed). 105               The Queensland Court of Appeal considered the equivalent expression (in s 24 of the Queensland Criminal Code 1899 (Qld)) in R v Mrzljak (2005) 1 Qd R 308;(2004) 152 A Crim R 315; [2004] QCA 420, and described it as requiring: (a)    “…a consideration of whether there were reasonable grounds for the belief, not what a reasonable person would have believed” per McMurdo P at [21]; (b)    “…that the critical focus is on the offender rather than the theoretical reasonable person. It is the information available to the offender which must determine whether the belief was honest and also was reasonable …” per Williams JA at [53]; (c)    that “[t]he section directs attention to the actual belief of the accused; nothing in its language invites reference to the reasonable man’s putative belief.  What must be considered, in my view, is the reasonableness of an accused’s belief based on the circumstances as he perceived them to be”, per Holmes JA at [81]. 106               From these authorities it is apparent that the word ‘reasonable’ in s 9.2: (a)    does not involve the hypothetical ordinary or reasonable person test; (b)   requires that the belief be that of the accused;  (c)    requires that the accused’s belief be objectively reasonable i.e. rational, based on reason, or capable of sustaining belief; and  (d)   requires the objective reasonableness of the accused’s belief to be assessed by reference to the subjective circumstances in which the accused was placed, including the accused’s personal attributes and the information available to him or her at the time. 107               In my view, the two specific questions raised by AFMA require particular consideration of the matters in (c) and (d) above i.e. the rationality of the Master’s mistaken belief by reference to his personal attributes and the information available to him at the time.  108               The first question i.e. were there matters that should reasonably have alerted the Master to his mistake; in my view, quite properly calls for a consideration of the information the Master actually considered at or about the time he formed his mistaken belief, in assessing whether his mistaken belief was rational or capable of being sustained. In making that assessment it is necessary to have regard to the Master’s personal attributes. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that this assessment does not involve any consideration of the information a reasonable person would have considered in the circumstances. 109               However, in my view, AFMA’s second question i.e. did the circumstances reasonably require the Master to make enquiries that would have revealed his mistake; is not consistent with the approach outlined in the authorities referred to above. It is inconsistent because it seeks to introduce into the assessment a consideration of the information a reasonable person would have obtained by enquiry, rather than the information the Master had actually obtained, or actually had available to him, at the time he formed his belief. Moreover, in my view, such a requirement would be likely to render nugatory the defence of mistake of fact under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code because the reasonable person’s enquiries are, of necessity, almost always likely to reveal the mistake.  110               In my view, therefore, the information the Master had actually obtained, or actually had available to him, at the time he formed his belief, is the only information that is relevant in assessing whether his mistaken belief was rational or capable of being sustained. This is not to say that it is impermissible to consider why the Master failed to have regard to certain information actually available to him when he formed his mistaken belief. It would seem that a question along the lines of: ‘did the Master unreasonably fail to have regard to any information that was available to him at the time that would have revealed his mistake’, would be permissible. Of course, in making that assessment it remains necessary to have regard to the Master’s personal attributes. Since this may be what AFMA intends by its second question, I will consider this issue hereunder. But, first, I will deal with AFMA’s first question. Was there any information that should have alerted the Master to his mistake? 111               Before considering the information the Master actually considered in forming his mistaken belief, it is necessary to identify the relevant circumstances in which he was placed and his relevant attributes. It appears to be common ground between the parties that the relevant circumstances were that: the Mitra was heading at a fast speed due south; the Master knew he was approaching the AFZ border; the Master knew that the Mitra was not permitted to enter or pass through the AFZ without fishing gear stowed; and the Master had not been in the area before.  112               It also appears to be common ground between the parties that the relevant attributes the Master possessed were that he was experienced as a fisherman and as the Master of the Mitra and he had particular experience with the use of the GPS on the Mitra, including its electronic charts. Further, he was not able to read or speak English. 113               AFMA pointed to four items of information the Master must have actually considered at or before the time he formed his mistaken belief, which should reasonably have alerted him to the fact that the ‘red line’ was not the AFZ borderline or, in other words, that demonstrated that his mistaken belief was not rational or capable of being sustained. 114               First, AFMA submitted that the ‘red line’ (which was in fact the same as the ten degrees south line), was a continuous straight line.  It submitted that the Master, with his 34 years experience as a sailor, 18 years experience as a Master and 3.5 years experience as Master of the Mitra, should have realised that the border between Indonesian and Australian waters was not a continuous straight line because it was dependent upon the distance between the respective coastlines.  As a result, they submitted the Master should have been alerted to the possibility that the ‘red line’ was not the border between Indonesian and Australian waters. 115               In my view, this submission is misconceived.  The boundary of Australian waters (and therefore the AFZ) and the boundary of Indonesian waters is not set by reference to the distance between the coastlines of Australia and Indonesia.  Instead, the boundary of the AFZ (which is the same as Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone), is set by reference to a distance of no more than 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which Australia’s territorial sea is measured, as described in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea(see [12] above). In Australia’s case those baselines were declared in the Commonwealth Government Gazette Number S 29dated 9 February 1983. Furthermore, the AFZ boundary is in fact a continuous straight line for large distances along its course as shown in the official charts, AUS 410 and AUS 311, tendered in evidence.  I do not therefore consider that this was a matter that should reasonably have alerted the Master to the fact that the ‘red line’ was not the AFZ borderline.  116               Secondly, AFMA submitted that given the Master’s experience as a Master and particularly his experience as the Master of the Mitra, he should have realised that the cross-hatching on the GPS screen (he was using on 29/30 March 2008) south of the ‘red line’ indicated that the ‘red line’ was the border of the GPS chart, rather than the AFZ borderline.  AFMA says there was no other obvious purpose for this cross-hatching. 117               In his evidence, the Master said that he had not seen the cross-hatching on the GPS chart before 29 March 2008.  I have no reason to disbelieve the Master on this evidence and that being so, I fail to see how this cross-hatching should reasonably have alerted the Master to his mistake. Its presence was just as consistent with signifying that part of the chart was Australian waters, as he mistakenly thought.  Conversely, there was nothing in the nature of the cross-hatching which, in my view, should reasonably have alerted the Master to the fact that the ‘red line’ represented the boundary of the GPS chart.   118               Thirdly, AFMA submitted that there were other charts within the GPS that showed red lines and that this should reasonably have alerted the Master to the fact that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS chart he was using on 29/30 March 2008 was not the AFZ borderline.  While the Master admitted that he had seen red lines before, on other GPS charts he had used, he said in his affidavit affirmed on 28 May 2008, that he “… did not understand them as individual charts until I was told on the third day of the hearing of this proceedings.  However, I have never seen them in navigation mode while sailing in Indonesian waters”.  Bearing in mind that the Master said elsewhere in his evidence that he had been using navigation mode on 29/30 March 2008, I do not consider that the presence of red lines on other GPS charts should reasonably have alerted him to the possibility that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS chart he was using in navigation mode on 29/30 March 2008 was not the AFZ borderline. 119               Fourthly, AFMA submitted that cross-hatching similar to the cross-hatching shown on the GPS chart that the Master was using on 29/30 March 2008, is also present on the ‘north of the 50 nautical mile’ view for the GPS chart covering the area from the Philippines to Taiwan (as shown in tendered photograph 8 of the GPS screen views); and on the 20 nautical mile view for the GPS charts covering the area from Taiwan to Indonesia (as shown in tendered photograph 9 of the GPS screen views).  AFMA submitted that since the Master gave evidence that he had used the 50 nautical mile view chart on occasions to check his position and that he had more often used the 20 nautical mile view chart, he must have seen this cross-hatching before. Accordingly, this should reasonably have alerted him to the fact that the cross-hatching on all of the GPS charts, including the one he was using on 29/30 March 2008 signified the boundaries of the GPS charts and therefore the ‘red line’ was not in fact the AFZ borderline. 120               In his affidavit affirmed on 28 May 2008, the Master comments on each of the tendered photographs of the GPS screen views, including photographs 8 and 9.  Strangely, the Master does not expressly comment on the cross-hatching shown on the 50 nautical mile screen view (photograph 8).  Instead, he says “I only ever used a up to [sic] 50 nautical mile view to quickly check the route for islands the Mitra might be approaching and then sail [sic] at a 5 nautical mile view most of the time”.  However, in the same affidavit he denied having ever seen the screen view shown on the 20 nautical mile screen view (photograph 9).  I accept the Master’s denial in this respect.  As to the 50 nautical mile screen view (photograph 8), even if I were to infer from the Master’s silence on this subject that he had seen the cross-hatching on the northern side of that chart, I do not consider this could constitute clear and cogent evidence that he should therefore have been alerted to the fact that the cross-hatching on all GPS charts, including the one he was using on 29/30 March 2008, signified the boundaries of the GPS charts and therefore the ‘red line’ was not in fact the AFZ borderline. In my view, there is no necessary logical connection between the two.   121               For these reasons, I reject all of AFMA’s submissions that there was information the Master must have actually considered at or before the time he formed his mistaken belief which should reasonably have alerted the Master to his mistake, such that his mistaken belief was not rational or capable of being sustained. Did the Master fail to have regard to any information that would have revealed his mistake? 122               It remains to consider AFMA’s second question, in the form I consider permissible on the authorities. That question is: did the Master unreasonably fail to have regard to any information that was available to him at the time, which would have revealed his mistake, such that his mistaken belief was not rational or capable of sustaining belief? In posing its second question, AFMA relied upon two items of information that it says were actually available to the Master at the time. They were:  (a)    the charts AUS 410 and 311 that were present on the Mitra - particularly the former which showed the AFZ borderline in the area where the Mitra was boarded; and  (b)   the availability of other Taiwanese fishing vessels by radio contact. 123               In my view the general answer to the Master’s failure to have regard to these two items of information is that there was nothing in the circumstances that reasonably required him to do so. While he knew he was heading at speed towards the AFZ border, he knew he was not permitted to cross into the AFZ and he had not been in the area before, he was reasonably relying upon what he had been told by the Taiwanese GPS supplier about what he should do in such circumstances i.e. look for a line in the GPS. Once he found the ‘red line’ and assumed that was the line he had been told to look for, it was reasonable for him to continue to follow his usual practice of solely relying upon the GPS.  124               Indeed AFMA did not really suggest otherwise. The crux of its complaint was that the Master should have followed the precaution of cross checking his GPS with a paper chart, or by radio enquiry with another fishing vessel.  125               While it is true that a more cautious master might have taken one or both of these precautions, that is not the test. The test is whether it was reasonable for this Master in these circumstances to form the mistaken belief he did without such cross checking.  126               There is no suggestion the GPS was mal functioning, quite the opposite, he used it to precisely plot the position where he stopped the Mitra i.e. 11.61 nautical miles north of the ‘red line’. Apart from an abundance of caution, there is, in my view, nothing in the circumstances that reasonably required the Master to cross check his GPS by having regard to these two items of information. 127               In any event, even if the Master did have regard to the Australian charts on board the Mitra, or did make radio contact with another Taiwanese fishing vessel, I do not consider that AFMA has established that he would most likely have been alerted to his mistaken belief that the ‘red line’ was the AFZ borderline, for the following reasons: (a)    First, it is common ground that the Master could not read or speak English. It follows that he could not read the English writing on the charts, AUS 410 and AUS 311. (b)   Secondly, even if it were to be assumed that the Master would be able to identify the AFZ borderline marked on chart AUS 410 without being able to read English, to make any use of that information he would have to first realise that the ‘red line’ on the GPS screen was not, in fact, the AFZ borderline as shown on this chart.  Otherwise, it is most likely that he would have simply assumed that the AFZ borderline shown on chart AUS 410 was the same as the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS screen, as he mistakenly thought. In particular, he would have had to realise that the ‘red line’ was in fact the 10 degrees south line and then to realise that the 10 degrees south line shown on chart AUS 410 was not the same as the AFZ borderline shown on chart AUS 410. However, the Master’s evidence, which I accept, was that he did not at any time realise that the ‘red line’ shown on the GPS screen was the 10 degrees south line. For these reasons, I do not consider that even if the Master could have identified the AFZ borderline on chart AUS 410, he would have been alerted to his mistaken belief that the ‘red line’ was the AFZ borderline. (c)    Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, the Master was not cross-examined about what, if any, use he could have made of these Australian charts, or about what, if any, radio enquiries he could have made of other Taiwanese vessels just before midnight on 29 March 2008. In the absence of such cross-examination, I am not willing to infer as AFMA says I should, that the Master could have used these charts to discover his mistake, or that he could have contacted someone at that time of night who would have been able to alert him to his mistake. The unfairness of drawing such inferences where the Master has not been given any opportunity to explain why I should not do so, is obvious.  This is all the more so, where AFMA bears the onus of proving these matters on clear and cogent evidence. CONCLUSION 128               In any assessment like this it is almost inevitable that different minds will come to different conclusions about the reasonableness of Master’s conduct in the  circumstances in which he found himself on 29/30 March 2008: see, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [137] per Gummow J.  However, not without some hesitation, I have concluded that it was reasonable for the Master to proceed as he did in all the circumstances on the mistaken belief that the ‘red line’ was the AFZ borderline. 129               Apart from the many aspects mentioned earlier in these reasons, there are two factors that have influenced me more than others in reaching this conclusion.  The first is the particular conduct which gave rise to the possible offences in this case.  This was not, in my view, a case, where the Master was using the Mitra for commercial fishing in the AFZ and attempting to use the reasonable mistake of fact defence to excuse that conduct.  Here, the primary conduct constituting the offence was the mere presence of the Mitra in the AFZ.  Moreover, while it was in the AFZ, the Mitra was drifting on the tide while the engineers were fixing its engine.  In my view, this conduct is objectively innocent.  It is the very kind of innocent conduct to which the defence under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code is directed: see CTM at [3]-[4].  Indeed there is no sensible reason, apart from mistake, why the Master would have allowed the engineers to fix the Mitra’s engine while it was drifting in the AFZ, knowing that it could be forfeited as a result. 130               The second factor relates to the first.  Given the innocent nature of the conduct in question here, I do not consider it is an affront to the purposes of the Act, to hold that the owners should be excused from criminal responsibility in the circumstances. It is unlikely to lead to any significant erosion of AFMA’s capacity to protect Australia’s fishing resources, or to police the enforcement provisions of the Act. On the other hand, it is entirely consistent with the purpose of s 9.2 of the Criminal Code to hold that the defence of reasonable mistake of fact should be available to excuse it: see CTM at [7].   131               For these reasons I find that AFMA has failed to prove, on the balance of probabilities, based upon clear and cogent evidence that the Mitra was not within the AFZ at the time as a result of a mistaken but reasonable belief of fact, on the part of the Master, under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code.  132               Accordingly I propose to make appropriate declarations in favour of the owners.  I will hear the parties on the form of those orders and costs.     I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-two (132) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Reeves.

29,2703196,R v Weismantel (No 4) [2015] NSWDC 389,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave pursuant to s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The accused makes an application out of time for trial by Judge alone. Such an application must be made 28 days before the day fixed for the trial in this Court unless the Court otherwise grants leave. If that application be successful, there will follow an application under s 132(4) of the same Act for leave to have the matter tried by a Judge alone as the prosecutor does not consent to the making of an order for trial by Judge alone. It is convenient to deal with both applications at the one time.
	
	
	On 23 September 2014, the accused was committed for trial by the Downing Centre Local Court on a number of charges. Six of those charges arose out of events which occurred on 23 September 2013. The current matter arose out of an event which occurred on 31 December 2013. I shall refer to the current matter as the second trial. The first trial is clearly a reference to the matters alleged against the accused as occurring on 23 September 2013. As far as the first trial is concerned the accused was to be tried with a co-offender, Amanda Faith Ridden.
	
	
	The accused was arraigned in respect of the first trial and in respect of the second trial on 24 October 2014. Two indictments were presented, one applicable to the first trial and one applicable to the second trial. The indictment concerning the first trial contained one count against Amanda Faith Ridden, and it contained six counts against both Ridden and the current accused. The first count was that on 23 September 2013 at Lane Cove the accused whilst in company took for the purposes of driving a motor vehicle, a Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, without consent of the owner, Phillip Brighton, whilst Phillip Brighton was in the vehicle. The second count was a count in the alternative to that count. The third and fourth counts allege armed robberies at the Roseville Cinema. The sixth count was of armed robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel on 23 September 2013. The final count was a count that whilst in company the accused did intentionally destroy the Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, the property of Phillip Brighton.
	
	
	After the arraignment the list judge, Acting Judge Delaney, fixed a six week trial commencing on 15 June 2015. There was a direction that the trial on the current charge, that is the second trial, follow immediately after the conclusion of the first trial. The matter came before the Chief Judge, Price J, on 16 June 2015. I am told and have been told earlier that on that day Ridden pleaded guilty to a number of charges after plea bargaining. The Chief Judge stood the current accused’s trial over to 17 June and on 17 June the matter was stood over for trial on 18 June. The matter was supposed to come before me on that day but I was engaged in a civil hearing until 6pm that day. The matter was due to be before me on Friday 19 June but it was convenient for all concerned that the matter commence on Monday 22 June. On that day, the accused was arraigned on a fresh indictment containing six counts against the accused alone, in respect of the events of 23 September 2013. That day was spent on the hearing of an application for the adducing of coincidence evidence. I ruled that the coincidence evidence be admitted. The matter was then adjourned until 23 June 2015 when I was asked to grant the parties time. Eventually, at 2pm a fresh indictment was presented and the accused was arraigned on four counts and pleaded guilty to each of those four counts. There was one count of taking Mr Brighton’s motor vehicle without his consent, he being in the car and three counts of armed robbery. I was asked to stand the back-up trial, namely, this second trial, until Wednesday 24 June at 10am. At the request of the parties I directed that the accused might be excused on Wednesday 24 June 2015. Mr Schaudin, who appears for the accused, told me that he wished to attend upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain certain instructions from him. Unfortunately, he could not do so because the accused was brought to court when it was unnecessary that that be done.
	
	
	On 24 June, I was told by the Crown that the present trial could not start until today and that it was then that I was told that Mr Schaudin was attending upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain instructions. I then stood the matter over for mention today. Mr Schaudin was able to obtain the instructions which he sought from the accused yesterday, Thursday 25 June, and hence the applications made to me today.
	
	
	The present indictment contains one count. That count is this:
	


“On 31 December 2013 at Pennant Hills...while armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife did assault Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault he, the said Blake Weismantel, did inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.”


	
	The facts relied upon by the Crown are these, gleaned from exhibit T5. There is situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills a Thai restaurant. That restaurant is owned by Sathaporn Wongsamak, who is also the chef. There are nine employees including Mr Wongsamak’s wife, Laynookar Wongsamak, to whom I shall refer merely as Mrs Wongsamak. All nine members of the kitchen staff as well as Mr and Mrs Wongsamak were working on New Year’s Eve 2013. At around 10.30 pm, Mr Wongsamak was working in the kitchen and Mrs Wongsamak was working at the counter which is located to the right of the front entrance of the restaurant. Four customers were standing on the footpath outside the restaurant waiting for one of their friends who was still inside the restaurant using the bathroom. The four customers on the footpath had finished their meal and were waiting to be joined by their female friend. At about the same time, Mrs Wongsamak and her sister were sitting behind the front counter where the cash register was located.
	
	
	The accused walked in through the front door of the restaurant and approached the counter. He was holding a knife, 28 centimetres long, in his right hand. He was wearing a black coloured long sleeve woollen jacket with the hood covering his face. He was holding the hood down with his left hand. He was also wearing red, white and blue striped shorts. The accused reached over the counter and pointed the knife towards Mrs Wongsamak waving it around. The blade came very close to Mrs Wongsamak, almost touching her chest and abdomen. At that time the accused said nothing. He walked around the counter near to Mrs Wongsamak and her sister and started hitting the cash register with the knife yelling out, “Empty, empty!” As the accused was yelling he was looking at Mrs Wongsamak. She was shocked, scared and shaking. Mrs Wongsamak called out to her husband for aid. Mr Wongsamak and one of their daughters, and their nephew, and two staff members, ran from the kitchen of the restaurant.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak yelled out at the accused. He grabbed a wooden chair and held it towards the accused shouting, “Get out”. The accused turned around and walked towards Mr Wongsamak. He pointed the knife towards Mr Wongsamak again making stabbing motions. Mr Wongsamak used the chair to block the accused’s knife. The accused let go of his hood and grabbed another chair, pushing the chair and Mr Wongsamak back about a metre and a half, causing Mr Wongsamak to trip over and fall. He fell onto his left hand side, but in so doing twisted his right leg. Another staff member, Mr Borom, came out of the kitchen, picked up another chair and threw it at the accused. He then picked up a further chair and threw that at the accused. The accused then walked out of the restaurant, turning left, crossed the road, and started walking up Hillcrest Road towards Yarrara Road. A witness used his mobile telephone to take a photograph of the accused as he left. The accused’s red, white and blue striped board shorts can be seen in the photograph.
	
	
	Meanwhile Mr Wongsamak tried to stand up but could not do so because of pain in his right ankle. He remained laying on the floor. One of the customers who was outside the restaurant witnessed the event and called the emergency number. Police and ambulance officers arrived a short time later. A description of the accused was then broadcast. Unsuccessful attempts were made by a police dog to follow the accused. At approximately 10.35pm the accused was seen walking in a southerly direction along Pennant Hills Road, approximately 600 metres from the restaurant. The accused was asked to sit down, which he did. He was searched and police located a mobile phone, a black handled kitchen knife which was removed from the rear waistband of his shorts. The accused was trying to swing his arms around, and was behaving in what is alleged to have been an aggressive manner. At one point he became unconscious. The police called an ambulance. Whilst waiting for the ambulance to arrive the accused regained consciousness and over the next 40 minutes made rude comments to several police officers. On several occasions he moved around and two officers were required to restrain him.
	
	
	According to the police facts the accused remained moderately aggressive and was threatening, and did not respond to attempts to calm him down. At times he was incoherent. While Constable Brylynsky tried to hold the accused, the accused attempted to grab his hands on several occasions. The accused was alleged to yell words to the effect of, “Fuck you, you fucking dog, you like it when I grab you.” The accused was then placed under arrest. He was taken to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance under police escort. The accused also behaved aggressively to hospital staff. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where he was intubated and sedated to manage his aggressive behaviour. On New Year’s Day 2014 he was weaned from the sedation and he became more alert. He remained calm and was reviewed by the psychiatric team at the hospital, and he was re commenced on anti-psychotic medication. On 2 January 2014 he was medically stable, alert, oriented and calm. He was discharged by the hospital into police custody. He was taken to Hornsby police station and charged. He was offered an opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview but declined to do so.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak was conveyed to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance. He presented to the Emergency Department at 11.53pm. The history given by Mr Wongsamak to hospital staff was that whilst he was at work a man with a knife attempted to rob the business, and in the process of that occurring he twisted his ankle in the course of trying to evade the assault. On examination, the right ankle was swollen over the lateral malleolus and the patient was unable to the weight bear. X-rays demonstrated a spiral fracture of the fibula in the ankle. Mr Wongsamak was admitted to the hospital under the care of Dr Ben Gooden, an orthopaedic surgeon.
	
	
	There is before me, as well as a report from the doctor in the Emergency Department, a report from Dr Ben Gooden. He points out that the X-ray not only showed an oblique fracture of the distal fibula, but that oblique fracture extended to the level of the syndesmosis. The X-ray was said to show widening of the ankle mortise in keeping with instability of the ankle joint. Dr Gooden’s report continues thus:
	


“Mr Wongsamak was taken to theatre on 1 January 2014 and underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the fibula [sic] fracture with a seven hole one third tubular plate and screws. The syndesmosis was found to be unstable on stressing and he therefore had two diastasis screws inserted through the plate. He was kept non-weight bearing for a period of eight weeks post-operatively, and was then mobilised, weight bearing, following this. On 7 March 2014 he returned to the operating theatre to have the diastasis screws removed. This is a standard part of treating this type of fracture.

With regard to the questions that were asked of me from Senior Constable Steven Ireland on 7 July, this particular fracture is a reasonably common one. It does require significant force to lead to fracture of the fibula in association with disruption to the syndesmosis. The metal plate and screws were required to reduce the fracture into an anatomical position and this is standard treatment for this kind of displaced fracture. The patient underwent two procedures, the first being on 1 January 2014 to have the plate and screws inserted, and the second being on 7 March 2014 to have the two diastasis screws removed. It is usual to leave the remaining fibula metalwork in place, this is not routinely removed unless there are overt problems with the metalwork.

The prognosis for this gentleman is good. Most people who suffer these fractures will return to full activities as tolerated over the ensuing three-six months post-operatively. There is an incidence of patients who suffer from ongoing pain and swelling in their ankle after this and there is an incidence of the development of post traumatic arthritis in the long term. Post-operatively, patients require three-six months of physiotherapy to help regain their range of motion and full function of their ankle.”


	
	A statement taken from Mr Wongsamak on 14 September 2015 tells me that he still experiences constant numbness on the lateral malleolus. Prior to the fracture of his right ankle Mr Wongsamak exercised “quite a bit”, including walking on treadmills two or three times weekly. Since the fracture of his ankle Mr Wongsamak is unable to do that and develops pain and soreness in the ankle very quickly when he tries to walk for any long period of time. These ongoing symptoms have affected Mr Wongsamak’s ability to work. He is required, as a chef, to stand and he develops soreness and pain when he stands for long periods of time, which he never experienced before he fractured his ankle. He also notices symptoms when at rest. His ankle might start to ache when he is sitting down, which had never happened before the fracture of his ankle.
	
	
	That there might be post-traumatic arthritis indicates that there was damage to an intra-articular surface and as the ankle is a weight bearing joint it would appear that the onset of post-traumatic arthritis at some time in the future is inevitable. In any event, it appears that Mr Wongsamak has not made a complete recovery from this injury and it appears to me to be unlikely that he will do so, bearing in mind that symptoms have now persisted for some 17 months at least.
	
	
	The accused, by his counsel, tells me that there is no issue as to the identification of the accused at the crime scene. No alibi is raised. No positive defence is raised. In essence, the accused is putting the Crown to proof. That is understandable since the offence alleged against the accused carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. The accused wants a trial by judge alone. Although the original proceedings were listed for trial for six weeks, the first trial shortened after a week and two days. The Crown was unable to immediately start the second trial which is due to start next Monday.
	
	
	The personal circumstances of the accused must be carefully considered. There is before me a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, who examined the accused, in connection with other proceedings, on 1 December 2012. At that time the accused was 19 years old. He is now 24 years old. He is of Aboriginal descent who was exposed to domestic violence in his early childhood. His father was an alcoholic and his mother was addicted to heroin. His parents were separated when he was about eight years old. He remained in the care of his mother. He came to the attention of the Department of Community Services, as it was then called, about the age of seven. He was deemed to be at risk of physical harm, including sexual harm, because he was not adequately supervised by his parents. It was noted at that time that the accused was behaviourally disturbed. He commenced abusing alcohol at the age of 12 because he mixed with “the wrong crowd”. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in early childhood but was never treated with stimulant medication for that condition. In his childhood he suffered from mood swings and periods of anger. He also gave a history of depression and of psychotic symptoms that included hearing voices. When received into the Juvenile Justice System he was assessed as being psychotic. He was treated for both with antipsychotic medication and antidepressant medication. He was considered a risk to himself. He has been experiencing for some considerable time now hallucinations, auditory as well as visual. He also suffers from paranoia and as at 1 February 2012 had been having paranoid delusions for three years. He started abusing the sedative drug Valium at the age of 14 years and cannabis at the same time. He soonstarted using amphetamines and crystal methylamphetamine, or “ice”. By the age of 15 or 16 he was injecting heroin once or twice every fortnight. He also used Ecstasy at times, LSD and “Magic Mushrooms”.
	
	
	He was diagnosed by Dr Furst as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and substance abuse. Dr Furst also found evidence of personality dysfunction. Dr Furst said this about schizophrenia:
	


“Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, nerve instability and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness. There is often a prodromal period in which individuals with the illness feel lethargic, depressed and unable to cope, resulting in disruption to family relationships and poor social functioning. Frequent symptoms include paranoid beliefs, self-referential thinking, grandiose delusions and thought disorder.

Schizophrenia is thought to be biologically driven because of abnormalities in dopamine transmission, differences seen in brain volume and genetic transmission. It usually runs a chronic course requiring hospitalisation during acute episodes and the need for longer-term treatment with antipsychotic medications (tablets or injections), as have been required for Mr Weismantel in the past.”

As to the prognosis Dr Furst expressed the view that the accused was likely to continue to display psychotic symptoms of a residual type which was typical of the type of the illness from which he was suffering.


	
	An ambulance officer requested an assessment of the accused at the time that the accused was with the police immediately after his arrest on Pennant Hills Road. The ambulance officer who was authorised to exercise functions under the Mental Health Act 2007 informed an authorised medical officer of the Hornsby Hospital that the accused was mentally ill or mentally disturbed. He provided these details:
	


“Patient demonstrating psychotic behaviour. Patient unclear of situation. Patient making sexual advances to officers in response to assessment. Patient threatening violence towards officers and officers’ families. Patient agitated and fighting restraint. Patient not responding to questions or communicating appropriately.”

Hence the accused was conveyed to the Hornsby Hospital and admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007 prior to his being discharged from that institution and taken into police custody. It is clear that immediately after the offence now alleged the accused was suffering from psychotic symptoms. I have been told from the Bar table, without objection, that the accused remains on antipsychotic medication to the current time.


	
	If the matter be tried with a jury I am told that the Crown will need to call between 10 and 15 witnesses to give oral evidence, as well, no doubt, as Dr Gooden to give evidence to the jury about the extent of the injury sustained by Mr Wongsamak. I am told by Mr Schaudin from the Bar table, again without objection, that should the matter be tried by judge alone the trial can be conducted with most of the statements of witnesses, with suitable redaction, being tendered into evidence without any of those witnesses having to give sworn evidence from the witness box. In other words, there does not appear to be any issue of credit which might best be left to a jury. There is no factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards including any issue of reasonableness, any issue of negligence or any issue, for example, of indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. There is not, as here, any issue relating to intention that might best be determined by a jury as arose in R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 or any issue that raises any substantive issue of the credibility or reliability of any witness as arose in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661.
	
	
	However, there is the issue of the accused’s mental state and his ability to give attention to a lengthy trial. I sought some assurances from learned counsel for the accused and was given them. When I asked the learned Crown Prosecutor whether it was necessary for Mr Schaudin to call his solicitor to give oral evidence about those matters from the witness box, I was told that was not necessary.
	
	
	The early part of the first trial was taken up, as far as the accused was concerned, with concentrating on the issues raised in the first trial and giving attention to the six counts which he then faced. In essence, a count in the alternative was dropped by the Crown and the Crown did not proceed with the final count, the count of intentionally destroying Mr Brighton’s Nissan Pulsar motor car by means of a fire. The accused was prepared to plead guilty to charges carrying 25 years’ imprisonment, but was not prepared to plead guilty to a charge which carried a maximum term of 11 years’ imprisonment. Mr Schaudin assures me that because of the accused’s mental condition, he concentrated only on the issues relating to the first trial and did not raise with the accused any issues relating to the second trial until, in essence, the first trial was disposed of. It was then that the accused gave his counsel instructions to apply for trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	I have now seen Mr Weismantel in the dock for the whole of Monday, 22 June, and the afternoon of 23 June. I have seen him again in the dock this morning. At about 11.30 he asked to be excused from being in the dock, he preferred to be downstairs in a cell. He could not be taken from the Courthouse prior to the usual closing hour of 4pm in any event. Today he appears not attired for a trial, but in prison greens and he looked somewhat dishevelled, although he had not looked dishevelled last Monday. From what I was told from the Bar table, he appeared to be somewhat fatalistic about what might happen to him and oblivious to how he ought to be dressed when appearing before the Court. I am confident that a lengthy trial involving the calling of 10 to 15 witnesses would be very taxing on Mr Weismantel’s ability to concentrate, and I am concerned that he might not present towards a jury favourably after a number of days of hearing.
	
	
	One can understand the accused putting the Crown to proof of the matters contained in the second indictment because one might readily accept that, bearing in mind what was observed by police and ambulance officers immediately after the crime alleged in the current indictment, that he might not have any independent recollection of what he had done and therefore he puts the Crown to proof.
	
	
	When I enquired of the learned Crown prosecutor what would be achieved by a trial by jury, as distinct from a trial by Judge alone, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that the question of whether the harm inflicted upon the victim, Mr Wongsamak, was grievous bodily harm, distinct from actual bodily harm, was quintessentially a matter for a jury. I have only had in 11 years, one jury trial where such an issue was left to a jury as the sole issue in the case. There was a fracture of a bone, but no residual symptomatology. Quite frankly, I have been dealing with medico-legal issues as a Judge now for 21 years next month and am acutely aware of what might constitute grievous bodily harm as distinct from actual bodily harm and I have no hesitation in believing that a judge with some experience in the field can adequately determine that matter as well as any jury can or ought or would.
	
	
	The purpose of s 132A is to prevent the practice known as “forum shopping”. Not only is it to prevent that practice, it is to prevent the appearance of that practice. When I asked the learned Crown prosecutor whether it would be appropriate, to avoid the appearance of forum shopping, if I made the decision that the matter be tried by Judge alone, that it be heard by another Judge, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that if I made such an order there would be no application by the Crown that someone other than me should hear the Judge alone trial. In other words, the Crown accepts that this is not an actual exercise in “forum shopping”. The only ruling I have made thus far was against the accused, when I determined that coincidence evidence should be admitted in the first trial.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the difficulties which I accept that the defence has had in obtaining instructions from the accused, I accept that it was imprudent to seek instructions from the accused to have a trial by judge alone in the second trial, whilst the issues concerning the first trial were still extant. In the circumstances, I believe that I should exercise my discretion under s 132A(1) and grant leave to the accused to make an application for an order under s 132 less than 28 days before the date fixed for hearing.
	
	
	That issue raised a nice point as to whether the time for making the application ran from the date when the first trial was set to commence or ran backwards from the date when the second trial should have commenced had the first trial proceeded. However, that I need not decide.
	
	
	The issue then becomes whether it be in the interests of justice that the current matter be heard by a Judge sitting alone. I have carefully read what fell from the McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 and also what fell from Hidden J, particularly at [118] and also the decision of Bellew J in R v King and the decision of Latham J in R v Dean. It is clear that the fact that an accused has made an application for trial by judge alone is relevant, but not determinative. It is also clear on the case law that there is no presumption that trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on the accused. The accused carries an evidentiary onus but the Court does not need to determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a “presumption” of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and accordingly, depending on all the circumstances relating to a particular case, the Court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	There is no compelling reason in the current matter for trial by jury. There is a compelling reason, based on the accused’s mental health, that the trial be short. Accordingly, I believe it is in the interests of justice, not merely because of the interests of the accused personally, but because it is in the interest of our community that persons with a mental illness have a form of trial that meets the requirements of their medical condition, that meets the requirements of their ability to concentrate, and for a person such as the present accused, who may not recollect why or in what circumstances or how the offence was committed, that there be a reasoned explanation of why he might be guilty of the criminal offence, or, indeed, why he might not be guilty of the offence alleged against him. I have formed the view that it certainly is in the interests of justice that there be trial by Judge alone. I so order.

 Introduction 
The appellant was charged with the following offence: 
 
You, Ye Wei Gen, M/31 yrs NRIC: S2666144-G are charged that you on 16 April 1998, at or about 4pm, at Keppel Club, Bukit Chermin, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of Tan Ann Nie, F/21 yrs, by intruding into her privacy, to wit, by peeping in the cubicle when she was bathing, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted of the offence and fined $2,000 in default four weeks` imprisonment. The appellant has since paid the fine and has appealed against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted of an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code which reads: 
 
Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with a fine, or with both.
 
 
 
In making out its case against the appellant, the prosecution relied primarily on the evidence of the victim.
The victim testified that on the afternoon of 16 April 1998, she had gone swimming at Keppel Club (`the club`) with her boyfriend. After their swim at around 4pm, they both headed to the male and female bathrooms to wash up. These were located in the swimming pool complex of the club.
After placing her belongings in the locker, the victim entered one of the shower cubicles and began showering. The shower cubicle had an opaque curtain for privacy which the victim drew across the entrance to the cubicle. She initially had her back to the curtain when she turned on the shower, but, upon turning around, she saw the appellant looking at her through a gap between the curtain and the wall of the cubicle. She was completely naked at the time. The victim, despite being shocked and traumatised, shouted at the appellant. However, he continued staring at her for a few more seconds before leaving the female bathroom.
The victim gave evidence that the bathroom was lit and the distance between her and the appellant was less than one metre. She emphasised that, after she shouted at him, he continued staring at her for a few more seconds. The victim identified the appellant as the offender in the court below and gave a description of the offender that largely matched that of the appellant. More specifically, the victim said that she remembered his eyes, that he was fair-skinned and had slightly protruding teeth. Additionally, the victim reiterated her conviction that the appellant was the offender who peeped at her as `the look of him left a deep impression on me`. On top of everything, the appellant and the offender were both wearing a white shirt at the material time. The victim disagreed with defence counsel that she could not positively identify the appellant as the offender because it was too dark in the female bathroom and she added that her head was not under the shower of water at that time.
After the incident, the victim put on her clothes and went out to call her boyfriend. While they were standing in the area outside the male and female bathrooms discussing the matter, the appellant, his colleague and his boss walked past. The victim pointed out the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend but did not confront the appellant then because she was afraid that the appellant might turn violent. The victim`s boyfriend checked with the appellant`s boss whether they were from the management of the club but got a negative response. The parties went their separate ways.
The couple then headed to the security counter by the poolside to report the incident. The management of the club called back the appellant, his boss and his colleague who by then were about to leave the club. The victim`s boyfriend confronted the appellant and accused him of being the peeping Tom which the appellant vehemently denied. The victim testified that she consistently identified the appellant as the offender when the parties met at the security counter. The management took down the appellant`s particulars and he left the club.
The evidence of the victim`s boyfriend was generally in line with the victim`s testimony. He added that, despite feeling shocked and angry, he had not confronted the appellant the first time that the couple encountered him as it would be more prudent to report the matter to management first. Furthermore, he did not have much of a chance to stop the appellant, even though he had directed his enquiry about whether the group was from the management of the club to all three of them. He also said that the victim had pointed out the appellant to him twice after the incident.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The defence was a straightforward denial that the appellant had been in the female bathroom at the material time and had thereby committed the offence. The appellant said that he had gone to the club at about 3pm with his boss, Mr Lum Chong Chuen (DW2), and a female colleague, Rahimah, to conduct an inspection relating to the mechanical and electrical services for a club project. Rahimah was supposed to check the female bathroom and he was supposed to check the male bathroom.
The appellant`s account of his movements at the material time was as follows. Some time past 3pm, he went into the male bathroom to check the water tank. He took about ten minutes to do so. He then went back to the lobby, which was near the swimming pool complex, to discuss the project with Rahimah. After that, he went back inside the male bathroom to carry out another check. This whole procedure took an additional 10 to 15 minutes and the appellant was alone throughout this time. After completing his work, the appellant went to the cafeteria. He saw Rahimah sitting in the lobby and decided to buy two cans of Coke. He offered one of them to her but she declined it. They talked about the project for a further ten minutes. DW2 then showed up and there was a further discussion between him and the appellant regarding the work to be done for another ten minutes.
On the way to the pump room, the three of them encountered the victim and her boyfriend. The appellant`s version of events from then on was the same as that of the victim and her boyfriend`s accounts. The appellant said that he consistently protested his innocence when finally confronted by the victim`s boyfriend at the security counter. He willingly gave his particulars and denied having ever entered the female bathroom. His evidence remained unchanged under cross-examination.
DW2 testified that he had arrived at the club with his two employees. Upon arrival he went to the management office to join in a separate inspection with the Fire Safety Bureau. After completing this task, he went to look for the appellant and Rahimah and found the appellant in the video games room. The two of them went to the cafeteria and waited for about 10 to 15 minutes for Rahimah. The rest of his testimony did not vary from that of the victim, her boyfriend and the appellant.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge found that the only issue in this case was whether the victim had misidentified the appellant as the peeping Tom. Applying the 
 Turnbull 
 guidelines, as synthesised into a three stage test in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
 , the district judge held that the victim`s identification of the appellant as the offender was reliable. She came to this conclusion for four reasons: 
(a) although the female toilet was not brightly lit, there was enough light to enable the victim to see the facial features of the offender; 
(b) the distance between the victim and the offender was very short, only about one metre apart; 
(c) the victim gave evidence that the offender stared at her; it was not a fleeting glance at her; 
(d) after she shouted at the offender he continued staring at her.
The district judge added that this was the first time the victim had encountered such an experience and she was thus unlikely to forget the offender`s face.
With regard to the victim`s failure to confront the appellant when he walked past the couple along with his colleagues, the district judge accepted her explanation that she was afraid that the appellant might turn violent. The district judge noted however that the victim pointed out the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend. She also accepted the boyfriend`s explanation for not accusing the appellant directly before he clarified whether the group was from the management of the club. Further, the district judge was of the opinion that the victim`s reasons for identifying the appellant as the peeping Tom while at the Security Counter were sound.
As the only issue here was that of identification, the district judge, applying the dicta in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 , said that the heart of the case centred on the victim`s testimony and not whether there was corroborative evidence.
Finally, the district judge noted that there was a discrepancy between the appellant`s and DW2`s evidence in relation to whether the appellant was alone or with Rahimah when DW2 met him. The appellant said that he was in the lobby with Rahimah whereas DW2 said that the appellant was alone in the Video Games Room at the material time. The district judge was of the opinion that this was a material discrepancy and concluded that the appellant must have misrepresented the truth about the fact that he was with Rahimah in the lobby at the time the offence took place. She therefore found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant contended that the district judge had erred in law in finding that the victim`s identification evidence was of good quality within the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 and 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
. Furthermore, as the evidence against the appellant rested essentially on the testimony of the victim, he submitted that independent corroborative evidence regarding the offence should have been required. Finally, the appellant asked this court to overturn the district judge`s finding of fact. He contended that the appeal should be allowed as the lighting in the Female bathroom was not sufficiently bright, the victim did not accuse the appellant directly the first time she saw him after the incident, the so-called material discrepancy between the evidence of the appellant and DW2 in fact corroborated the appellant`s version of events, and the district judge had failed to properly consider the appellant`s evidence regarding his whereabouts at the time of the offence.
 The law on identification evidence 
 
 
 
The guidelines in 
 R v Turnbull 
 were recently reworked by the Court of Criminal Appeal for use in a non-jury system. In 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
, Karthigesu JA said the following at pp 475-476: 
 
In adapting the 
 Turnbull
 guidelines for our local system, we have reworked the 
 Turnbull
 guidelines into the following three step test. The first question which a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case where there is identification evidence, is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the defence to be mistaken.
 
 
 
If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made? A non-exhaustive list of factors which could be considered include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness had seen the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. In considering the circumstances in which the identification was made, the judge should take note of any specific weaknesses in the identification evidence. If after evaluation of the identification evidence, the judge is satisfied that the quality of the identification is good, he may then go on to safely assess the value of the identification evidence.
 
 
 
Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should go on to ask the third question. Is there any other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification. If the judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification evidence, he should then be mindful that a conviction which relies on such poor identification would be unsafe. The supporting evidence need not be corroborative evidence of the kind required in 
R v Baskerville
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
. What the supporting evidence has to be is evidence that makes the judge sure that there was no mistake in the identification.
 
 
 
The learned Judge of Appeal went on to echo Lord Widgery`s dictum in 
 R v Turnbull 
 that odd coincidences can, if unexplained, be supporting evidence.
In 
PP v L (a minor)
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 219
 , I affirmed the correctness of the test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
. I also pointed out in that case that while all victims of crime naturally feel stress and shock, it is precisely the fact that they have been molested or otherwise that would cause them to take a really good look at the offender and commit his face to memory.
 The victim`s identification evidence 
 
 
 
I now move on to the victim`s identification evidence. The victim testified that, just as she was about to begin showering, she turned round and saw the appellant`s face looking at her. After she shouted at him, he nevertheless continued staring at her for a few more seconds before leaving. The shower cubicle was lit at the time and the distance between them was less than one metre. The victim also gave a description of the offender, citing features like his eyes, teeth and fairness of his skin in her identification evidence. It was not disputed that these features matched those of the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant accepted that the three step test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
 applied to this case. He submitted that the answer to the first of the questions as to whether the case against the appellant wholly depended on the correctness of the identification evidence was in the affirmative. However, he argued that the quality of the identification evidence was in this case not good, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the appellant was made. Therefore, the district judge should have considered the third question of. whether there was any other evidence which supported the correctness of the victim`s identification.
I came to the conclusion that the quality of the victim`s identification evidence was good. The district judge cited four reasons for arriving at this result. The appellant only attacked one of these, namely, her finding that there was sufficient light in the shower cubicle which enabled the victim to see the offender`s facial features. He pointed out that in the court below, the district judge herself commented on the lack of bright lighting in the female bathroom and that the lit parts in the photographs came from the camera flash.
From the photographs tendered as evidence in the court below, it is clear that there were fluorescent lights in the female bathroom and above the shower cubicles. The district judge made it clear that, while she did not accept that the female bathroom was brightly lit, there was nonetheless enough light to enable the victim to see the appellant`s features clearly. What must further be noted was that counsel did not attack the other grounds cited by the district judge for finding that the quality of the identification evidence was good. At the risk of repetition, these were the proximity of the offender to the victim, the fact that he had looked at her face on and that she had had a good look at him for a few seconds. All of these factors fell squarely into the guidelines set out by Karthigesu JA which rendered the quality of the victim`s evidence very strong. Furthermore, as I emphasised in 
 PP v L (a minor) 
, the victim being on the receiving end of such a crime would have had the face of the offender emblazoned in her memory. The fact that she identified the appellant to the management of club within a short time of the incident taking place lent even more weight and credence to her identification evidence.
At any rate, the district judge had made a finding of fact that the victim had correctly identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence. It is trite law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn the trial judge`s finding of fact unless it can be shown that his decision was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence before him: 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , 
Ng Kwee Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 205
 , 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
  and 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
 . These cases thus stand for the principle that findings of fact by the trial judge are prima facie correct unless there are very good grounds for disturbing them.
Seeing as the district judge had applied her mind very carefully to the question of lighting and had, after considering all the evidence before her, reached the conclusion that there was enough light for the victim to recognise the features of the peeping Tom, counsel for the appellant did not have an easy task and indeed failed in his attempt to overturn this finding.
The answer to the second question in the guidelines must therefore be `yes`. Applying the three step test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
, there was no need to consider the presence of other supporting evidence for PW1`s identification evidence since the quality of the identification evidence was good.
 The need for corroborative evidence 
 
 
 
Counsel argued that an earlier decision of mine, 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
, made supporting evidence a necessary feature in this case as it involved a sexual offence.
The short and simple answer to this issue is this. I made it clear in 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
 that, where no one can sensibly say that no sexual offence has occurred, no corroboration warning need be given. Where the only live issue before the court is identification, a direction following the guidelines in 
 R v Turnbull 
 would suffice. Hence, there was no need in the present situation for corroborative evidence as long as the guidelines set out in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
 have been followed.
 Whether the district judge erred in disbelieving the appellant`s version of events 
 
 
 
I now turn to the final issue in the appeal. Counsel for the appellant contended that the district judge erred in finding that there was a material discrepancy between the evidence of the appellant and DW2 with regard to when and how they met each other after the appellant had completed his work. His main ground of complaint was that the district judge totally ignored DW2`s evidence that, when he saw the appellant, the appellant was holding two cans of Coke and that, when DW2 asked the appellant where Rahimah was, the appellant informed him that she had gone to do some other checking. The fact that the appellant was holding two cans of Coke in fact corroborated the appellant`s evidence that he had bought two cans, one for Rahimah and the other for himself, and showed that there was no material discrepancy between the testimonies of the appellant and DW2.
In my opinion, what counsel failed to appreciate was that the appellant gave evidence that, after checking the water tank, he went to the cafeteria and saw Rahimah sitting in the lobby. He bought two cans of Coke and offered her one which she declined. They discussed the project for ten minutes. He then saw DW2 coming towards them and spoke to him for a while more, 
 remaining 
 in the lobby for another ten minutes or so. This was in direct contradiction to DW2`s evidence that he found the appellant in the Video Games Room 
 alone 
. These two witnesses were supposed to have been recounting the same factual situation, yet it is clear as day that the stories diverge. In DW2`s evidence, Rahimah only joined him and the appellant 10 to 15 minutes after the appellant had come out of the Video Games Room and they had sat down in the lobby to discuss the project. There was no reason for DW2 to lie, being a witness for the defence and the appellant`s employer. As such, it is evident that the district judge did not err in disbelieving the appellant`s version of events and rejecting his defence that he was not in the female bathroom at the material time.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that the district judge failed to consider the surrounding factual circumstances that would have led her to conclude that the appellant`s behaviour was consistent with that of an innocent man. The more relevant items include the fact that, when DW2 wanted to do some further checking and walked in the direction of the toilets, the appellant willingly went along. Upon seeing the couple, he did not run away and instead carried on walking to the pump room. There was no attempt by the appellant to run away when he was asked to return to the club by Management. He had maintained his innocence when confronted at the lobby and in fact wanted the management of the club not to let the couple go for falsely accusing him. In addition. he willingly gave his particulars to the Management when asked to do so.
Furthermore, the appellant submitted that the victim despite having two occasions to identify the appellant as the peeping Tom, failed to do so. She never pointed him out even when she was at the security counter. This behaviour showed that the victim herself was not sure whether the appellant was the offender.
I have already considered the principles relating to an appeal against a trial judge`s finding of fact. In this case, the factors cited by the appellant that he claimed were not taken into account by the district judge were not crucial to her finding of fact that the appellant was guilty of peeping at the victim. His behaviour neither proved nor disproved his innocence. The district judge clearly believed the identification evidence of the victim and took into account the material discrepancy between the appellant`s and DW2`s evidence of whether the appellant was alone or with Rahimah when DW2 met him. It was also fallacious for the appellant to say that the victim never pointed him out as the offender. It was both her and her boyfriend`s testimonies that she had identified the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend. This clearly had to be so as the management would otherwise have had no reason to stop the appellant and his colleagues from leaving the club. All the above evidence formed the basis of the district judge`s decision that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offence under s 509. As the appellant has not shown that her decision was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, there was no reason to overturn her findings of fact.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the premises, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the appellant`s conviction and sentence.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Grove J. I also agree with the additional observations of Sperling J. There is a clear distinction between counts 1-5 and counts 6-13 both in terms of the issues at the trial and in terms of the length of delay. In the circumstances, a Longman warning was required only with respect to the earlier counts. (See R v Dixon [2001] NSWCCA 39, especially at [78] and R v Green [2001] SASC 25 at [32]-[43] ). 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: The appellant was tried at Sydney District Court before her Honour Judge Morgan and a jury upon an indictment charging thirteen counts of a variety of sexual offences committed between 1987 and 1994. The trial extended over five to six weeks between May and June 2000. The appellant was convicted on all counts and the structure of sentences imposed resulted in a non parole period being specified which established 19 October 2007 as the earliest date for parole eligibility. The appellant conducted the trial on his own behalf but he has been legally represented in this appeal. 
      
       
     3 The appellant was born on 24 July 1945. All offences involve the same victim who was one of twin sisters born on 7 June 1974 in Fiji where the appellant and his wife then resided. When the twins were very young they were adopted by the appellant and his wife and moved from an orphanage and thereafter lived in a home in Fiji. The family came to live in Australia in about 1980, the first place of significant residence being at Emerald in Queensland. At that time the family consisted of the parents, the twin girls and a natural born son. Later, two more sons were born.  
      
       
     4 The complainant gave evidence that her first recollection of anything of a sexual nature occurring between the appellant and herself was in Emerald when she was aged under eleven years. Emerald is, of course, outside of New South Wales jurisdiction. The family moved to this State in about 1987 and the first count charged relates to an event shortly after arrival when the family were resident in a caravan park near Botany Bay. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all of the sexual acts. The fifth count alleged an act of penile/vaginal intercourse taking place on the complainant’s sixteenth birthday (on 7 June 1990). The sixth count alleged a similar act in early 1992 when the appellant conveyed her home from a TAFE where some administrative matters had been attended to and when no one was at home upon their arrival. The final (thirteenth) count again charged a similar act in late 1994. At that time the complainant was in employment and preparing to leave the family home and live independently. It is acknowledged that there is dispute about some of the dates but contradictions can be referenced if necessary when dealing with relevant issues. 
      
       
     5 A written submission on behalf of the appellant acknowledged that the evidence of the complainant, if accepted, justified the findings of the jury on each count. At trial the appellant cross examined the complainant over some ten days. The transcript of his cross examination exceeds 500 pages. The appellant did not give evidence. His questioning revealed that he was not disputing the acts charged in counts six to thirteen but was contending that they took place in circumstances wherein the complainant was a consenting party. This was confirmed in his transcribed final address at trial. 
      
       
     6 The grounds of appeal were expressed in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The verdict of the jury in relation to each count of the indictment should be quashed on the grounds set out hereunder. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The Appellant was without legal representation at his trial. 
         
        
        
         
         3. It was beyond the capacity of the Appellant to conduct a trial of this complexity bearing in mind the peculiar features of cases involving sexual assault. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The Appellant was in such poor health throughout the course of the trial that he was physically and mentally unable to make decisions relating to the conduct of the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The Trial Judge erred in not staying the trial until legal representation was available to the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The Appellant was originally indicted on 13 counts relating to (the complainant’s twin) and there is confusion about the way in which the Crown substituted 13 counts relating to (the complainant). 
         
        
        
         
         7. Due to his poor health and inexperience the Appellant was unable to make a reasoned decision whether he should give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         8. Due to his poor health and inexperience the Appellant was unable to make a reasoned decision whether he should call evidence in the Defence Case. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The Trial Judge erred in her direction to the jury in relation to evidence of complaint. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give directions to the jury in relation to corroboration. 
         
        
        
         
         11. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to character. 
         
        
        
         
         12. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to his failure to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to his failure to call evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         14. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
        
         
         15. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give proper weight to the evidence of the character of the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         16. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give proper weight to the evidence of remorse and contrition. 
         
        
       
     7 Several of the grounds were obviously associated and it will be appropriate to deal with them together but first there should be a recording of some procedural matters touching upon the hearing of the appeal and in respect of which the Court sought, and received, submissions on a discrete issue. It has been observed that one possibility of the outcome of argument on the issue to which I now turn was that a new trial on all counts might need to be ordered. After deliberation, the Court determined to reconvene and hear further argument particularly on the balance of the grounds. 
      
       
        
       The Absence of a Longman Direction 
        
       
     8 The appeal was listed for hearing on Thursday 16 August 2001. On the preceding Thursday 9 August, the High Court handed down its judgment in Doggett v The Queen 2001 75 ALJR 1290. The apparent potential applicability of that authority to the present matter persuaded the Court to seek submissions from the parties in that regard. Both counsel for the Crown and for the appellant were given leave to supplement their oral submissions in writing and, in due course, these were provided.  
      
       
     9 The Court in Doggett divided, the majority being constituted by Gaudron and Callinan JJ who published a joint judgment and Kirby J. Gleeson CJ and McHugh J dissented. The issue was whether the trial judge should be held to have erred in not giving the jury what has come to be called a Longman direction: Longman v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 79. 
      
       
     10 As Gleeson CJ, in dissent, commented, it is not particularly enlightening to use the expression “a Longman warning” unless accompanied by an explanation of the terms of the warning. Kirby J observed that there were differences in the reasoning in Longman as to precisely why a warning was necessary notwithstanding statutory relief from the obligation formerly required by common law but he noted a common element in the judgments in that case recognizing the serious forensic disadvantages suffered by an accused person meeting, for the first time, accusations made long after the subject offences were alleged to have occurred. Analysis has shown that Longman does not identify clearly when a warning is mandatory save by reference to the loss by an accused of means of testing a complainant’s testimony which may not have been apparent to the jury: R v GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493. 
      
       
     11 In their joint judgment in Longman, Brennan, Toohey and Dawson JJ had said (@ p91): 
      
       
        
         
         “The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient.” 
          
         
        
       
     12 Doggett makes it clear that the presence of the word “alone” in that passage should not be taken to mean that the mere existence of corroborative evidence extinguishes the requirement for a Longman direction. 
      
       
     13 The reasoning and application to the then instant case was elaborated in the joint judgment in Doggett (@ p 1297): 
      
       
        
         
         “[46] In our opinion, the corroborative evidence which was led here did not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to give a  
         Longman 
          direction for the following reasons. 
          
          
         [47] First, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the circumstances surrounding the first three counts made the point that the complainant’s recollection of some matters was, to say the least, questionable. 
          
          
         [48] Secondly, the suggested explanation for the complainant’s assertions as to the approximate times of the first two offences is not one, with respect, which strikes us as very likely. It was not suggested as an explanation by the trial judge in his summing up on these counts. If it had been, there and then it would probably have drawn attention to the need for a direction of the very kind for which  
         Longman 
          stands. 
          
          
         [49] Thirdly, there was evidence from an apparently independent source, Ms A, categorically denying sworn evidence by the complainant that she had told Ms A some years before that she had been sexually touched by the appellant. 
          
          
         [50] Fourthly, and inevitably, the respondent was obliged to some extent to shift the basis of the prosecution when the discrepancy as to dates with respect to the first two counts, and consequentially if less significantly, to the third, emerged. 
          
          
         [51] Fifthly, the problems with which  
         Longman 
          is intended to deal are not confined to difficulties of recollection that the passage of time might cause for an accused. Of equal, and in some cases of which this might be one, or more importance is the denial by the effluxion of time, to an accused of the forensic weapons that a timely complaint might allow an accused to assemble, such as evidence as to where he was or what he was doing, or what other potential witnesses were doing when the offences were alleged to have occurred. 
          
          
         [52] This is made clear by the joint judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) in  
         Crampton v The Queen 
          (2000) 75 ALJR 133: 
          
          
           
           ‘The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. Her Honour should not have offered the qualification that she did in relation to the remarks she did make about the delay. An accused’s defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. Almost all of the passage of the majority in  
           Longman 
            to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence), should have been put to the jury.’ 
            
           
          
         [53] Sixthly, as we have already indicated, the corroboration was capable of establishing some undefined sexual molestation, probably improper, but not necessarily criminal in the respects alleged in the counts, and therefore not of such a nature as to relieve the trial judge of a duty to direct the jury in terms of  
         Longman 
          as explained in the passage from  
         Crampton 
          set out above. 
          
          
         [54] Seventhly, the approach of the Court of Appeal involved to some extent an inversion of reasoning. The correct approach in our opinion was to examine the evidence relevant to the particular matters with which  
         Longman 
          deals to ascertain whether the case called for a  
         Longman 
          direction, and not to make a broad assessment of the evidence overall (including the corroborative evidence), and to decide at that point, that the corroboration rendered a  
         Longman 
          direction unnecessary. That exercise should more appropriately be carried out in the overall assessment of the case, if and after error has been established, to enable the Court to decide whether the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and whether the proviso should be applied.” 
          
         
        
       
     14 In the course of her charge to the jury in the present matter the learned trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I should also point out to you that there has been a delay between the time when these events were alleged to have occurred, as she has said, back in Emerald and then when she was in this eight or nine year old period and then continuing on right up until just before she left home. But taking those earlier matters back in 1987 and earlier and, as I say, if you accept they took place in Emerald, that the accused may well have been at some disadvantage because of the delay which it has taken for her to bring this to anyone’s attention. And it may be that at that time, if anything had been raised when she was a young girl either in Emerald or in the early days here in Sydney, that it may well be that the accused might have been able to produce some evidence to suggest, well I wasn’t home at that time, he used to go away from Emerald on his business, or it would be an impossibility for something to have happened at that time. Well that is a matter entirely for you, whether you consider he was disadvantaged but that is certainly a matter which you should consider when you are looking at the Crown case.” 
          
         
        
       
     15 In written submissions (prepared before delivery of judgment in Doggett) the Crown Prosecutor contended that Longman would have no application because there was evidence in the case which could be regarded as corroborative. In particular reference was made to the evidence of the appellant’s brother and his sister in law. Whilst the capacity of the content of the evidence of the latter to amount to corroboration may be in dispute there is no reason to withhold that classification from the confessional material testified to by the appellant’s brother.  
      
       
     16 However, it was conceded by the Crown Prosecutor that that argument as expressed could not succeed in the light of the majority judgments in Doggett. It was further conceded that the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury did not contain directions which would comply with the requirements of Longman if that authority were held to be applicable. The passage of the charge to the jury which I have reproduced would seem the logical place for such a direction and it can be seen that none there appears. The absence is not a criticism of the trial judge who did not have the benefit of the authority and guidance available from Doggett.  
      
       
     17 The question for this Court is what effect the authority of Doggett should have on the conduct and outcome of the trial. 
      
       
     18 There was evidence presented by the Crown going back many years, indeed evidence about occurrences in Emerald whilst not chargeable by reason of jurisdictional limits was tendered in order to inculpate the appellant. Not only the complainant’s evidence but that of the appellant’s sister in law had focussed upon matters in the distant past when the family were resident in Queensland. 
      
       
     19 Following the hearing on the preliminary (Doggett) issue, solicitors for the appellant filed an affidavit sworn by the appellant’s wife (TJK). No leave to file or read such an affidavit was sought or given however, at the resumed hearing counsel indicated that in respect to the deponents of the significant number of affidavits by then accumulated cross examination was not sought on the basis of agreement that neither would seek to gain advantage from the absence of express challenge to an individual deponent if submission was to be made that any of the content of an affidavit should not be accepted or acted upon. 
      
       
     20 In accordance with leave granted, written submissions on the issue were forwarded on behalf of the appellant and on behalf of the Crown. The submissions on behalf of the appellant did not take the course encouraged by the Court of specifying the obstacles and handicaps pertinent to the appellant’s case in a fashion similar to the exercise undertaken in the joint judgment in Doggett where some seven reasons for the trial judge not being relieved of the obligation to give a Longman direction were scheduled. The bulk of the submission related to citation of selected passages from reported authority. It may have been helpful to analyse the circumstances evidenced at trial and therefrom seek to deduce obstacles to the appellant’s conduct of the case. In encouraging the course suggested it was not implied that the reasons in the appellant’s case should be identical to those in Doggett; some may have been comparable and there may be other and different reasons. However, a summary submission was advanced that because of delay in complaint it had been made “almost impossible for the appellant and his wife to try to track down real evidence, documentary evidence, council records, real estate agent’s records, school records, the church records, evidence of relatives, friends, neighbours, teachers and church members.”  
      
       
     21 The reasons for seeking such things were expressed as generalities and (compared to the bulk of submission) relatively briefly, viz: 
      
       
        
         
         “74. The question of objective evidence being available to identify just when it was that the K family lived at various places was of great importance. The Complainant had suggested that various events of significance occurred at particular times and at particular places. 
         
        
        
         
         75. The evidence of the Appellant’s wife TJK, in her affidavit sworn 22 August 2001 was filed to illustrate problems that faced the Appellant and his wife in obtaining evidence which might have been used to balance the evidence that had been given at trial by the Complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         76. There was even great importance in fixing when it was that the K family moved to Emerald in Queensland to live. 
         
        
        
         
         77. It was important to establish when various events occurred at their local Church. It was important to establish when it was that various friends and related inter acted with the K family. It was important that this evidence be very accurate to balance the evidence of the Complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         78. Turning to the affidavit of TJK: In paragraph 2 she gave evidence of the search by her and by the Appellant for records, photos, diaries, correspondence and potential witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         79. In paragraph 4 she gave evidence of the difficulties experienced in obtaining evidence relating to the period of time the K family spent in Emerald Queensland. 
         
        
        
         
         80. In paragraph 5 she gave evidence of the difficulties experienced in obtaining evidence relating to events in New South Wales. That period of time was of course most important because it included vital evidence relating to the circumstances surrounding various places where it alleged offences were committed by the Appellant.” 
         
        
       
     22 Express mention will be made of the content of some affidavits but the bulk emanates from family members (the appellant’s wife and sons) and is of little objective assistance. It is scarcely surprising that they would detect that the appellant appeared stressed as this would be expected of anybody facing trial on serious criminal charges. Nothing will be served by summarizing the affidavits, much of the descriptive content of which is couched in hyperbole. There are also demonstrable inaccuracies for example, TJK asserted that the judge told BKK that he could not take off his jacket in court and there followed a tale of leaving the jacket at home which was said to be “symptomatic of his stress and disorientation”. In fact BKK did complain of feeling the heat and her Honour responded “well see how you go, if you find that it’s unbearable, remove your coat”. (T125) All material will be weighed in the final analysis of whether the trial has been unfair and that comment applies equally to the affidavit material produced by the Crown. 
      
       
     23 Upon reconvening the Court specifically invited submissions on the issue of whether the appeal should be allowed on some counts and refused on some counts. The potential differentiation was between the more recent counts on the indictment for which the occurrence of the events was in issue. No submissions on this point were forthcoming from counsel for the appellant. Crown counsel submitted simply that such a course was open to the Court. 
      
       
     24 In my opinion such a course is open where there is an appellable error that affects one or some of the counts, but not the remainder of the counts. 
      
       
     25 There is a distinction to be drawn in the present case between the cogency of complaints of handicap where, on the one hand, the appellant denies sexual dealing with the complainant and on the other, dispute is limited to the proof of absence of consent to admitted sexual congress. 
      
       
     26 The Crown resisted the conclusion that the absence of a Longman direction should lead to a new trial. 
      
       
     27 First it was argued that in Doggett the majority apparently regarded the corroborative evidence as of inferior quality leaving open the possibility that in an appropriate case corroborative evidence may remove the need for a Longman direction. The sixth mentioned reason in the extract from the joint judgment is pertinent. Kirby J also remarked: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Gaudron J pointed out in  
         M v The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 487 ‘corroboration or lack thereof is only one of many considerations which bear on the evaluation of evidence’. Furthermore, where (as here) the corroboration is patchy, in some respects unspecific and in others completely silent on the incidents referred to in the charges, the mere fact that corroborative evidence of some kind exists will not entirely remove the utility, and the necessity, of a  
         Longman 
          warning.” 
          
         
        
       
     28 Whether there be some case where corroboration is so strong that warning is not required, the present case cannot be so classified. The evidence of conversation with the sister in law included ambiguities and oblique references to such things as “mandatory reporting of child abuse” (as an alleged Queensland state requirement). Whilst more pointed and including an admission by the appellant of having “sex”, the evidence of the appellant’s brother nevertheless included generalities such as assertions that he ignored “the rest because they were all rantings and ravings”. These remarks need to be qualified in relation to the thirteenth (final) count when, on the day following the alleged offence, the complainant’s condition was viewed and assessed by witnesses including medical experts who detected signs consistent with the allegation. Corroboration available in respect of that count was markedly stronger. 
      
       
     29 The object, of which sight must not be lost, is assistance to a jury particularly with respect to considerations of which they may not be aware and with which they may not be familiar. Determination of whether the jury has had appropriate assistance cannot be dependent upon an isolated assessment of the strength or otherwise of corroborative evidence, the weight to which a jury has concluded should be given, will be unknown.  
      
       
     30 The second aspect of the Crown argument involved an extensive and painstaking survey of matters relating to the distant past which the appellant was able to refer to in detail – it was described as minute detail - which was manifest particularly in his cross examination of witnesses including the complainant. 
      
       
     31 So impressive in its extent were these matters and associated documentation produced or under reference, that it was submitted that in the “perhaps unique” circumstances of the case the Court should hold that a Longman direction was not required. 
      
       
     32 The warning to the jury does not concern what an accused has in fact been able to produce. It is concerned with informing the jury and cautioning them about matters which may have handicapped that accused and as a consequence obstructed him from being able to elucidate circumstances or demonstrate facts which support his contentions. That is not to invite a jury to speculate upon what an accused may have been able to prove and expression of a Longman direction must be so designed as to avoid that error. 
      
       
     33 There is, however, a matter in relation to the appellant’s claims of handicap which is unusual. In the disturbingly large number of cases concerning sexual abuse which come before the courts, where there is dispute between an alleged offender and a child (at the time of offence) complainant, the issue is frequently whether sexual activity took place at all. This has previously been observed by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Crampton @ p141. Consent is of course irrelevant and provides no basis for defence in such cases. The sexual activity will usually be alleged to have occurred in secret and it is in seeking to support a denial of occurrence that the handicap encountered by an alleged offender has been perceived. Recognition of such matters does not imply any shift in the burden of proof. Longman for example was a case itself of denial by an accused who, when questioned by police (and at trial), described his dealings with the complainant as entirely innocent. It adds to difficulties faced in such circumstances that there would have been necessarily dealings between disputant parties, they very frequently having resided as members of a domestic unit. It is acknowledged that Doggett had some unusual features in allegations by the alleged offender of sexually precocious advances by the complainant, but in that case all offences charged involved conduct when she was aged under sixteen years. 
      
       
     34 The unusual matter to which I refer in relation to the appellant affects the sixth to thirteenth counts. Each of these counts charged sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The cross examination of the complainant showed that the appellant did not contest the occurrence of sexual congress but essentially claimed that she was a consenting party. 
      
       
     35 A synopsis of the basis of each count and the conduct by the appellant of his case at trial should be made.  
      
       
     36 Count six was located by reference to the complainant having left school at age sixteen, attended TAFE as an evening student for a year (1991) and making a decision to seek to repeat that year. Arrangements were made to see the College Head and the appellant accompanied the complainant on that visit. Afterwards when they returned home there was no one else in. Intercourse took place against the complainant’s wishes. Significantly the appellant put this question to her (T594): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I am therefore not denying that there was full vaginal penetration when you talked about coming back from the TAFE College. I am not denying that. I put it to you that that was the first time there was ever full vaginal penetration? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     37 Count seven was referenced by the complainant to a celebration of the eighteenth birthday of the twin girls which did not occur on the actual birthday but within one or two weeks thereof. The complainant gave evidence of a series of sexual acts performed on her by the appellant including sodomy, attempted fellatio, penile intercourse and cunnilingus. The appellant cross examined the complainant about a number of matters relating to the preparations for the party and the closeness of the relationship between them alleged to have been in existence at the time. I cannot identify questions asked by the appellant which concede specific sexual activity on this occasion but the following extract (T717) suggests that any denial is focussed upon the allegation of the combination of events rather than denial of sexual conduct. In this context the wide statutory definition of sexual intercourse is germane. The evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Thank you. Going back to the incident of your 18 birthday and referring to the evidence in chief at page 173, which you won’t have, line 30, the Crown asked: 
         
        
        
         
         ‘Q. What sort of a noise did you make?’ You replied ‘A. Like a, like a whimpering noise and he just told me to shut up or else I’ll wake my sister. I goes, No, well it hurts. And then, and I, and I rolled over and then he, he tried to put his penis in my mouth’. Remember that answer? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did I not yesterday ask a brief general question about the personal hygiene of yourself and myself and you gave positive answers in relation to that, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That we both have high standards of hygiene and personal cleanliness, remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well I reject emphatically, entirely and completely and I put this to you, this is completely and utterly wrong that I would ever go from penis to anus to penis in mouth to penis in vagina. I reject that and I put to you this is a blatant lie? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No it is not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also suggest to you the event never happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did.” 
         
        
       
     38 The eighth count was evidenced by a description by the complainant of an occasion whilst the appellant’s wife was away in the Blue Mountains and the three boys stayed at a friend’s house. The twin girls went to see a film with the appellant and on return he demanded that the complainant engage in sexual congress with him. She described the occurrence which included penile/vaginal intercourse. The appellant cross examined the complainant at length concerning the time of the year during which his wife went to a conference or seminar in the Blue Mountains. He also cross examined her about detail of the actual residential address at the time and the films which were showing in Sydney at the time.  
      
       
     39 The appellant produced a lease to support his contradiction of the accuracy of the complainant’s testimony concerning the date of this offence by demonstrating that the family was not in occupation of the premises specified at the time. However the cogency of that attack has been undermined by the content of the appellant’s wife’s recent affidavit which includes: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant identified a particular incident by reference to my attendance at a conference for teachers in the Blue Mountains. I know that the conference was at another place and another date, but despite diligent searching I cannot find a diary or other record that would provide verification.” 
         
        
       
     40 The challenges would need to be assessed in the light of the general posture of the appellant which did not deny the existence of a sexual relationship between the father and adopted daughter. A revealing exchange is recorded at T588-599: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Given the general description that you have given of your mother’s work and that you had your own single bedroom, I put it to you that is when the relationship between your father and yourself began to intensify. We are talking here around late 1991, 1992. What I mean by relationship, that is when you were first caressed in 1991 in the downstairs area of Halcyon Avenue. 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is garbage. That is a lie. You used to do it to me in Carrington Road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. We have heard that before. I also put to you the first time your father did caress you, he himself went into deep shock at what he had done? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. It is not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you that what stunned him the most was your positive reaction? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you that from then on in you did everything to encourage a sexual relationship? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also say to you that at Halcyon Avenue towards the end of 1991 there was already an occasion did occur where, late 1991, where you did, it did actually lead to ejaculation but not penetration, late 1991, because of the caressing and the messing about? 
         
        
        
         
         A. (No verbal response). 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Can you answer that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I did not realise it was a question. I thought he was stating something. I was waiting for him to ask me a question. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: Q. In late 1991 because of the caressing did it lead then eventually to ejaculation because we were both messing about on the bed, do you remember at that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it because that happened your father said ‘No (R), no, this is not for me to do this, is wrong. One day you will meet up with someone your own age and it is for that person to do’. That is what your father said? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. It is a lot of garbage. It never happened. I never said that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your reaction was, ‘No there is nothing wrong. What’s wrong about this’ and that then led to your comment, ‘What’s the difference between me and as if a strange woman walked into this place’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is garbage. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Later on I recall, I am putting to you later on in Alice Street in September/October 1994, I reminded you of this event and I said to you ‘(R) I used to always wonder about this so-called strange woman walking down the driveway’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Never said any such thing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you in September/October 1994 the reason why I said that to you is because in September and October 1994 I was saying to you again ‘The affair must end, we have got to go and get help’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Garbage. Outright lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you in September/October 1994 that the major topic of discussion between you and me was whether or not at law there was an incestuous relationship and I would face criminal prosecution because of it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. You never ever said that.” 
         
        
       
     41 The ninth count alleged an act of intercourse in bushland while returning from a journey to an airport during a family holiday at Bermagui. Again the descriptions by the complainant were of enforced acts including penile/vaginal intercourse. The appellant cross examined the complainant about a considerable amount of detail concerning the events at Bermagui, however there was a significant suggestion by him that there had been discussion between them that there would be a sexual encounter before return from the journey to the airport. Cross examination by the appellant included (T698): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. All right. I would suggest to you in relation to the answer that you gave that, going back to line 45 plus, ‘He ripped the L plates off the front of the Toyota and told me to get in the passenger side which’. I don’t know what the ‘which’ is for but that’s what you said. That’s partly correct but hides the real reason as to why that incident took place and I put it to you that we were actually running behind time. We knew we were going to get late into Bermagui and we already had discussed the fact that we were going – that there was going to be a sexual encounter before we got home. It had already been discussed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, that’s a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t.” 
         
        
        
         
         And: 
         
        
        
         
         “Q. I put to you this is what happened; as we were approaching the T intersection. I said to you ‘Look, Honey, it is getting late, we better go home’ which would mean then I would continue on to the T intersection, turn left and go home and you replied, ‘No it’s not too late, it’s all right, let’s go’ or words to that effect and you said ‘turn here’. Do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The reason why you said ‘turn here’ was because if you go there even today three is a little dirt track just prior to the T intersection where, if you turn left, it goes into what is generally known as the Bermagui National Park, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I remember an entry to the National Park but I don’t know about dirt. The dirt track is in the National Park. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Furthermore I said ‘are you sure’ and you replied explicitly, ‘yes, yes, I want to’, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Didn’t happen. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And it is not surprising, I put to you, that you said, ‘yes, yes, I want to’ because for the previous 10 minutes or half an hour you had been caressed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is an outright lie.” 
         
        
       
     42 The tenth count involved an allegation that forced intercourse had taken place at the complainant’s place of employment at Artarmon. Cross examination by the appellant did not involve a denial of sexual intercourse and in fact posited that it occurred “regularly” there. (T602): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Without conceding the date of the 26th of February 1994, I do agree that sexual intercourse did take place at Snap Artarmon on a fairly regular occasion and I also state that the act of sexual intercourse did take place on what is known as the trimming bench at Snap Artarmon. I do not deny that. I am not allowed to make a statement, so I put it to you that what I have just said is basically – you would agree with me I’m telling a truthful statement when I say that, that there was sexual intercourse between you and me regularly at Snap Artarmon? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know the question you are asking me. If are you asking me did it happen regularly or that it did happen on the trimming bench? 
          
          
         Q. It happened regularly. I think you have already said yes? 
          
          
         A. No, I didn’t understand when you meant regularly, like that’s the incident. I could remember when I made my statement and it did happen. 
          
          
         Q. Did it happen almost invariably each time your father went with yo to work overtime at Snap Artarmon? 
          
          
         A. Are you saying every time on the trimming bench did the sex act? 
          
          
         Q. Just the act of sexual intercourse, did it? 
          
          
         A. Like I said, they are the two times I could remember when I made my statement.” 
         
        
       
     43 The eleventh count was described by the complainant with reference to driving lessons which the appellant gave her during which they visited the Mt White area just near the old Pacific Highway. The complainant said there were many incidents between them on these driving lessons. The content of the appellant’s cross examination did not seem to involve denial, indeed at one point he put questions to the complainant suggesting she had said to him that she would move her position in the car “so Mum won’t suspect or guess what’s going on”. The appellant did not expressly concede the description of events by the complainant but, consistently with his assertion that there was a “relationship” between them, he asked questions such as (T666): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I also suggest that there are other paragraphs in your statement where the paragraphs scream consent? 
         
        
        
         
         A. (No verbal response). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes or no? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know the question you are asking. I thought that was a statement.” 
         
        
       
     44 The issue which the appellant appeared to be seeking to canvass was the precise location of the alleged misconduct which he referred to from time to time as “events”, for example, (T668): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I suggest to you that if the event took place it took place near pine trees on a divided road, you are quite correct. When you came out from underneath the pine trees you actually almost turned the car into on coming traffic and that is hence the panic. I grabbed the wheel, swung the car round and put it in the opposite direction for you.” 
         
        
       
     45 The twelfth count was identified as to time by reference to a mock wedding ceremony held by a youth group of which the complainant was a member and a red dress which she borrowed to wear on the occasion. It was on her return home that she described another sexual attack by the appellant. Cross examination by the appellant was directed towards detail in the complainant’s statement concerning a description of the complainant taking off her red dress and taking something from the bed to cover herself and flicking it away. The peripheral detail was put in issue by the appellant but not the act of intercourse. Some of his cross examination included (T768): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The Crown asked you on p 210 at the bottom line 57,58: ‘Did you take the dress off’? And you replied ‘Yes I did’. And the Crown, do you remember that answer? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Those when I came back yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the Crown went on further to say did something happen at that point and you said, yes, my father had come in and then there you continued to give well – I have got to go on with it. The Crown asked what happened when you came in and you replied: ‘He asked why did you take the dress off and I had grabbed something off the bed to cover myself’; do you remember? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. and he said how were you dressed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was just in my under pants. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And in fairness you grabbed something and then yo replied you tried to flick them away do you remember answering that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That is what I am puzzled about because the Crown asked what were you trying to flick away and you replied I grabbed something off of the bed and was holding it in front every myself and he was trying to flick whatever I was holding away. I cannot remember what it was. I put it to you you cannot remember because it never happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I put it to you the reason why you came home by 10pm that night, and that this event never happened is you wanted to make love with your red dress on? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie.” 
         
        
       
     46 The thirteenth count relates to an occurrence in October 1994 when the complainant had determined to leave the family home. In the evening there was some discussion between the appellant, his wife and the complainant. She said that later in the evening she was in her room when the appellant entered and told her to take her nightie off and intercourse took place in the complainant’s bed. The appellant did not deny this act of intercourse but cross examined the complainant at length about the details as to how it occurred. He referred to evidence that the complainant had given that she had been crying and put to her that he was caressing her and kissing her “before the sexual act began”. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I also say, on this entire story, that you left out completely, the details of the sexual act that actually, did take place even though those details are contained within your own statement. Would you look at your statement.” 
         
        
       
     47 In relation to this last count there was apparent reference to the occurrence in a later phone call which the appellant had with his brother (after he had been charged with offences) when he said, amongst other things “on the Thursday night I slapped her but she was very consenting with sex” (T973).  
      
       
     48 As already noted, the cross examination extended over many days but the above extracts suffice to demonstrate that, subject to dispute about the commencement date, details of the acts and consent, the appellant did not seek to join issue with the complainant that intercourse had taken place. He referred frequently to “relationship” and at times has mentioned the name of an American film producer whose then current marriage notoriously came to an end when he was discovered to be engaged in a sexual relationship with an adopted daughter of his wife. 
      
       
     49 Counts six to thirteen can be categorized differently from counts one to five for the purpose of assessing whether the appellant was disadvantaged by the absence of a Longman direction. No submission has been made by counsel now appearing which identifies any specific handicap visited upon the appellant in conducting his case on the issue of consent in relation to the latter counts which he contested. The details of the surrounding circumstances of the undenied intercourse, and critically whether consent was freely given, were on the case that the appellant was presenting within the exclusive knowledge of the participants. Insofar as the appellant sought to support his contentions by matters such as the appearance of the complainant, her continued participation in family and church group activity, the absence of overt distress and so forth, these were uninhibitedly and extensively canvassed by the appellant in his cross examination of the complainant.  
      
       
     50 It can be interpolated that, following the event giving rise to count thirteen, there was prompt complaint about it. The complainant testified that on the day following the offence she went to work and her employer made an enquiry about the appearance of her face. She replied in the negative but then spoke to a girlfriend whom she told that the appellant had hit her and raped her. This was on 28 October 1994. A Detective Frances Lynch came to the complainant’s place of work and saw her appearing upset and tearful. She was taken to the sexual assault clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital and seen by a social worker and a gynaecologist. Accompanied by a solicitor, the appellant attended upon Detectives Robertson and Lynch at Lane Cove Police Station on 13 December 1994 where he was charged. He was committed for trial in May 1995.  
      
       
     51 Counts one to four allege indecent assaults occurring respectively at Botany, Narrabeen, St Ives and Wahroonga between January 1987 and September 1989. The fifth count charges carnal knowledge of a daughter contrary to s73 of the Crimes Act on 7 June 1990 which was the complainant’s sixteenth birthday. Consent does not provide defence to a charge under that section if the victim is aged less than seventeen. The extracts of evidence set out above include the assertion by the appellant (T588) that the “first caressing” occurred in Halcyon Avenue in 1991 and it can be deduced that the appellant contends that the events described by the complainant in support of counts one to four did not happen and that no sexual intercourse took place on the complainant’s sixteenth birthday, and that no such intercourse took place until after she had attained her seventeenth birthday. 
      
       
     52 It is important however to consider that the Crown had also called a significant amount of “relationship” evidence going back to the complainant’s recollection of the earliest sexual dealing with her by the appellant in Emerald, Queensland in the mid 1980s. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all of this evidence but its content was clearly designed and capable of adding force to the Crown’s case of inculpation of the appellant.  
      
       
     53 There is an obvious difference between disadvantage that might be perceived in seeking to support a denial of misconduct in increasingly distant past which is said not to have happened at all and disadvantage in seeking to support an assertion of consent to relatively more recent occasions of undenied sexual congress. 
      
       
     54 Applying the principles elucidated in Doggett, I conclude that the absence of a Longman direction in relation to the former category leads to an assessment that the jury did not receive needed assistance in respect of considerations of which they may not be aware and with which they may not be familiar, however, the same assessment should not be made in relation to those counts which are in the latter category.  
      
       
     55 It was submitted by the Crown that the Court should, in the event of reaching the conclusion which I first mentioned dismiss the appeal by application of the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I do not consider that appropriate to the circumstances and I would reject the submission. 
      
       
     56 The consequence of those views is that the convictions and sentences on counts one to five should be quashed and I would order a new trial in respect of them but the Court should proceed to consider the other grounds of appeal particularly as they pertain to counts six to thirteen. 
      
       
        
       The Absence of Legal Representation at Trial 
       
     57 Grounds 2, 3 and 5 are associated and can be dealt with together. It is the fact that the appellant represented himself at trial, that is to say, the trial which eventually took place. In assessing the appellant’s complaints it is instructive to make some observations of the events leading up to it. In this context the observation of the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Mahoney JA) in Attorney General for New South Wales v Milat 1995 37 NSWLR 370 @ 374 can be borne in mind: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is nothing in  
         Dietrich 
          to suggest that an indigent accused can be frustrate attempts to bring the accused to trial simply by rejecting offers of legal aid or other assistance. Mason CJ and McHugh J emphasized that the circumstances of each case need to be considered, and Deane J related the principle in question to denial of legal representation by reason of an accused’s lack of means and the unavailability of other assistance”. 
         
        
       
     58 Following committal for trial the appellant was arraigned in September 1995 and after listings hearings a trial commenced in June 1996 at which the appellant was represented by senior counsel. On the appellant’s application (through counsel) the jury was discharged in order to enable certain handwritten notes from the appellant’s brother to be examined and for counsel to take instructions about them. Between 1996 and 1998 four further trial dates were fixed. The appellant sought vacation of the trial dates on the basis of the need to resolve disputes between himself and legal aid authorities. On one occasion (in 1998) he informed the Court that he had withdrawn the instructions of the solicitor to whom the matter had been assigned by the Legal Aid Commission. In 1999 the appellant applied for a stay of proceedings “until the matter of legal representation is resolved”. This was heard by Christie DCJ. The managing solicitor of the Legal Aid Commission gave evidence and during his testimony pointed out that the appellant had never lodged an appeal against any refusal to grant him legal aid. His Honour refused the stay. A few days later a solicitor appeared before his Honour on a pro bono basis and, inter alia, informed him that an appeal had been lodged against the refusal to stay proceedings.  
      
       
     59 This appeal came before the Court (differently constituted) on 3 February 2000 and judgment was given on 8 February when the appeal was, by majority, dismissed: R v BK 2000 NSWCCA 4. A scheduled trial date had been fixed for 14 February 2000. Sully J remarked: 
      
       
        
         
         ”Having regard to what has passed previously between the appellant and the Legal Aid Commission, as supplemented by the fairly exiguous additional material that was placed before the Court in connection with any fresh application by the appellant for legal aid, it seems to me to be an overwhelming inference that the appellant either will not be granted legal aid at all; or will be granted legal aid upon such terms as are unacceptable to him. There seems to be an irreconcilable difference of view between the appellant and the relevant officials of the Legal Aid Commission as to the justification for the briefing of Senior Counsel rather than junior counsel to represent the appellant at his trial. It is, in my opinion, reasonable to infer also that there are irreconcilable differences of opinion between the appellant and the relevant officials at the Legal Aid Commission as to the way in which, and the basis upon which, the appellant’s case at trial should proceed.” 
         
        
       
     60 Carruthers AJ observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “Reduced to its simplest terms the issue of legal representation for the appellant reached a stalemate some considerable time ago. The matter cannot be resolved by the grant of legal aid at the instance of the Legal Aid Commission for three reasons. The appellant’s financial position is such that he does not qualify as eligible for a grant of legal aid because of the Commission’s means test criteria. Secondly, even if the means test could be satisfied the Commission would only grant legal aid for junior counsel to represent the appellant. This has always been unacceptable to him. Thirdly, there is an insuperable difficulty because of ethical matters, the detail of which it is inappropriate to expand upon at this stage. Those ethical problems could be resolved by the appellant but the mode of resolution is unacceptable to him. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand the appellant is not in a financial position to afford the quality of private representation (experienced senior and junior counsel) which he wishes to retain. 
         
        
        
         
         The only proposal which senior counsel appearing for the appellant before this Court was able to submit for the resolution of this problem was for the trial to be delayed for at least a further 18 months or two years to enable the appellant to obtain the necessary funds to finance appropriate private representation. 
         
        
        
         
         Such a proposal is, however unsupportable. It is now almost five years since the appellant was committed for trial on these serious charges, some of which relate to the period when the complainant was a child. Such further proposed delay in the trial is unacceptable. Secondly, in the light of the evidence as a whole, no court could have any degree of confidence on the present evidence that the appellant would be in a financial position to afford the quality of legal representation of which he speaks at any foreseeable time in the future.” 
         
        
       
     61 Smart AJ, in dissent, would have ordered the vacation of the trial date. His Honour observed that cash apparently available to the appellant and his wife would be required to meet taxation liabilities and having noted that they were conducting a business he referred to a proposal by the appellant that a long delay be granted in order to enable him to earn money to pay for private representation. His Honour spoke in alternative terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “It would not be beyond the Court’s power to require the applicant to set aside weekly amounts to meet his costs. If the moneys held by the wife are paid to the Taxation Department that may enable a fresh application for legal aid to be made.” 
         
        
       
     62 Nothing has been put forward to indicate that the appellant ever sought to implement his Honour’s suggestions.  
      
       
     63 In fact the trial did not proceed on 14 February 2000. A motion was filed seeking to postpone the trial principally on the grounds of the appellant’s alleged medical condition. On various days in February and March the matter was before Horler A/DCJ, Howie DCJ (as his Honour then was), Blanch CJ/DC and Dalgleish A/DCJ.  
      
       
     64 A trial date of 3 April was vacated but on 29 March 2000 the Chief Judge commented that it appeared that the appellant was seeking to avoid trial and it eventually commenced before Morgan DCJ and a jury on 1 May 2000. 
      
       
     65 In written submissions on behalf of the appellant reference is made to Dietrich v The Queen 1992 177 CLR 292 and it was submitted that “the fundamental prescript of the criminal law of this country is that no person shall be convicted of a crime except after a fair trial according to law”. There can be no dissent from that proposition but the decision is not authority for the implied assertion in this case that a trial conducted by the accused without legal representation was inevitably unfair. 
      
       
     66 Unfairness of this trial was sought to be stated by seven points expressed thus: 
      
       
     · “He did not have legal representation, 
      
       
     · His health prevented him from making correct decisions during the trial, 
      
       
     · The jury did not have the benefit of evidence from the appellant, 
      
       
     · The jury did not have the benefit of evidence from other witnesses called to support the defence case, 
      
       
     · Errors were made by the trial judge. 
      
       
     · All of the factors combined to bring about a miscarriage of justice.” 
      
       
     67 The first merely states an uncontested fact. Her Honour gave express advice and the appellant’s right to give evidence was well known to him as was his entitlement to call witnesses, although who these witnesses would be and what relevant evidence they may have given has not been articulated. I shall in due course deal with the grounds asserting error on the part of the trial judge. Apart from the statement in the grounds no other errors by her Honour are sought to be identified. The appellant’s health is the subject of separate grounds but it is correct that it would be appropriate to consider any matters of health in conjunction with the absence of legal representation, however that is not to say that any impediment whatsoever to health has necessary nexus to absence of legal representation with the consequence that it must be concluded that the trial was unfair. 
      
       
     68 Reference was made to s402 of the Crimes Act 1900 (now s96 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1980) which provides that “an accused person is entitled to make full answer and defence by counsel”. The purpose of reference is unclear but the provision in its terms neither mandates that an accused be provided with counsel at public expense nor that particular counsel or counsel of particular rank must be supplied. 
      
       
     69 Article 14(3) (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is set out in written submissions. It reads: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality: 
         
        
        
         
         ….. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it.” 
         
        
       
     70 That covenant is not part of applicable domestic law in New South Wales and it gives rise to no particular right vested in the appellant. The issue is whether the trial which has been conducted was unfair and neither the existence of the covenant nor its provisions determines the answer to that question.  
      
       
     71 This appeal was previously listed on 9 May 2001 before a court differently constituted (Hodgson JA, James and Adams JJ) when reference was made to affidavits which had been prepared in connection with the appeal, some of which had not then been served. In the circumstances earlier stated they, and the further affidavit of the appellant’s wife have been put before the Court. 
      
       
     72 The relevant content of the affidavit of the appellant sworn 7 June 2001 is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. I had intended to give evidence at my trial and this continued to be my intention well into the period of presentation of the prosecution case. However when the prosecution case concluded and it was time to present my defence my mental and physical condition was such that I felt incapable of giving a reliable account of myself. Consequently I elected to present no case. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In outline my answer to the charges laid against me was to be as follows: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) That at no time did I have any sexual nor intimate conduct in relation to the complainant, otherwise than with her full approval. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) I did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant prior to her reaching the age when she was enabled to give her consent.” 
         
        
       
     73 In relation to that affidavit the Crown has submitted that, given the limited scope of that intended evidence, particularly the complete failure to explain how and in what circumstances the appellant would say that the consensual relationship with his adopted daughter commenced, that evidence would have been of little benefit to the jury and predictably of less benefit to the appellant’s case. I agree with those comments. 
      
       
     74 I mentioned the absence of identification of intended witnesses. If it is intended to suggest that the appellant’s wife might have been called then it is pertinent to observe what happened when she was called during the sentencing proceedings. In cross examination she agreed that she had written letters to the complainant twice in November 1994 encouraging her to change her account of what happened and to withdraw her complaints. It is also difficult to see how it would materially assist the appellant’s case if it were revealed that he initially lied to his wife by claiming that sexual intercourse between himself and the complainant had happened only once when later he conceded to “an affair”.  
      
       
     75 In relation to grounds such as the present it is appropriate to look at the reasonableness of the conduct of the appellant in all circumstances: R v Kennedy 1997 94 A Crim R 341. Such observation should not, however, deflect from attention upon the central issue of whether the trial which has taken place can be perceived to have been unfair. It is appropriate to form a conclusion in the circumstances pertaining to the appellant’s health. 
      
       
        
       The Appellant’s Health 
       
     76 Grounds 4, 7 and 8 can be dealt with together. As already recorded the appellant sought postponement of the trial before it began on the grounds of his state of health. As accurately stated in the appellant’s written submissions, prior to and during the course of the trial numerous medical reports were tendered. In summary terms, it was put: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence that was before the Court was that the appellant was suffering from a severe blood viral infection. Subsequent testing, including blood testing, resulted in a specialist physician diagnosing the appellant as suffering from a non specific viral hepatitis.” 
         
        
       
     77 There were also available for reference results of numerous liver function tests. The issue is not to determine any precise clinical picture but whether the appellant was so affected by health problems that the trial should be categorized as unfair. The appellant’s treating general practitioner was Dr Andrew Pritchard Davies. He saw the appellant during the trial on 2 and 5 May. In a report of 8 May he suggested, and he suggested no more than, that the court should take into account the appellant’s condition when “setting days and sitting time”. He saw the appellant again on 1 June during the trial but did not expressly report in relation to this until afterwards.  
      
       
     78 It would be unnecessarily tedious to detail how comprehensively her Honour applied the doctor’s cautions. Counsel for the appellant has tabulated references to expressions of discomfiture by his client. On occasions the appellant said he was tired or that his memory was failing. A particular mention in this context was made of an intention to call his wife as a witness. Her Honour advised him that if that was the intent she should remain outside until called. I have made some observations about potential cross examination of her and will not repeat them. It might be mentioned in passing that this occurred prior to the calling of the complainant and a consequence was that she did not hear that evidence including the appellant’s cross examination. The delay followed, inter alia, the conduct of a Basha enquiry concerning some other Crown evidence. The appellant’s remarks need to be weighed with the medical material and the extent of accommodation suggested by it. The Crown submissions give some twenty three transcript references as examples of accommodations. At no time did the appellant, after the commencement, apply for the adjournment of the trial other than for limited periods and these were, when requested, granted. In the course of giving appropriate guidance to the unrepresented appellant this exchange occurred between him and the learned trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Indeed, if you find at any time during the course of the trial ………….. that you need a break, you may raise that with me ……… should you fall ill during the trial the court will be adjourned until such time as it is a reasonable time that you are fit to be able to resume ……….. the court would require medical certificates in relation to anything that might extend more than a day. You understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I understand.” 
         
        
       
     79 Dr Pritchard Davies has sworn an affidavit on 27 February 2001 which also mentioned the occurrence of a poisoned foot which required removal of tissue and antibiotics treatment which would have added to the appellant’s “general debilitation”. This treatment occurred on 5 May 2000. In a post trial letter dated 28 August 2000 addressed to solicitors now acting for the appellant Dr Pritchard Davies wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “My opinion is that it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible, for (BKK) to adequately perform or concentrate adequately during his trial period because of the chronic and debilitating nature of his illness. After a chronic and debilitating illness it may often take months to regain full strength and condition that allows you to perform to the best of your ability.” 
         
        
       
     80 It is not a test of integrity of trial to consider whether an accused is performing to the best of ability. Many factors as well as health might affect attainment of the superlative. The issue is fairness of the trial and the capacity of the appellant as a factor in that, seen with the benefit of hindsight. 
      
       
     81 The absence of hindrance is forcefully demonstrated by two aspects of the appellant’s conduct of his case. First, he was able to put minute detail in cross examination and second, he was able to produce and utilize in that cross examination a prodigious quantity of documentation. 
      
       
     82 Examples of the first are his contentions concerning conversations, some of them extending back as far as 1979 to 1981; descriptions of food the family ate for dinner on the dates of particular alleged offences, pizza on 23 September 1989 and chicken and chips (with lollies) in January 1994; film videos watched identified by title on the occasion of the alleged offence at Bermagui and series of dates and times concerning the date of adoption, the complainant becoming an Australian citizen, the family leaving Fiji, the family leaving Emerald, staying at Botany Caravan Park, Narrabeen Caravan Park, speaking to the Head of TAFE, the holiday in Bermagui and the time the complainant arrived home on 30 September 1994.  
      
       
     83 Examples of the second included production of a family tree; books and pamphlets on sex education; an article from New Weekly magazine; school reports; fitness centre cards; learner driver’s licence; church rosters; photographs; greeting cards; lease agreements and other dated documentary records.  
      
       
     84 This topic should not be passed without mention that the Crown produced opinion from Professor McCaughan, Director of the A. W. Morrow Gastroenterology and Liver Centre who opined that it was not possible to make a diagnosis of “viral hepatitis” upon the evidence available, that it was possible that the liver blood tests were abnormal secondary to a general illness and that there was no evidence for a definitive diagnosis of the stated illness to be found. 
      
       
     85 There is a second aspect to considerations touching upon the appellant’s state of health. This is the suggestion that the appellant suffers from obsessive compulsive personality disorder and that a person suffering from such disorder should not conduct his or her own defence to criminal charges.  
      
       
     86 Dr Clark who has made this diagnosis describes the condition in these terms in a short letter dated 13 April 1999: 
      
       
        
         
         “This means that he becomes stuck in detail, lost in his perfectionism, such that he finds it difficult to complete tasks. He is pre-occupied so that the major point of many activities is lost. He is unable to work with others unless they submissively agree to his way of doing things.” 
         
        
       
     87 The only other material from Dr Clark is dated 17 July 2000 (post-trial) and states that the appellant is depressed and unable to organize his affairs properly and needs time to “complete his appeal”. 
      
       
     88 The Crown asked Dr Bruce Westmore another psychiatrist to consider the matter. In his report he emphasied that he did not see the appellant. Dr Westmore theorized that if Dr Clark’s diagnosis was correct then it is possible that such a disorder would adversely affect an individual’s ability to represent themselves, particularly in a long and complex trial. He suggested that a possible disadvantage would be an inability to identify or discern important issues from unimportant ones because of lack of legal background. Dr Westmore was also provided with information concerning the suggested viral illness and he expressed this opinion: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the final analysis in this particular case, I think the issue of his ‘fitness’ to conduct his own affairs is more related to physical medicine rather than psychiatric medicine. Having considered the documents and this matter, my final conclusion is that it would probably be unsafe to assume that this man could represent himself, to his best advantage, given his potentially physically debilitating disease and its impact on him both physically and from a psychological and psychiatric perspective. There is insufficient history of the psychiatric report of Dr Clark(e), that is insufficient detail of this man’s symptoms and how they might affect him in court to provide an opinion as to whether the diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder played a primary role in any fitness alleged by this man. I note that Dr Clark(e) did not indicate that he was unfit to be tried from Presser perspective and a detailed description of his mental state, specifically a cognitive assessment was not described in Dr Clark(e)’s report of 8 August 2000. This further adds to the difficulties in expressing an opinion about whether the viral hepatitis was affecting this man’s attention and concentration and his memory functions.” 
         
        
       
     89 The ability of the appellant to give an account of himself in the sense of representing himself adequately so as to render the trial in which he participated not unfair can be judged not only from his abilities to cross examine but from his address to the jury which has been transcribed. The transcript of the appellant’s address extends over some sixty pages. In confirmation of what has been said in relation to counts six to thirteen the appellant referred to anguish and pain and added “the anguish and the pain is understandable and so is the anger because for any man such as myself to stand here and say to you I had an affair with my daughter is reprehensible, it’s abhorrent. I never denied it because that’s what I said.” (Extract transcript p2). 
      
       
     90 The instant question is whether the difficulties in thought process and articulation mentioned by Dr Clark have been manifest in this and other aspects of the appellant’s conduct of his defence. No point will be served by reproduction of the transcript of address but it shows an attempt (insofar as the evidence permitted it) to grapple with the strength of the Crown case and a collated and targeted expression of the assertions that the appellant advanced in cross examination. Insofar as complaints have since been made that the appellant was too exhausted at the end of the day to attend to transcripts it might be noted that at the end of address he commented upon the content of it and his understanding of the conventions of advocacy is illustrated by his final remarks namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “We’ve covered the issues of guilt. Therefore in totality, I’d like to say to you that in sum total, the evidence as a whole has not been substantiated by the case by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt according to the facts presented and then I ask you again, if yo can separate out the emotional from the objective criterias (sic) required to be put concerning the proven facts and substantive facts to support each criminal charge, I say the Crown has failed and the verdicts therefore must be not guilty. Thank you.” 
         
        
       
     91 An assessment of whether the trial has been unfair involves consideration of the foregoing matters in combination relating to both state of health and absence of legal representation. In my assessment the trial was not unfair and I would reject all of the grounds advanced. 
      
       
        
       The Name of the Victim (Ground 6) 
       
     92 An indictment, obviously erroneously, nominated the complainant’s twin sister as the victim in some counts. The transcript (pages 5 to 7) shows that the appellant was arraigned upon an indictment showing no such error and goes on to record that the Crown Prosecutor read a list of witnesses and the jury was then empanelled, presumably from a panel in waiting when the indictment would have been read. There is no substance in this ground. 
      
       
        
       Alleged Errors in the Judge’s Charge to the Jury 
       
     93 Grounds 9 to 13 inclusive identified various subject matters upon which her Honour is asserted to have erred but the grounds do not, as they should, identify the errors asserted. That said, the complaints encapsulated by the grounds can be dealt with seriatim in accordance with matters raised in submissions. 
      
       
     94 The first of these grounds related to her Honour’s directions to the jury concerning evidence of complaint. As already noted, complaint following the event giving rise to the thirteenth count was made after the complainant attended work on the following day. Counsel for the appellant referred to evidence given by the appellant’s wife after conviction including a version of the facts relating to complaint and it was contended that that evidence should have been before the jury. The Evidence Act assumes that members of the family of an accused person, including spouses, are compellable witnesses but compulsion is limited by express rights of objection vested by s18. Having regard to the appellant’s wife’s admissions of her attempts to persuade the complainant to vary her allegation or to withdraw it, I cannot perceive how the appellant can sensibly claim to have been disadvantaged by the absence of his wife from the witness box as a Crown witness.  
      
       
     95 As counsel for the Crown pointed out no precise error is identified in support of this ground. In the absence of such identification this ground cannot be sustained.  
      
       
     96 The next ground makes complaints in relation to directions concerning corroboration. To a large extent any complaint in relation to this has been dealt with in consideration of the application to this case of the principles stated in Doggett. In this case there was evidence capable of amounting to corroboration including the telephone conversation between the appellant and his brother and remarks to his sister in law and to the husband of the complainant’s twin sister. However, the appellant’s complaint should be dismissed in the light of the circumstance that, notwithstanding the express provisions of the Evidence Act in deleting former obligation to warn a jury about acting on uncorroborated evidence (s164(3)) the learned trial judge, although adverting to the potentially corroborating evidence, gave the jury instructions which included: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case stands or falls on the complainant’s evidence” 
         
        
        
         
         and 
         
        
        
         
         “The Crown case depends upon the complainant and must be scrutinized carefully” 
         
        
        
         
         and 
         
        
        
         
         “There are no witnesses to support the complainant to say they had witnessed the offences”. 
         
        
       
     97 Ground 11 relates to the appellant’s prior good character. Directions were given to the jury in this regard and the asserted deficiency is again not identified.  
      
       
     98 In cross reference to earlier grounds, it was submitted that the failure by the appellant to call positive evidence of good character was a major blunder inspired by his inability to represent himself. The value of such evidence would need to be assessed and three comments might be made: first, that there was no suggestion of anything adverse to the appellant other than the offences charged, second his own assessment of his behaviour was starkly sketched in the short passage from his address to the jury including adjectives “reprehensible” and “abhorrent” which is set out above and third her Honour gave the appellant express advice in this regard at the beginning of the proceedings. 
      
       
     99 Ground twelve referred to the appellant’s failure to give evidence. Reference is made to RPS v The Queen 2000 199 CLR 620 and Azzopardi v The Queen 2001 75 ALJR 931. The appellant’s submissions included a long list of suggested assistance which a judge might give to a jury concerning fact finding but such is not comprehended within the ground as expressed. The necessity for elaboration to the extent suggested is somewhat obscure. Her Honour had given conventional instructions on this matter and I do not perceive that more was required. Reduced to critical terms, the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt in relation to counts one to five that certain sexual actions occurred, the occurrence of which the appellant denied. In relation to counts six to thirteen, the Crown was required to prove the absence of consent to sexual congress between the appellant and the complainant, which congress was not in dispute.  
      
       
     100 Her Honour did give the jury instructions in relation to the absence of the appellant from the witness box but it can be observed that her directions were in language about which it was said in RPS that no complaint could be made.  
      
       
     101 Ground thirteen was sought to be supported by the absence from mention in the Judge’s charge to the jury of the circumstance that the Crown could have called the appellant’s wife to give evidence (subject to s18 of the Evidence Act). The argument in this regard is simply untenable. It was not the Crown case that the complainant had spoken to her mother and it adduced evidence from her explaining her failure to do so.  
      
       
     102 There was no comment made nor any identified suggestion of inference whereby her Honour invited the jury to consider that it could be expected that the appellant would call his wife as a witness. 
      
       
     103 None of these grounds have been made out. 
      
       
        
        
        
       Grounds Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen 
       
     104 These grounds relate to sentence. Having regard to the opinion already expressed concerning the outcome of the appeal in relation to counts one to five, the matter should be remitted to the District Court where sentence can be dealt with in accordance with the outcome of the new trial if it is held or, if prosecutorial discretion is exercised not to seek to retry those counts, sentence be reassessed and imposed in relation to conviction on counts six to thirteen only. 
      
       
     105 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (1) The appeal be allowed in part; 
        
       (2) The convictions and sentences on counts one to five of the indictment be quashed and a new trial ordered in respect of such counts; 
        
       (3) The sentences in respect of counts six to thirteen be quashed and the matter of sentence in respect of those counts remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. 
        
       
     106 SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and with his reasons. 
      
       
     107 I wish to add some short observations of my own, which encapsulate why, in my view, the Longman v R direction was required in relation to certain of the counts and not in relation to others. 
      
       
     108 The rationale of the Longman v R direction appears to be that there is a special risk of the accused being wrongly convicted in a sexual offence case where the events occurred a long time ago. That, as explained in GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493 by Heydon JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ agreed), may be because the accused might not be able to obtain evidence or information which would have been available earlier (per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 90); or, in the case of a child complainant, because children are prone to fantasy which may be distinguished by contemporaneous questioning but which can harden into an absolute conviction of reality with the long passage of time (per Deane J at 100-101); or because recollection of events which occur in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and to the possibility that it may not even be genuine (per McHugh at 107-108). In relation to these considerations, as discussed in Longman, Heydon JA said, at [57]: 
      
       
        
         
         [I]t is impossible to escape from the conclusion that if delay causes either forensic prejudice to the accused in the particular circumstances, or risks of the type described by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R, a warning must be given. The passages which support that conclusion cannot be read down or evaded. 
         
        
       
     109 Once sufficient time has elapsed to be material in any such respect, the absence of a Longman direction will be excused only if special circumstances make the direction unnecessary. 
      
       
     110 Was there a sufficient lapse of time in this case to attract the prima facie need for such a direction? The offences were alleged to have occurred over the period 1987 to 1994. The earliest incident under counts 1 to 5 was in 1987, the most recent was on 7 June 1990. In relation to counts 6 to 13, the earliest incident was alleged to have occurred between 1 January and 31 March 1992, the most recent on 27 October 1994. The applicant was interviewed by police and charged on three counts in December 1994. He was committed for trial in May 1995. The materials before us do not disclose on which counts the appellant was charged in December 1994, nor on which counts he was committed for trial in May 1995. In these circumstances, insufficient time may have elapsed in relation to counts 6 to 13 before the appellant was apprised of those allegations. But a Longman direction was not required in relation to those counts for the reasons given by Grove J and in this judgment.  
      
       
     111 The position is different in relation to counts 1 to 5. In my view, the lapse of time was sufficient in relation to the later incidents in that series, even if the allegations were brought to the appellant’s attention as early as December 1994. It was unquestionably sufficient in relation to the earlier incidents in that series. So there was a prima facie requirement for the direction in relation to counts 1 to 5. 
      
       
     112 The special circumstances relied upon by the respondent, in the present case, as making the direction unnecessary, were (a), in relation to counts 6 to 13, that the only issue was consent; and (b), in relation to all counts, that the accused had demonstrated an unusual capacity for retrieval of detailed information about circumstantial situations and events. 
      
       
     113 There is substance in point (a). In view of the nature of the issue under counts 6 to 13, there was no serious possibility that extrinsic information, once existing but no longer available, might have made a difference to the outcome of the trial in relation to those counts. And the alleged acts relied upon under those counts occurred when the complainant was aged 17 to 20, so that the possibility of childhood fantasy did not arise. 
      
       
     114 By contrast, the issue in relation to counts 1 to 5 was whether the alleged acts had occurred at all. And they were alleged to have occurred when the complainant was aged 12 to 16. Much earlier acts were relied upon in support of these counts. The fact that a large amount of detailed information was available to the appellant at the trial does not dispel the risk that other information of importance might not have been, by reason of the passage of time. 
      
       
     115 These are the considerations which I would emphasise as distinguishing between the need for a Longman direction in relation to counts 6 to 13, and not in relation to counts 1 to 5.

GLEESON  CJ,  GUMMOW,  HAYNE,  CALLINAN  AND  HEYDON  JJ.      The 
appellants  were  tried  jointly,  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  South  Australia,  before 
Debelle J  and  a  jury,  and  convicted  of  murder,  wounding  with  intent  to  do 
grievous  bodily  harm,  and  attempted  armed  robbery.    They  were  sentenced  to 
lengthy terms of imprisonment.  A co-accused, Carlos Escalante, pleaded guilty 
to  murder,  wounding  with  intent  to  do  grievous  bodily  harm,  and  attempted 
armed robbery. 
 
 
Each appellant appealed unsuccessfully to the South Australian Court of 
Criminal  Appeal.    For  reasons  that  are  presently  immaterial,  the  appeals  were 
heard by differently constituted courts1.  The appeal to this Court concerns only 
the  convictions  of  murder,  and,  as  will  appear,  the  grounds  of  appeal  are 
relatively confined. 
 
The facts 
 
 
The events giving rise to the charges occurred at Stepney, an inner suburb 
of  Adelaide,  in  the  early  hours  of  Saturday  11 December  1999.    The  two 
appellants, with three other men (Carlos Escalante, Raylon Smith and Christian 
Sinclair),  were  in  a  stolen  car.    They  agreed  to  find  someone  to  ""roll""  for  a 
mobile  telephone.    The  appellant  Mkoka  agreed  in  cross-examination  that  this 
meant robbery involving force if necessary.  
 
 
The  five  men  were  travelling  away  from  the  city,  along  North  Terrace 
towards  its  intersection  with  Fullarton  Road.    As  the  car  approached  the 
intersection,  Sinclair,  who  was  in  the  front  passenger  seat,  noticed  two  men, 
Hillam  and  Bourne,  walking  in  the  same  direction  along  the  north  western 
footpath of North Terrace.  Hillam was speaking on a mobile telephone.  The car 
stopped  a  short  distance  behind  Hillam  and  Bourne.    The  two  appellants  and 
Escalante  left  the  car.    The  appellant  Mkoka  was  armed  with  a  cue  ball  in  a 
stocking (described as a ""cosh"").  The appellant Arulthilakan had with him in the 
car a knife wrapped in cardboard.  That knife came into the possession of Mkoka.  
Arulthilakan  said  that  he  took  the  knife,  still  wrapped  in  cardboard,  from  his 
jacket pocket, intending to leave it on the back seat of the car.  Mkoka asked if he 
could take the knife with him.  Arulthilakan agreed.

Escalante was also carrying a knife.  It was not in dispute that this was the 
knife that was used  to stab Hillam and Bourne. The  blade  of Escalante's  knife 
was about 18 centimetres long.  Its maximum width was 2.8 centimetres.  Mkoka 
was aware that Escalante regularly carried a knife, and he knew Escalante was 
carrying a knife on this occasion.  Arulthilakan said that he knew Escalante had a 
knife, and, of course, he had given Mkoka his own knife.   
 
 
The two appellants and Escalante accosted Hillam and Bourne, who kept 
walking.    They  crossed  the  intersection  diagonally  towards  a  hotel,  which  was 
closed.    The  three  men  followed.    Escalante  made  aggressive  demands  for  the 
mobile phone.  Hillam told the three men to go away.  Escalante rushed at him.  
Hillam punched Escalante and then felt a blow to his side.  He looked down and 
saw  that  he  had  been  stabbed.  Hillam  sustained  four  wounds.    Two  were 
relatively  minor: to the outside  of the left knee and to the left leg.  Two were 
substantial: one to the left chest, and another to the left flank.  He sought help 
from a passing taxi driver, entered the taxi, and asked the driver to take him to 
hospital.   
 
 
Meanwhile, Mkoka had moved towards Bourne when Escalante attacked 
Hillam.    He  dropped  the  knife  he  had  been  given  by  Arulthilakan  and  put  the 
cosh in his right hand.  He dropped the knife in order to get a better grip on the 
cosh.  He said that ""obviously a fight had started and [he] thought [Bourne] might 
go  and  help  [Hillam]  in  beating  up  [Escalante]"".    Mkoka  said  Bourne  came 
towards him.  There was a struggle between the two.  Mkoka said he swung the 
cosh  at  Bourne  and  hit  him  somewhere  in  the  upper  body.    There  followed  a 
period of grappling between the two, during which Mkoka attempted to use the 
cosh.  At some point in the struggle, Escalante intervened and stabbed Bourne.  
Mkoka  and  Bourne  fell  to  the  ground,  still  struggling.    Mkoka  then  struck 
Bourne, who released his grip.  Mkoka kicked him in the upper body.  Mkoka 
said he did not know of the stabbing of Bourne until they were back in the car.   
 
 
Hillam  gave  evidence  that  when  he  looked  back  from  the  taxi  he  saw 
Bourne in the middle of the intersection being kicked and punched by all three 
men.  
 
 
Bourne's death resulted from a stab wound to the right side of his chest, 
between the fifth and sixth ribs.  Expert evidence explained that the knife caused 
a puncture wound in the right atrium of Bourne’s heart and the resultant blood 
loss would have caused death within a few minutes.  There were other lacerations 
on his scalp consistent with blows from a blunt object.  There was no dispute at 
trial that the fatal blow was struck immediately before Bourne fell to the ground.

There was no specific evidence as to the total time that elapsed from when 
the  appellants  and  Escalante  alighted  from  the  car  until  the  fatal  stabbing  of 
Bourne.  In his summing up, the trial judge, without objection, suggested that it 
appeared from the evidence to have been a period of at most about two or three 
minutes. 
 
 
At the trial, the appellants sought to make out a case of self-defence.  The 
trial judge declined to leave self-defence to the jury.  In both cases, the Court of 
Criminal  Appeal  upheld  that  decision.    The  case  of  self-defence  was  hopeless, 
and the argument was not pursued in this Court.  The central issue in the present 
appeal concerns the complicity of the appellants in the stabbing by Escalante of 
Bourne.    In  that  respect,  the  defence  case  was  that  the  stabbing  of  Bourne  by 
Escalante was an independent act on his part, undertaken in the heat of an affray, 
and after any attempt at robbery had ceased.  Plainly, that case was rejected by 
the jury. 
 
The prosecution case of murder 
 
 
The prosecution case against each appellant on the charge of murder was 
left  to  the  jury  on  three  alternative  bases:  the  first  two  related  to  murder  at 
common law; the third related to what was described as statutory murder.  The 
grounds of appeal in this Court are confined to the directions given concerning 
statutory murder. 
 
 
In  relation  to  common  law  murder,  the  directions  proceeded  upon  the 
basis  that  the  prosecution  had  to  establish  that  Escalante  stabbed  Bourne, 
intending either to kill him, or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm.  On that 
assumption,  the  first  basis  on  which  murder  was  left  was  described  as  joint 
enterprise.  The prosecution case was that the two appellants were acting jointly 
with Escalante in pursuit of a common unlawful purpose (armed robbery) which 
could involve inflicting at least grievous bodily harm.  The jury were told that it 
was  necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  that  the  scope  of  the  agreement  or 
understanding between the three was such that the crime committed by Escalante 
was  either  in  their  actual  contemplation  or,  alternatively,  it  was  in  their 
contemplation that it was possible that one of them might, in the course of the 
attempted robbery, use a knife to cause grievous bodily harm.  The second basis 
was that the appellants aided and abetted Escalante in the murder of Bourne.  In 
that connection, the jury were told that the prosecution had to prove knowledge 
that Escalante intended to stab Bourne, and assistance or encouragement in the 
commission of the crime.  It is unnecessary to go into further detail concerning 
the case of common law murder.

In the alternative, the jury were invited to consider statutory murder.  As 
counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted,  the  possibility  that  the  jury  convicted  on 
the  Criminal  Law 
this  basis  cannot  be  disregarded. 
Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) provides: 
 

  Section 12A  of 

""12A.  A person who commits an intentional act of violence while acting 
in the course or furtherance of a major indictable offence punishable by 
imprisonment for ten years or more (other than abortion), and thus causes 
the death of another, is guilty of murder."" 

Armed  robbery  is  a  major  indictable  offence  of  the  kind  referred  to  in 

 
s 12A.   
 
The directions on statutory murder 
 
 
The trial judge began by telling the jury that the crime of statutory murder 
does not require an intention on the part of the accused to cause death or grievous 
bodily harm; the crime is committed if death results from an intentional act of 
violence perpetrated while acting in the course of or in furtherance of an armed 
robbery.  He said the first question for the jury to consider was whether the act of 
violence relied on by the prosecution was committed in the course of an armed 
robbery.  The case for the appellants was that, by the time any use of weapons 
occurred,  they  and  Escalante  were  resisting  a  counter-attack  from  Hillam  and 
Bourne, and defending themselves.  At least theoretically, therefore, there was an 
open question as to whether the act of violence (said to be the presentation of a 
knife by Escalante) occurred in the course of the robbery.  The defence claimed 
that, by the time the alleged act of violence had occurred, the attempted robbery 
was over.  The trial judge continued: 
 

 
""However, if you are satisfied of that fact, you must then consider 
three other questions.  The first is, was there an act of violence?  Ladies 
and gentlemen, I direct you, as a matter of law, that the introduction of the 
knife into this affray, for the purpose of threatening or intimidating, or for 
the purpose of stabbing another, is an act of violence.  It constitutes a form 
of assault.  If you find that Escalante presented the knife for the purpose of 
threatening or intimidating Hillam, or for the purpose of stabbing him, that 
constitutes an act of violence.  As you will hear in a moment, that is the 
act of violence upon which the prosecution relies. 

 
The next matter is whether the act of violence was intentional.  You 
may  think  that  the  presenting  of  the  knife  and  use  of  it  requires  a 
deliberate and intentional act.  It is not something which inadvertently or
--------

accidentally  occurs.    It  is  for  you  to  determine  whether  the  knife  was 
intentionally presented and used. 

 
The next question is  whether the act  of violence caused Bourne's 
death.  Ladies and gentlemen, the law takes a commonsense view about 
causation.  It looks  to see if there is a causal link or a causal connection 
between one act and another.  Did one act cause another to occur?  The act 
does not have to be the sole cause of the other act occurring.  It is enough 
if it is a substantial cause.  It is enough if it is shown that, but for that one 
event, all the other events would not have happened as they did. 

 
It is the Crown case that if the knife had not been  presented and 
used at the commencement of this attempted armed robbery, the death of 
Bourne could not have occurred.  It says that, having presented the knife, 
Escalante used it to stab Hillam and then to stab Bourne.  The Crown says 
he  was  attacking  both  for  the  purpose  of  the  armed  robbery,  or  for  the 
purpose of extricating themselves from it.  The defence says there is no 
possible causal link between the presenting of the knife at that early stage 
in the robbery, and the later stabbing of Bourne.  It says that Escalante had 
become  very  aggressive,  that  he  was  acting  quite  independently  of  the 
others, and that he made a separate decision to stab Bourne.    

 
You  will  decide,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  whether  you  are  satisfied 
that the presenting of the knife at the very outset of this attempted armed 
robbery caused Bourne's death. 

 
If you are satisfied the act of violence was committed whilst all the 
accused were in the course of the attempted armed robbery, or extricating 
themselves from it, there are two alternative routes by which it is open for 
you to find these accused guilty of statutory murder.  Again, it is either by 
the route of joint enterprise, or by the route of aiding and abetting. 

 
As to joint enterprise, if you are satisfied that all of the accused had 
the  common  purpose  that  they  would  roll  or  rob  Hillam,  and  for  the 
purpose of their joint enterprise they would be armed with knives and a 
billiard ball, that they would use the knives and billiard ball if necessary to 
achieve their purpose  in the  course of the attempted armed  robbery,  the 
knives or billiard ball would be used to threaten or intimidate the victims.  
I  realise  that  sounds  very  similar  to  the  concept  of  joint  enterprise  in 
relation  to  common  law  murder,  but  it  is  different  in  that  it  is  not 
necessary that any of the accused had an intention to cause death,  or to 
cause grievous bodily harm, or contemplated as part of the joint enterprise

the  possibility  that  the  use  of  the  knives  could  result  in  an  intentional 
inflicting of grievous bodily harm.  That is the difference between them. 

6. 
 

 
The case for both the Crown and the defence on this issue are very 
similar to those I have already outlined in relation to common law murder.  
As to joint enterprise, the prosecution says that all of this occurred in the 
course of the armed robbery, or whilst they were endeavouring to extricate 
themselves  from  it  and  remove  themselves  from  the  scene.    The 
prosecution says that this all plainly occurred in the course of the armed 
robbery.  Resistance, says the Crown, is always a real likelihood if you are 
going to commit an armed robbery.  They met that resistance.  Thus, they 
were  inextricably  involved  in  this  attempt  and  had  to  escape  from  it.  
Thus, says the Crown, it is plain that all of this occurred in the course of 
the commission of the armed robbery, and that the initial presentation of 
the knife for its use to threaten or to stab Hillam was a cause of the death 
of Bourne. 

 
The defence case, of course, is that by this time the robbery was all 
over, if it had ever started.  The defence case is that it was quite unrealistic 
to suppose that by the time these events occurred the robbery – there was 
any commission of an attempted armed robbery.  I remind you of what I 
have already said in relation to that in the context of either common law 
murder or the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 
The  defence  also  says  that  in  no  respect  is  it  fair  to  say  or  to 
conclude  that  the  initial  presenting  of  this  knife  at  the  early  stage  of 
attempted armed robbery, even if it was on foot, caused Bourne's death.  
Escalante was behaving, they said, quite aggressively and independently. 

 
Similarly, in the case of the question whether they aided or abetted 
Escalante in the commission of the offence, this is much the same as in 
relation to the earlier offences.  The prosecution case is that they did aid 
and  abet,  and  that  they  both  willingly  engaged  in  the  attempted  armed 
robbery, and that indicates their intent. 

 
The defence case is that there was a fight, each defending the other; 
they had no idea that knives would be used in the fight.  Mkoka, indeed, 
had  thrown  his  away.    All  they  were  doing  was  acting  in  their  own 
defence and in defence of each other."" 

17 

The  trial  judge  returned  to  the  matter  of  causation  at  the  end  of  his 

 
summing-up, when he said:

""You  have  to  be  satisfied  that  there  is  a  causal  link  between  the 
introduction of the knife into the affray, and the death of Bourne.  It is the 
Crown  case  that  if  the  knife  had  not  been  presented  and  used  at  the 
commencement  of  this  attempted  armed  robbery,  the  death  of  Bourne 
could not have occurred.  The Crown says that having introduced the knife 
into the affray, Escalante used it to stab Hillam, and then to stab Bourne.  
The Crown says he was attacking both Hillam and Bourne for the purpose 
of the armed robbery. 

 
The  defence,  I  repeat,  says  there  is  absolutely  no  possible  causal 
link between the presenting of the knife at this early stage of the affray, 
this  early  introduction  of  it  into  the  affray,  and  the  stabbing  of  Bourne, 
which, on any view, had to have occurred later.  It says that Escalante had 
become  very  aggressive.    It  says  not  even  Hillam  saw  the  knife  being 
presented.  It says that Escalante's aggression was such that he was acting 
quite  independently,  and  that  he  made  quite  a  separate  decision  to  stab 
Bourne  ...  so  says  the  defence,  there  is  no  causal  link  between  the 
introduction  of  this  knife  at  the  beginning  of  this  affray,  and  the  later 
stabbing of Bourne."" 

18 

19 

20 

 
To put into context the references, in explaining the defence case, to an 
""early stage of the affray"", and what occurred ""later"", it is to be remembered that 
the entire episode occupied about two or three minutes. 
 
 
In relation to the directions on causation, to which no objection was taken, 
it is to be noted that what the trial judge said about the subject was, of course, 
closely related to the competing cases as fought at the trial.  The defence case on 
causation was that Escalante's use of his knife was not part of the armed robbery 
which  all  three  men  had  undertaken  but  was,  rather,  an  independent  act  of 
aggression on his part in response to the violence that erupted when Hillam and 
Bourne resisted their pursuers.  The prosecution case was that Escalante's use of 
his  knife  was  part  of  the  armed  robbery,  and  that  the  response  of  Hillam  and 
Bourne was foreseeable and, indeed, the very kind of contingency for which the 
attackers  had  prepared  by  arming  themselves  with  knives  and  a  cosh.    Those 
were the competing views of the facts to which the concept of causation had to 
be applied.  
 
The grounds of appeal 
 
 
 

Two criticisms are now made of the directions set out above.

The  first  criticism  relates  to  the  first  paragraph  in  the  directions  quoted 
and, in particular, to the statement that, as a matter of law, the presentation of the 
knife by Escalante constituted an act of violence.  The respondent acknowledges 
that it would have been better if the learned judge had directed the jury that it was 
open to them to find as a fact that the presentation of the knife constituted an act 
of violence, or that the presentation of the knife was capable of being regarded as 
an act of violence.  Nevertheless, the respondent points to the whole of what was 
said in the paragraph, and to the hypothesis upon which the direction ""as a matter 
of law"" was given.  The jury were told that, if they found that Escalante presented 
the knife for the purpose of threatening or intimidating Hillam, or for the purpose 
of stabbing him, then that constituted an act of violence. 
 
In a report to the Court of Criminal Appeal the trial judge said:  ""The issue 
 
whether  the  presenting  of  the  knife  was  an  act  of  violence  was  argued  as  a 
question of law by all counsel.  No one objected to the manner in which it was 
left to the jury."" 
 
 
Whether an act is an act of violence is a question of fact.  There may be a 
question of law as to  whether an act is capable of being regarded  as an act of 
violence.  The judge invited the jury to find as a fact whether Escalante presented 
his knife for the purpose of threatening, or intimidating, or stabbing the owner of 
the mobile telephone.  On the assumption that they made such a finding of fact, 
the  jury  were  told  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  conduct  involved  an  act  of 
violence.  They should have been told that, as a matter of law, the conduct was 
capable of being regarded as an act of violence.  In the circumstances, however, 
it  makes  little  difference.    How  else  might  such  conduct  have  been  regarded?  
The  complaint  of  the  appellants  is  that  the  direction  foreclosed  an  issue.    In  a 
practical sense, there was no real issue.  If the jury made the finding of fact which 
formed  the  condition  upon  which  the  direction  of  law  was  given,  it  was  not 
reasonably  open  to  them  to  come  to  any  conclusion  other  than  that  the 
presentation  of  the  knife  was  an  act  of  violence.    The  directions  went  on  to 
outline  the  defence  case,  and  to  remind  the  jury  of  the  arguments  advanced 
against the conclusion of fact for which the prosecution contended.  If, however, 
that conclusion were drawn, then the further conclusion that what was involved 
was an act of violence was inescapable.  Technically, there was a misdirection, 
but it gave rise to no miscarriage of justice. 
 
The second criticism of the directions was not advanced either at trial or in 
 
the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It relates to what was said concerning causation.  
The ground of appeal is expressed as follows:

""... [the] directions:

(i) 

(ii) 

withdrew  from  the  jury's  consideration  the  issue  of  whether  the 
production  of  the  knife  by  [Escalante]  in  the  circumstances 
indicated by the trial judge, [was] a substantial or significant cause 
of the death of Bourne ...; 

had the effect as a matter of law of directing the jury that 'but for

and/or 

(iii)  withdrew  from  the  jury's  consideration  the  issue  whether  the 
production of the knife in the circumstances indicated by the trial 
judge,  was no  more than a  negligible or de  minimis cause of the 
death of Bourne, and hence not causative in law."" 

In  argument,  counsel  for  the  appellants  directed  attention  particularly  to 
 
the concluding sentence of the third of the paragraphs from the directions quoted 
above.  They submitted that a proper direction would have been that causation 
was a matter of fact for the jury, to be determined, applying common sense, but 
with an appreciation that they were deciding legal responsibility and that the act 
for which the accused was responsible must be a substantial or significant cause 
in  a  common  sense  and  practical  way,  but  need  not  be  the  sole  cause.    When 
those submissions are compared with what the trial judge said, it is evident that 
the principal difference is in the sentence earlier mentioned, and in particular, in 
the reference to a ""but for"" approach to causation.  The respondent agreed with 
the appellants as to what was described as ""the status of the 'but for' test in civil 
and criminal law"" and contended that, if there was a misdirection, there was no 
miscarriage of justice.  Reference was made on both sides to the judgments in 
this Court in Royall v The Queen2. 
 
 
the  question  of  causation  arose  required 
consideration  of  whether  an  intentional  act  of  violence  (the  presentation  by 
Escalante of a knife for one of the purposes earlier mentioned) in the course or 
furtherance  of  an  armed  robbery  was  a  cause  of  the  death  of  Bourne.    The 
defence  case  was  that  Escalante  was  acting,  not  in  the  course  of  the  planned 
robbery, but independently in response to the conduct of Hillam and Bourne, the 
attempted robbery having come to an end.

In Ryan v The Queen3, Windeyer J, dealing with the common law concept 

 
of felony murder, said4: 
 

10. 
 

 
""There was a time when a man was guilty of murder, and punished 
accordingly, if while doing any unlawful act he happened to kill another 
man, however unexpectedly and unintentionally.  This harsh rule became 
gradually  mitigated.   By  the eighteenth century, although a  man  who in 
the course of committing a crime unintentionally killed another might still 
for that reason be guilty of murder, this was only when the crime was a 
felony.  By the middle of the nineteenth century doubts had begun to be 
expressed  about  this  doctrine  ...    The  generally  accepted  rule  of  the 
common law today is, however, that an unintended killing in the course of 
or  in  connexion  with  a  felony  is  murder  if,  but  only  if,  the  felonious 
conduct involved violence or danger to some person."" 

 
In South Australia, the law on the subject is now to be found in s 12A; but 
what  was  said  by  Windeyer J  explains  the  genesis  of  the  statutory  provision.  
Causing the death of another by committing an intentional act of violence in the 
course  of  a  major  indictable  offence,  even  though  there  is  no  intent  to  kill  or 
cause grievous bodily harm, constitutes statutory murder. 
 
 
There  was  nothing  artificial  about  the  prosecution's  identification  of  the 
intentional act of violence on which it relied.  The plan upon which the appellants 
and  Escalante  embarked  was  to  ""roll""  Hillam  in  order  to  obtain  his  mobile 
telephone.  That involved robbery, accompanied, if necessary, by force.  Perhaps 
there  was  a  theoretical  possibility  that  Hillam  would  hand  over  the  telephone 
without resistance, but the three intending robbers had, between them, two knives 
and a cosh.  They were not intending to rely on their powers of verbal persuasion.  
They  had  equipped  themselves  to  deal  with  resistance.    The  appellants  knew 
Escalante was armed.  It was not difficult to infer why he was armed.  The jury 
came to the matter of causation on the assumption that they had already found 
that  Escalante  presented  his  knife  to  Hillam  for  the  purpose  of  threatening  or 
intimidating  or  stabbing  him.    That  was  how  he  introduced  his  knife  into  the 
proceedings.  That was an intentional act of violence, in the course or furtherance 
of a robbery.  Bearing in mind the events that unfolded, and the brief interval of 
time  in  which  they  occurred,  it  was  open  to  the  jury  to  find  that  the  act  of

violence was a substantial cause of the death of Bourne.  Once the jury found that 
Escalante had presented a knife to Hillam for the purpose described, then it was 
open to them to  reason that  the resistence of Hillam and Bourne,  the resulting 
struggle, and the fatal stabbing of Bourne, were all part of a sequence of events 
resulting from the act of violence.   Of course, the defence endeavoured to put a 
different complexion on the events.  But the jury rejected the defence case.  The 
question is whether there was error in the way in which the prosecution case was 
left to them and, if so, whether there was a miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
In  some  contexts,  the  identification  of  an  act  as  causing  the  death  of  a 
victim may be important because it will affect issues of voluntariness, intent, or 
other  matters  relevant  to  the  offence  charged.    Ryan5  and  Royall6  provide 
examples of the relationship between such issues and questions of causation.  In 
Ryan, where the accused shot the deceased, there were a number of possible, and 
significantly different, views open as to the manner in which the gun discharged.  
It  was  necessary  to  identify  the  various  possibilities,  and  give  appropriate 
directions, because, depending on which view was taken, the act of the accused 
which caused the death of the deceased might or might not have been voluntary.  
In Royall, the problem arose because, although it was clear that the victim fell to 
her death from the window of a sixth floor flat, there was uncertainty as to how 
she  came  to  fall  from  or  through  the  window,  and  there  was  a  question  of 
identifying an act of the accused which caused that fall.  A number of alternative 
possibilities  were  left  to  the  jury.    The  question  was  whether  the  trial  judge 
properly directed the jury as to the particular acts, any one of which they might 
regard  as  the  cause  of  the  deceased's  death.    The  question  was  significant 
because,  on  the  issue  of  intent,  different  matters  might  have  been  taken  into 
account,  depending  upon  which  act  of  the  deceased  was  identified  as  an  act 
which  caused  death7.    Of  the  various  possibilities  left  to  the  jury,  that  which 
required the most careful direction on causation and intent was a possibility that 
the victim had jumped from the window in response to aggressive conduct on the 
part  of  the  accused.    A  majority  of  the  Court  thought  the  directions  on  that 
possibility were satisfactory.  McHugh J disagreed, but found that there was no 
miscarriage  of  justice.    It  was  to  that  particular  problem  of  causation  that  the 
observations  of  the  various  members  of  the  Court  were  addressed.    It  was  the 
problem presented by the case of a victim who dies as a result of his or her own

act in the course of attempting to escape from an attacker.  That problem is far 
removed from the present case. 
 
 
 

Deane and Dawson JJ said:8 

""In a defenestration case such as the present one it is as likely as 
 
not that the accused will not have intended the deceased to meet his or her 
death by jumping from a window, but it is important to keep the question 
of  causation  separate  from  that  of  the  mental  state  required  for  murder.  
Provided  that  the  words  or  actions  of  the  accused  which  cause  the 
deceased to jump or fall from the window (that is, the words or actions 
which cause death) are accompanied by the requisite intent, that will be 
sufficient to constitute murder. 

 
Of  course,  there  may  be  no  single  cause  of  the  death  of  the 
deceased, but if the accused's conduct is a substantial or significant cause 
of  death  that  will  be  sufficient,  given  the  requisite  intent,  to  sustain  a 
conviction  of  murder.    It  is  for  the  jury  to  determine  whether  the 
connexion  between  the  conduct  of  the  accused  and  the  death  of  the 
deceased was sufficient to attribute causal responsibility to the accused."" 

 
McHugh J emphasised the particular difficulty  that arose on the facts of 
the case.  It was in that context that he made reference to the ""but for"" test.  He 
said:9 
 

""If [Royall's] conduct ... induced the deceased to jump out of the window 
so as to avoid further attack, it might be thought that 'but for' the attack the 
deceased would not have lost her life and that the applicant, therefore, had 
caused her death.  But this Court has recently rejected the proposition that 
in the law of negligence the test of causation at common law is the 'but for' 
test:    March  v  Stramare  (E  &  MH)  Pty  Ltd10.    In  criminal  cases,  the 
common law has also refused to apply the 'but for' test as the sole test of 
causation.  Nevertheless, the 'but for' test is a useful tool in criminal law 
for determining whether a causal link existed between an accused's act or 
omission and the relevant injury or damage.  But before a person will be

held  criminally  liable  for  his  or  her  act  or  omission,  the  causal  link 
between that act or omission and the injury or damage must be sufficiently 
cogent to justify attributing causal responsibility, ie legal responsibility, to 
that person."" (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original)

He went on to point out that difficult issues of causation could arise where 
 
an accused's act would not have brought about the event or occurrence without 
the intervention of a subsequent act of the victim or a third party.  In such cases, 
courts ""have sought to use more specific tests for determining whether 'but for' 
acts  or  omissions  of  the  accused  were  'causally  responsible'  for  the  event  or 
occurrence""11.  He concluded that, in a case of the kind he was considering, an 
accused  should  not  be  held  causally  responsible  unless  his  or  her  conduct 
induced the victim to take action which resulted in harm to him or her and that 
harm  was  either  intended  by  the  accused  or  was  of  a  type  which  a  reasonable 
person could have foreseen as a consequence of the accused's conduct12. 
 
 
In  the  present  case,  the  competing  arguments  on  causation  did  not  give 
rise to legal difficulties of the kind that arose in Royall.  On the prosecution case, 
a robbery was in progress from the time the three men left the stolen car until the 
time  of  the  fatal  stabbing  of  Bourne.    Their  purpose  was  to  rob  Hillam  of  his 
mobile telephone.  They were armed to threaten their victims, and to deal with 
any  resistance  they  might  encounter.    The  victims  resisted,  as  was  clearly 
foreseeable.    Escalante  used  his  knife  in  the  resulting  encounter,  first  stabbing 
Hillam,  and  then  Bourne.    His  presentation  of  the  knife  for  the  purpose  of 
threatening or stabbing Hillam was an act of violence in the course of an armed 
robbery, and the sequence of events was such that it could be, and ought to be, 
regarded as a substantial cause of the death of Bourne.  That was how the case 
was left to the jury.  The competing view of the case, which was fairly put to the 
jury, was as summarised in the last paragraph of the directions quoted above. 
 
The  directions  did  not  withdraw  from  the  jury  a  consideration  of  any 
 
factual issue that arose for decision.  One of the dangers of a ""but for"" test of 
causation is that, in some cases, it is capable of indicating that a negligible causal 
relationship  will  suffice,  but  that  was  not  a  realistic  risk  in  the  present  case, 
especially  where  the  trial  judge,  in  the  sentence  preceding  the  sentence  that  is 
now criticised, referred to ""a substantial cause"".  The concluding sentence in the

third of the paragraphs quoted above could not fairly be understood as qualifying 
the  previous  sentence.    The  two  sentences  were  plainly  intended  to  be  read 
together.    Evidently,  it  never  occurred  to  anyone  at  the  trial  that  the  judge 
intended to tell the jury that a negligible causal connection would suffice.  If that 
impression had been created, objection would surely have followed.  Now, two 
stages  removed  from  the  trial,  such  a  complaint  is  made  for  the  first  time.    It 
should be rejected. 
 
 
On  the  prosecution  case,  as  it  was  left  to  the  jury,  what  the  trial  judge 
described  as  ""the  introduction  [by  Escalante]  of  the  knife  into  the  affray""  was 
clearly capable of being regarded as a substantial cause of the death of Bourne, 
not  just  because,  if  Escalante  had  been  unarmed,  he  could  not  have  stabbed 
Bourne,  but  because  this  was  an  armed  robbery,  accompanied  by  the  obvious 
possibility  of  resistance  and  violent  struggle.    The  trial  judge  made  that  clear.  
The response of the defence at trial was, not to seek to meet that argument on its 
own terms, but to endeavour to persuade the jury to a view (or possible view) of 
the facts according to which, when Hillam and later Bourne were stabbed, there 
was  no  longer  an  armed  robbery  in  progress,  and  Escalante  was  acting 
independently of the appellants in his use of his knife.  The issues that arose in 
relation to causation were fairly put to the jury. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 

This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Both appeals should be dismissed.

KIRBY J.     These appeals from judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 
South Australia13 present four questions concerning the appellants' convictions of 
murder in accordance with the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) (""the 
Act"").    The  questions  should  be  answered  favourably  to  the  appellants.    Their 
convictions should be quashed and a new trial ordered. 
 
The facts, trial, directions and appeals 
 
 
The  background  facts  are  explained  in  the  reasons  of  Gleeson CJ, 
Gummow,  Hayne,  Callinan  and  Heydon JJ  (""the  joint  reasons"")14.    Also 
explained there are the three bases upon which the charge of murder was left to 
the jury in the joint trial of Mr Noel Arulthilakan and Mr Chiseko Mkoka (""the 
appellants"")15. 
 
 
The only issues argued in this Court concern the directions given to the 
jury  by  the  trial  judge  (Debelle J)  relating  to  statutory  murder  as  provided  in 
s 12A of the Act.  Most of the relevant directions of the trial judge concerning the 
requirements  of  the  Act  are  set  out  in  the  joint  reasons16.    Those  directions 
address  the  three  elements  appearing  in  the  definition  of  statutory  murder, 
namely (1) whether the conduct constituted ""an intentional act of violence""; (2) 
whether  such  conduct  was  committed  whilst  the  accused  were  acting  in  the 
course  or  furtherance  of  a  ""major  indictable  offence"";  and  (3)  whether  the 
intentional  act  of  violence  caused  the  death  of  Mr Matthew  Bourne  (""the 
deceased""). 
 
 
There  was  no  contest  that  armed  robbery  of  the  deceased  and  his 
companion Mr Colin  Hillam, the victims of the criminal conduct, constituted a 
""major  indictable  offence""  attracting  the  application  of  s 12A  of  the  Act.  
Accordingly, the argument in this Court focused on elements (1) and (3) of the 
statutory elements.  Whereas the appellants advanced their complaint about the 
directions on element (1) before the different benches of the Court of Criminal 
Appeal that heard their respective appeals, the complaint concerning the issue of 
causation,  raised  by  element  (3),  was  not  argued  until  the  matter  reached  this 
Court.

Before us, the appellants submitted that there was a material misdirection 
to the jury concerning the pertinent ""intentional act of violence"" disclosed by the 
evidence, relevant to the way the jury should approach this consideration.  They 
also argued that the directions on causation were erroneous.  They submitted that 
each of these misdirections of law, and especially cumulatively, deprived them of 
a  trial  according  to  law  and  occasioned  a  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice.  
Notwithstanding the earlier failure to take precise objection to the points argued 
in this Court, the appellants submitted that no impediment of a constitutional or 
discretionary  character  stood  in  the  way  of  the  determination  of  the  points  in 
these appeals in which the lawfulness of their convictions was still a live question 
for the decision of the judicature. 
 
The issues 
 
 
 
(1) 

The  new  appeal  ground  issue:    Whether  this  Court  should  allow  the 
appellants to raise the point concerning the adequacy of the trial judge's 
directions on causation, now argued for the first time. 

The four issues presented by the appeals are: 

The  intentional  act  of  violence  issue:    Whether  in  respect  of  statutory 
murder,  the  judge  misdirected  the  jury  on  the  law  relating  to  the 
""intentional act of violence"" as applicable to the requirements of the Act 
and  whether  the  presentation  of  a  knife  by  the  appellants'  co-accused, 
Mr Carlos Escalante, to the deceased's companion, Mr Hillam was capable 
of  constituting  an  ""intentional  act  of  violence""  for  the  purpose  of  the 
offence. 

The causation issue:  Whether the trial judge erred in law in the way in 
which  he  directed  the  jury  concerning  causation  in  respect  of  statutory 
murder. 

The proviso issue:  Whether, if the answers to the foregoing issues are in 
the  affirmative,  the  ""proviso""17  should  be  applied,  on  the  basis  that  no 
substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  has  actually  occurred  affecting  the 
convictions of the appellants. 

 
The additional grounds may be raised 
 
 
An earlier suggestion that, for constitutional reasons, a failure to raise and 
argue a ground of appeal was fatal to the consideration of the point by this Court,

having regard to the nature of the ""appeal"" to it18 (being a strict appeal), has been 
rejected19.  Where proceedings remain alive within the judicature, it  is open to 
this Court to permit new grounds of appeal to be added.   
 
 
Doing this, is subject to any relevant considerations of procedural fairness 
and to applicable discretionary factors.  Conventionally, one such discretionary 
factor, favouring rejection of a propounded new ground, is where it is concluded 
that the course taken at trial was adopted for reasons of forensic advantage.  I see 
no such consideration in the present case.  At all times, counsel for the appellants 
objected  to,  or  complained  about,  the  reliance  of  the  prosecution  on  statutory 
murder.  Specifically, at trial, counsel objected to the prosecution's argument that 
statutory  murder  was  available  in  relation  to  each  of  the  appellants  as  an 
alternative to ""common law murder"".  From the point of view of the appellants, 
the distinction between ""common law"" and statutory murder was one presenting 
serious forensic disadvantages.  Statutory  murder did not require proof beyond 
reasonable doubt of an intention on the part of each accused to cause death or 
grievous bodily harm to the deceased.  Nor did it require proof that the accused 
reasonably contemplated, as part of a joint enterprise, the possibility that use of 
knives could result in an intentional infliction at least of grievous bodily harm. 
 
 
The new point now raised by the appellants was clearly expressed at the 
special  leave  hearing.    The  adequacy  of  directions  on  the  issue  of  causation 
involves a point of law20.  It is alleged to affect the lawfulness of the conduct of 
the  appellants'  trial.    It  can  be  decided  by  this  Court  on  the  basis  of  the  trial 
transcript.  It has been fully argued.  If made good, subject to the ""proviso"", it 
requires  the  quashing  of  the  appellants'  convictions  for  most  serious  offences.  
Like the other members of the Court, I consider that the failure of the appellants 
to reserve the point at trial is not fatal to its determination by this Court.  The first 
issue should therefore be decided in favour of the appellants. 
 
The directions on ""act of violence"" were erroneous 
 
 
The  trial  judge  directed  the  jury  that  ""as  a  matter  of  law  …  the 
introduction of the knife [by Mr Escalante] … for the purpose of threatening or

intimidating,  or  for  the  purpose  of  stabbing  another,  is  an  act  of  violence"".  
Having regard to the language of this instruction, the jury would have felt bound 
to  comply  with  what  the  judge  told  them  was  a  direction  of  law.    The  judge 
reminded  the  jury  that  the  particular  ""act  of  violence""  relied  upon  by  the 
prosecution  was  the  introduction  of  the  knife  into  the  affray  by  Mr Escalante 
presenting the knife to the deceased's companion, Mr Hillam. 
 
 
I agree with the joint reasons that the direction on this point was erroneous 
in  law21.    Whether  any  particular  conduct  constituted  an  ""intentional  act  of 
violence"" was a question of fact for the jury; not a matter of law upon which the 
judge was entitled to direct the jury.  At most, the judge was entitled to say that, 
having  regard  to  the  evidence,  the  conduct  of  Mr Escalante  in  presenting  the 
knife  to  Mr Hillam  was  capable  of  being  regarded  by  them  as  a  relevant 
""intentional act of violence"".  He should have told the jury that it remained for 
them  (in  accordance  with  s 12A  of  the  Act)  to  determine  whether  that  act  of 
Mr Escalante in fact amounted to a relevant ""intentional act of violence"" in the 
case or not.  And that the onus of proof rested on the prosecution to establish that 
fact beyond reasonable doubt.   
 
 
More than once, in recent times, this Court has had occasion to insist that 
it is not the function of a judge in a criminal trial to direct the jury as to how they 
should  reason  towards  a  conclusion  of  guilt22.    Least  of  all  is  it for  a  judge to 
withdraw from the jury's consideration an essential factual element of the offence 
by informing them that the subject to be decided is a ""matter of law"", when it is 
in  truth  a  matter  of  fact.    The  correct  approach  for  the  judge  to  take  was  that 
observed  in  R v  Butcher23.    There,  in  respect  of  an  analogous  provision,  a 
direction that ""[i]t will be open … to find that the accused in fact committed an 
act of violence in holding the knife out the way he did …"" was approved.  By 
directing  the  jury  to  act  on  the  proposition  that  the  production  of  the  knife  by 
Mr Escalante was, as a matter of law, the relevant ""intentional act of violence"", 
effectively the trial judge gave the jury no option but to find that this was so. 
 
The joint reasons conclude that this misdirection was ""technically"" made 
 
out24. 
  If  by  ""technically"" 
the  misdirection  was 
inconsequential, I  disagree.   With respect  to the trial judge who conducted the 
trial with clarity and fairness, upon the hypothesis posited, that the jury convicted 
the  appellants  of  statutory  murder,  the  direction  wrongly  assumed  judicial

responsibility for a factual finding concerning one of the three relevant factual 
ingredients of the offence.  On the face of things, this is not a technical error but 
one that mis-stated an ingredient of the offence and the respective parts played in 
the trial by the judge and the jury. 
 
 
The issue of whether the error occasioned a miscarriage of justice within 
the  ""proviso""  raises  a  different  question.    It  is  one  that  only  arises  where  a 
misdirection  or  insufficient  direction  of  law  is  established,  as  it  is  here.    The 
""proviso"" issue should be dealt with separately and in conjunction with any other 
error(s) that are established.  Only then will the ""proviso"" be applied accurately 
in  relation  to  an  evaluation  of  the  overall  conduct  of  the  trial  and  of  the 
convictions resulting from it.  There are dangers in segregating suggested errors 
in a trial, disposing of them one by one as ""technical"" and failing to consider the 
effect of the errors cumulatively on the safety of the trial.  With respect, this is an 
error evident in the approach of the joint reasons.  It involves a misapplication of 
the ""proviso"" for that provision of the Act directs attention to the global question 
of whether there has  been a  miscarriage of justice.  That question  can only be 
answered when the entirety of the trial is considered, including every established 
error or misdirection of law that occurred within it.  The decisions must be made 
taking distinct steps. 
 
The directions on causation were erroneous 
 
The appellants complained about the trial judge's directions on the third 
 
element in the definition of statutory murder.  They accepted that the judge was 
correct in instructing the jury that the specified ""act of violence"", as defined, did 
not have to be the sole cause of the deceased's death and that it was enough if it 
was  a  substantial  cause.    That  this  is  so  is  shown  by  much  authority25.    No 
complaint was made about the judge's direction that it was enough for the jury to 
decide  that  Mr Escalante's  presentation  of  the  knife  to  Mr Hillam  was  a 
""substantial cause"" of the deceased's death for which the appellants were liable 
under  the  Act.    The  judge  also  referred  in  his  directions  on  causation  to 
""commonsense"".  To that extent, he mentioned a consideration which this Court, 
both in civil26 and criminal27, cases has said the decision-maker  must  take into 
account in resolving contested questions of causation.

causation in two particular ways: 
 
(1) 

20. 
 

The complaint of the appellants was that the judge misdirected the jury on 

In his reference to ""commonsense"", he did not instruct the jury that it was 
their commonsense that they should bring to bear in the resolution of the 
causation problem.  Instead, he stated that ""the law takes a commonsense 
view  about  causation"".    As  so  expressed,  the  direction  could  have  been 
understood to be one of law made by the judge, not one of fact left to the 
jury to decide; and 

 
(2) 

The judge told the jury (with emphasis added) that ""[i]t is enough if it is 
shown  that,  but  for  that  one  event,  all  the  other  events  would  not  have 
happened as they did"". 

 
 
Contested issues of causation are amongst the most difficult that have to 
be resolved in the law, as in other fields where aetiology is in issue28.  In Ryan v 
The Queen29, Barwick CJ emphasised that ""the choice of the act causing death is 
not for the presiding judge or for the Court of Criminal Appeal:  it is essentially a 
matter for the jury under proper direction"".  In that case, Barwick CJ pointed out 
that  the  mere  presentation  of  a  gun,  which  subsequently  discharged  allegedly 
without intention on the part of the accused, could only be the cause of death if 
the unwilled discharge of the gun ought to have been in the contemplation of the 
accused at the time.  This analysis  makes vital the correct identification of the 
event propounded as the ""cause"" and accurate instruction on the proper approach 
of the jury to linking that event with a subsequent one.  Here, the propounded 
primary event was Mr Escalante's presentation of the knife to Mr Hillam.  The 
propounded secondary event was the stabbing of the deceased by Mr Escalante 
which was the immediate cause of his death.  It was essential that  each of the 
events  be  clearly  identified  and  drawn  to  the  jury's  notice  with  accurate 
instruction  on  the  way  the  relevant  statutory  concept  of  causation  was  to  be 
approached.  Otherwise, there would be a misdirection or a failure to direct the 
jury  adequately  on  the  law  essential  to  the  third  element  of  the  offence  of 
statutory murder. 
 
 
As to the first complaint, concerning the judge's failure to tell the jury that 
it  was  their  commonsense  which  they  had  to  bring  to  bear  in  the  causation 
question, I would not find error.  In the context, the trial judge was telling the 
jury  the  approach  they  should  take.    That  is  how  I  consider  they  would  have 
interpreted what his Honour said.

The  reference  to  the  ""but  for""  test  of  causation  is,  however,  a  legal 
misdirection.  In civil cases, this Court in March v Stramare (E & M H) Pty Ltd30 
rejected the ""but for"" test as the exclusive test of causation.  At most, the ""but 
for"" test can only constitute a ""threshold test for determining whether a particular 
act  or  omission  qualifies  as  a  cause""31.    It  is  insufficient  to  ""make  that  act  or 
omission a legal cause of the damage""32.  The problem of the ""but for"" test is that, 
on its own, it casts the net of causation too widely.  It includes acts of a remote 
and peripheral or purely temporal connection which have no part to play in the 
determination of the ""legal cause"".   
 
 
There is no reason for the test of causation for the purposes of attaching 
criminal liability to be different from that adopted by this Court in cases of civil 
liability.  If anything, the reasons that have led to the rejection of the ""but for"" 
test  in  civil  trials  have  greater  applicability  in  the  context  of  the  criminal  law.  
This is because, as McHugh J pointed out in Royall v The Queen33, the inquiry is 
one  addressed  to  whether  a  link  has  been  proved  by  the  prosecution  that  is 
""sufficiently  cogent 
legal 
responsibility, to that person"". 
 
 
In this Court, the respondent agreed with the appellants' submission that 
the  ""but  for""  test  for  determining  criminal  responsibility  was  inadequate  and 
incomplete.  In effect, it did not seek to support the directions to the jury of the 
trial judge on that issue.  Instead, it sought to defend the outcome of the trial by 
reference to the ""proviso"" and to an alternative contention.   
 
 
It  follows  that  the  jury  were  erroneously  instructed  as  to  the  test  of 
causation that they were to apply to the supposed link between the presentation 
by Mr Escalante of a knife to threaten Mr Hillam and the death of the deceased 
shortly thereafter.  There was thus a cumulative misdirection of law.  It affected 
the  third  element  of  statutory  murder  upon  which  the  prosecution  relied.    The 
appellants have therefore made out their complaint that the conduct of their trial

was  tainted  by  legal  error.    This  enlivens,  effectively  for  the  first  time,  the 
provisions of the ""proviso"".  Given the unanimous rulings of this Court on the 
misdirections, and the very proper concessions for the respondent in that regard, 
essentially this is an appeal concerned with the ""proviso"".  That is so because it is 
established, or conceded, that errors of law occurred in the directions given by 
the trial judge to the appellants' jury. 
 
The proviso is inapplicable 
 
Requirement of accurate trials:  The starting point for the consideration of 
 
the ""proviso"" is a reminder of the fundamental postulate of our criminal law that 
everyone facing trial by jury is entitled to have the jury accurately instructed on 
the law that they are to apply.  That is especially true in respect of the elements 
constituting the offence(s) upon which the jury is asked to reach their verdict.  It 
is of particular importance that the jury be accurately instructed in a case, as here, 
where the offences charged were that of murder, the most serious offence in the 
criminal calendar34.  Because conviction of murder ordinarily, as here, results in a 
sentence  of  life  imprisonment,  with  consequential  prolonged  deprivation  of 
liberty35,  and  because  each  of  the  appellants  was  a  juvenile  at  the  time  of  the 
offence and of his trial36, these facts constitute further contextual considerations 
that oblige this Court to examine very closely all of the matters relevant to the 
trial,  before  affirming  convictions  that  followed  guilty  verdicts  preceded  by 
erroneous legal directions on the elements of the offence of which the appellants 
were found guilty.   
 
 
Where legal error in the directions to a criminal jury is shown, it is for the 
prosecution  to  establish  affirmatively  that  no  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice 
has actually occurred.  This means that the prosecution must demonstrate that the 
error  that  is  established  could  not  reasonably  have  been  supposed  to  have 
affected the result of the trial37 or, as it is sometimes put, that the convictions of 
the appellants were inevitable38.

Inferring  the  jury's  reasoning:    The  verdicts  taken  from  the  jury  in  the 
 
appellants'  trial  did  not  differentiate  between  the  respective  ways  in  which  the 
count  of  murder  was  decided.    That  count  was  charged  by  reference  to  the 
common  law  applicable  in  South  Australia39  and  also  to  statutory  murder, 
formerly known as felony murder, as now provided by the Act40.  The trial judge 
directed  the  jury  on  the  count  of  murder  as  defined  at  common  law  and  then 
explained  the  elements  of  statutory  murder.    Because  there  is  no  way  of 
discovering with certainty how the jury proceeded in their reasoning, and because 
the  verdicts  themselves  are  inconclusive  in  this  regard,  it  is  a  matter  of 
speculation  as  to  whether  the  jury  proceeded  first  by  the  ""common  law""  route 
(involving  consideration  of  the  alleged  common  purpose  of  the  appellants  and 
Mr Escalante)  or  whether  they  first  considered  statutory  murder  (with  its  more 
restricted  elements,  requiring  no  specific  finding  that  the  appellants  each 
intended the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the deceased or was to be taken 
to have so intended by the circumstances in which that death occurred). 
 
 
Before this Court, each side presented competing arguments on this issue.  
The  respondent  suggested  that  the  manner  in  which  the  judge's  directions 
proceeded and the logic of the case indicated that the first way in which the jury 
would have determined the guilt of the appellants was by reference to common 
law  principles,  involving  the  identification  of  the  common  purpose  of  the 
appellants and Mr Escalante.  On the other hand, the appellants submitted that the 
jury may well have found the test for statutory murder a simpler point at which to 

                                                                                                                                     
39   The Act, s 11.  That section provides:  ""Any person who commits murder shall be 
guilty  of  an  offence  and  shall  be  imprisoned  for  life"".    Although  described  as 
common law murder, it is in fact a statutory offence whose ingredients are defined 
by the common law. 

40   The  Act,  s 12A.    The  section  was  inserted  in  the  Act  by  the  Criminal  Law 
Consolidation  (Felonies  and  Misdemeanours)  Amendment  Act  1994,  s 5.    The 
amendment followed a Discussion Paper by Goode, ""The Abolition of Felonies and 
Misdemeanours"",  Attorney-General's  Department  (SA)  1994.    In  the  paper  the 
author cites Professor Fisse's  criticism that felony  murder was ""a barbarous relic 
which quite unnecessarily  complicates the  law"":  Fisse, Howard's Criminal Law, 
5th ed (1990) at 71.  See also Lanham, ""Felony Murder – Ancient and Modern"", 
(1983) 7 Criminal Law Journal 90 at 101.  Numerous law reform bodies had urged 
abolition.    In  Canada,  felony  murder  was  found  to  be  contrary  to  the  Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms:  see R v Vaillancourt (1987) 39 CCC (3d) 118.  
The  Discussion  Paper  urged  retention  of  ""statutory  murder""  on  the  basis  of  its 
""popular  appeal"":    see  Goode,  ""The  Abolition  of  Felonies  and  Misdemeanours"",

begin  their  deliberations,  having  regard  to  the  confined  scope  of  the  statutory 
definition, particularly following the misdirections of law of the trial judge.   
 
 
As a matter of logical inference, there is some ground for preferring the 
submission  that  the  jury  would  probably  have  first  considered  the  question  of 
whether statutory murder had been made out.  Counsel for the prosecution told 
the jury that ""… above all else, in this trial, that one offence [statutory murder] is 
abundantly  clear"".    The  jury  might  well  have  agreed.    Accurately  described, 
statutory murder omitted disputable considerations relevant to the intentions and 
purposes  of  the  appellants.    It  therefore  seems  distinctly  possible  that  the  jury 
might have proceeded to decide their verdict on the basis of statutory murder first 
without considering the common law principles at all. 
 
 
Against this proposition, the respondent contended that the jury's verdicts 
finding  the  appellants  guilty  on  the  third  count  (which  charged  the  appellants 
with  wounding  Mr Hillam)41  were  an  indication  that  the  jury  had  reached  a 
conclusion  that  the  appellants  had  engaged  in  an  unlawful  joint  enterprise  in 
respect  of  Mr Hillam.    This  indicated,  so  it  was  argued,  that  the  jury  had 
considered  the  intention  of  the  appellants  in  respect  of  the  offence  against 
Mr Hillam.  From this, the respondent urged it was but a small step to infer that 
the jury similarly decided their verdicts on the count of murder on the footing of 
the  common  intention  of  the  appellants  and  Mr Escalante,  directed  to  the 
wounding of the deceased that caused his death.  Further, the structure of the trial 
judge's  instructions  to  the  jury  placed  emphasis  upon  murder  at  common  law.  
His Honour dealt with that first and then gave his directions on statutory murder 
stating that ""[t]he Crown simply puts it forward as an alternative route by which 
you can find the accused guilty of the crime of murder"". 
 
 
Whilst it is certainly possible that the jury dealt first with ""common law"" 
murder, it is impossible to be certain.  Thus the charge concerning the wounding 
of Mr Hillam was quite distinct from that of the murder of the deceased.  That 
wounding happened earlier in time.  It occurred in a different place.  It involved a 
different  victim.    The  jury  were  correctly  instructed  to  consider  each  of  the 
counts  separately.    The  issue  of  intention  in  relation  to  Mr Hillam  had  to  be 
decided to reach a verdict on the third count.  It did not have to be decided in 
relation to the more serious first count if the route of statutory murder was taken.  
The verdict on the third count does not inevitably demonstrate that the appellants 
were  convicted  of  murder  on  the  basis  of  the  ""common  law""42.    In  the  end, 
therefore, identification of the jury's basis for reaching the verdicts of murder is a 
matter of pure speculation.

Was conviction inevitable?  This being the case, the approach that must be 
 
followed  is  that  adopted  in  Domican v  The  Queen43.    That  was  an  appeal 
involving directions  on identification evidence which were found to have been 
inadequate in what was otherwise a very strong prosecution case.  The majority 
of this Court concluded that the ""proviso"" could not be applied to overcome the 
misdirection  unless  the  Court,  invited  to  apply  the  proviso,  considered  that 
conviction  of  the  appellant  was  inevitable,  independently  of  the  identification 
evidence44.  The applicable principle is stated by Brennan J45: 
 

""… where, on the evidence and consistently with the directions of the trial 
judge, it is open to a jury to convict on any of two or more independent 
bases,  a  misdirection  or  an  inadequate  direction  which  would  vitiate  a 
conviction on one of those bases necessarily results in the setting aside of 
a  guilty  verdict  despite  the  availability  of  another  sound  basis  for 
conviction.    That  is  because  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  that  a  guilty 
verdict has been founded on a sound  basis when it was open to the jury to 
convict on a basis affected by the misdirection or inadequate direction.  A 
Court of Criminal Appeal cannot apply the proviso by speculating either 
that  the  jury  acted  on  a  body  of  evidence  which  was  unaffected  by  the 
misdirection or inadequate direction; nor can the Court speculate that, if 
the  jury  had  acted  on  such  evidence,  they  would  have  convicted.    If  a 
misdirection or inadequate direction would vitiate a conviction … and that 
basis of conviction was open to the jury, it is impossible to be satisfied 
that, by reason of the misdirection or inadequate direction, the accused did 
not lose a chance of acquittal."" 

Applying that approach to the present case, the establishment of two errors 
 
in the explanation of the ingredients of the offence of murder upon the basis of 
either  of  which  the  jury  might  have  reached  their  verdicts,  necessitates  the 
quashing  of  the  convictions  unless  it  can  be  said  that  the  verdicts  of  guilty  to 
murder  were  inevitable.    Is  that  a  conclusion  that  should  be  reached  in  this 
appeal? 
 
The appellants' forensic arguments:  In my opinion, it is not.  It is true that 
 
the  appellants  took  part  in  a  shocking  crime.    Their  proved  conduct  deserves 
condign punishment.  There were numerous charges, alternative to murder, upon

correctness of the approach to the proviso explained in this passage.

which they could have been presented for trial.  By choosing the  most serious 
charge of murder, the prosecution assumed a significant burden.  That choice also 
required an accurate trial. 
 
 
The  immediate  act  that  killed  the  deceased  was  that  of  Mr Escalante  in 
stabbing  him  and  puncturing  his  heart.    Neither  of  the  appellants  stabbed  the 
deceased.    Neither  of  them  personally  and  individually  carried  or  inserted  the 
knife that was the proximate cause of death.  Those acts  were done, and done 
only, by Mr Escalante.  At the beginning of the trial, Mr Escalante pleaded guilty 
to statutory murder, leaving the guilt of the appellants, relevantly of murder, to 
be determined by the jury.  Because the appellants did not themselves perform 
the act that led to the profound loss of blood in the chamber of the deceased's 
heart  occasioning  his  death,  their  guilt  of  murder  is  the  consequence  of  the 
application to their conduct of a legal fiction46.  In factual terms, they were guilty 
of attempted armed robbery and other offences.  However, their guilt of murder 
is the result either of a common law doctrine or of the statute so far as it provides 
for an expansion of the ordinary notion of murder and alters the requirements of 
that crime. 
 
 
In  saying  this,  I  do  not  minimise  the  conduct  of  the  appellants  by  their 
participation in the offences against Mr Hillam and the deceased, Mr Bourne.  I 
simply  draw  to  notice  that,  in  the  forensic  context,  the  appellants'  moral 
culpability for the death of the deceased was much less than that of Mr Escalante.  
Such considerations can sometimes weigh heavily in the deliberations of a jury.  
So might the appellants' respective ages.  It cannot therefore  be said that this was 
a trial where the appellants had no available forensic arguments. 
 
 
It is true that the entire events that culminated in Mr Escalante's stabbing 
of  the  deceased,  happened  in  a  matter  of  minutes.    But  that  is  not  unusual  in 
affrays of this kind.  The focus of the statute is upon the cause of death of the 
deceased.  The price of removing the necessity of establishing intent to cause that 
death  or  at  least  grievous  bodily  harm  is  the  obligation,  imposed  on  the 
prosecution by the Act, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that an identified 
intentional act of violence for which the accused is responsible caused that death.  
Only then is the accused rendered by law ""a person who … is guilty of murder"". 
 
 
It  is  true  that  each  of  the  appellants  had  a  personal  involvement  with  a 
knife  as  he  embarked  upon  his  criminal  conduct.    However,  again,  in  the 
evidentiary setting, both appellants were left with distinct arguments to advance 
before  the  jury.    The  possession  and  carrying  of  knives  is  reprehensible, 
dangerous and morally culpable, especially for those who take part in an armed 
robbery knowing that another participant has a knife.  But to secure a conviction

for  statutory  murder  it  remains  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  causal  link 
between the accused and the identified act of violence of someone else and the 
ensuing death by the use of a knife by that other person.  This Court should do 
nothing  to  enlarge  the  fiction  that  courts  and  scholars  have  pointed  out  is 
otherwise  inconsistent  with  the  fundamental  postulates  of  our  criminal  law, 
namely  liability  for  intentional  acts.    Certainly,  it  should  do  nothing  in  such  a 
case to  minimise the  burden cast on the prosecution by law to prove  each and 
every element of the offence in the case of each accused. 
 
Mr Arulthilakan had originally left his knife in the stolen car in which he 
 
was travelling with the other offenders.  His conduct in leaving his knife behind 
could  be  viewed  by  the  jury  as  a  positive  act,  somewhat  unusual  in  such 
circumstances,  to  distance  himself  from  the  use  of  knives  in  the  ensuing 
confrontation.  Whilst it is true that he agreed to Mr Mkoka's request to take the 
knife he had left in the car into the affray, his evidence was that he did so solely 
to  facilitate  the  robbery  not  for  use  in  stabbing  anyone.    On  the  basis  of  the 
evidence, Mr Arulthilakan had distinct evidentiary submissions to urge upon the 
jury relevant to his acquittal of murder. 
 
 
Similarly,  Mr Mkoka,  although  he  took  Mr Arulthilakan's  knife  into  the 
affray, dropped the knife on the road.  Arguably, this action was also capable of 
being viewed by the jury as distancing himself from the use of the knife in such a 
dangerous situation.  He gave evidence that he was aware that Mr Escalante was 
in  possession  of  a  knife  as  he  approached  the  victims  and  that  he  knew  that 
Mr Escalante carried a knife ""fairly often"".  However, Mr Mkoka asserted that he 
did not see the knife in Mr Escalante's hand when he dropped the knife he had 
taken and proceeded to use a cosh.  The cosh struck the deceased on his head.  
Whilst  the  actions  of  Mr Mkoka,  directed  at  a  stranger  are  shocking,  it  was 
common  ground  that  the  wounds  occasioned  by  the  cosh  did  not  themselves 
cause the deceased's death.  The cosh was an instrument used in the attempted 
armed robbery.  It follows that Mr Mkoka was also left with arguments to urge 
upon a jury that separated his actions from the cause of the deceased's death. 
 
 
to 
acknowledge the difficulty which, forensically, the prosecution faced in linking 
Mr Escalante's presentation of his knife to Mr Hillam and the act that caused the 
deceased's  death.    Trial  counsel  for  Mr Arulthilakan,  referring  to  the  identified 
""act of violence"", asked ""How, with respect, can it be said that the stabbing of 
Hillam  can  be  the  act  of  violence  causing  the  death  of  Bourne?    That  is 
untenable.""    To  this  remark,  the  trial  judge  said  ""I  agree"".    If  the  learned  trial 
judge agreed to this argument, it was clearly open to the jury to agree with it.   
 
 
The  presentation  of  Mr Escalante's  knife  to  Mr Hillam  occurred  on  the 
side of the road opposite that on which Mr Escalante later stabbed the deceased 
in the heart.  Whilst the events were closely interrelated and compressed into a 
matter of minutes, the causation issue remained a real question to be answered by

the jury.  It was a factual question.  It was one upon which the jury were obliged 
to  deliberate.    On  the  facts  it  was  not  inevitable  that  a  jury  would  convict  the 
appellants.    It  was  open  to  a  properly  instructed  jury,  on  the  evidence,  to 
conclude that the appellants were involved (including in the case of Mr Mkoka 
with his cosh) solely in the attempted armed robbery.  It was open to the jury to 
decide that the significant cause, and the sole substantial cause, of the death of 
the  deceased  (and  thus  the  legal  cause  contemplated  by  the  Act)  was  the 
independent act of Mr Escalante alone (a man revealed by the evidence to have 
been highly agitated, excitable and apparently violent).  If the jury so decided it 
was  open  to  them  to  conclude  that  the  appellants  were  not  guilty  of  statutory 
murder.  This would have consigned the prosecution to establishing the requisite 
intention necessary to secure a conviction of each appellant of murder at common 
law.    The  same  evidentiary  considerations  were  available  to  each  of  the 
appellants on this score.  Guilt of causation of murder was not inevitable.   
 
Conclusion:  a new trial:  This analysis made the trial judge's instructions 
 
to  the  jury  on  the  elements  of  statutory  murder  important,  and  potentially 
decisive.  In the event, the two errors of law in the directions on this point were 
crucial.    Once  the  judge  had  informed  the  jury  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the 
introduction  by  Mr Escalante  of  the  knife  for  the  purpose  of  threatening, 
intimidating or stabbing Mr Hillam was the relevant ""intentional act of violence"", 
this  effectively  confined  the  jury's  role,  in  respect  of  statutory  murder,  to 
deciding the causation issue.  But in the context, if the jury concluded that the 
involvement  of  the  appellants  was  solely  in  relation  to  the  attempted  armed 
robbery, their verdict, as a matter of fact, on the ""intentional act of violence"" for 
which  the  appellants  were  responsible,  was  vital  in  reaching  their  verdict  on 
statutory murder.   
 
 
Even more importantly, the ""but for"" direction given by the trial judge on 
the issue of causation confined even more narrowly the remaining issue that the 
jury then had to decide.  On the basis of that direction, it was a very small step 
for the jury to conclude that the event involving Mr Escalante and Mr Hillam was 
closely connected to Mr Escalante's stabbing of the deceased so soon afterwards.  
Each involved Mr Escalante.  Each involved his knife.  The direction therefore 
diverted  the  jury  from  deciding  the  question  of  causation  presented  by  the 
definition  of  statutory  murder  contained  in  the  Act.    Properly  explained,  this 
would have required the jury to decide whether the presentation by Mr Escalante 
of his knife to Mr Hillam was the cause of the subsequent death of the deceased 
or, at least, a significant contributing cause of that death for which the appellants 
were liable47.  In law it was not enough that it was simply one event in the chain 
of events that unfolded.  Defining it in such a way made it virtually impossible 
for the appellants to escape a guilty verdict of statutory murder.

Conclusion and orders 
 
 
The  appellants  are  entitled  to  raise  the  points  they  have  argued  in  this 
Court.    Misdirections  of  law  have  been  established,  as  is  now  accepted  by  the 
entire Court.  The misdirection on causation was specially significant in this case.  
This Court cannot know whether the foundation of the jury's verdicts of guilty of 
murder  was  based  on  statutory  murder  or  common  law  murder.    In  the 
circumstances, the only basis upon which the misdirections may be excused is if 
the respondent establishes that the convictions of the appellants were inevitable.  
The  evidence  demonstrates  that  the  appellants  had  real  factual  arguments  to 
present to the jury.  It was essential, therefore, that the elements of the offence of 
statutory murder be accurately explained to the jury.  They were not.  In the light 
of the factual arguments, it cannot be said that the convictions of the appellants 
were inevitable.  Accordingly, the ""proviso"" does not apply. 
 
The  appeals  should  be  allowed.    The  orders  of  the  Court  of  Criminal 
 
Appeal of South Australia in respect of each of the appellants should be set aside.  
In lieu thereof, it should be ordered that the appellants' appeals to that Court be 
allowed; their convictions quashed;  and a new trial ordered.",2003-12-10 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

 Chao Hick Tin JA:
Introduction
1       This appeal is set in the context of the sentencing of an offender who engages with other persons (“co-offenders”) in a common criminal enterprise. Should the Public Prosecutor, the respondent in this appeal (“the Respondent”), be under a duty in such a situation to disclose to the court relevant material pertaining to the sentences received by the co-offenders? When and how should the parity principle, which entails that the offenders who participate in a common criminal enterprise should, generally speaking, receive the same sentence, be applied in this context? These questions form the crux of the present appeal, which concerns the sentences imposed by a district judge (“the Sentencing Judge”) on the appellant, Karen Lim Bee Ngan (“the Appellant”), in relation to offences under the Betting Act (Cap 21, 2011 Rev Ed) (“the BA”) and the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CGHA”). The Appellant contends that the aggregate sentence which the Sentencing Judge imposed on her – 
viz
, ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of $141,000 (in default, 22 weeks’ imprisonment) – is inappropriate or manifestly excessive. Her challenge relates only to the imprisonment term. The Sentencing Judge’s written grounds of decision may be found at 
Public Prosecutor v Karen Lim Bee Ngan
 
[2014] SGMC 14
 (“the GD”).
The factual background
2       On 28 June 2012 at about 4.30pm, Senior Station Inspector Leong Shee Chun and a party of police officers raided 92 Flora Road, #05-41, Edelweiss Condominium on suspicion that offences under the BA and the CGHA were being or had been committed there.
[note: 1]
 Following the raid, the Appellant was taken to the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) for further questioning. While at the CID, she logged on to her online football and 4D betting accounts and printed out some betting records (“the Exhibits”) from www.st999.net.com, www.galaxy188.com and agt.ibc88.com.
[note: 2]
3       Investigations revealed that the Exhibits related to the Appellant’s illegal 4D betting, 4D bet collection and football bookmaking activities. In early 2010, the Appellant had obtained an online football “Master Agent” account from her brother, Lim Chin-U Keith (“Keith”), and used it to collect football bets. That account, which the Appellant accessed via the website agt.ibc88.com, came with a $1.1m credit limit. Investigations revealed that the Appellant collected football bets from her customers and placed their respective bets into the account. She earned a commission of 20% to 90% of the value of the bets collected whenever her customers lost money on their bets, and settled the bets with Keith using cash.
[note: 3]
 It was not clear from the Statement of Facts exactly how much the Appellant earned from the commission received from these bets.
4       Further investigations revealed that the Appellant had also obtained an online 4D betting account from Keith via the website www.st999.net.com, and used it to purchase and place illegal 4D bets. That account came with a credit limit of $12,000, and the Appellant likewise settled the 4D bets with Keith using cash.
[note: 4]
 Separately, the Appellant obtained another online 4D account from “Ah Tee”, one Ng Leong Chuan, via the website www.galaxy188.com. The Appellant used this account, which came with a credit limit of $35,000, to collect illegal 4D bets and settled the bets with Ah Tee using cash. She was given a commission of 7% of the value of the bets collected, and an additional 5% when her punters struck 4D bets.
[note: 5]
The charges against the Appellant
The charges proceeded with by the Respondent
5       Of the 15 charges brought against the Appellant in total, five charges were proceeded with by the Respondent. I shall refer to each of these five charges as a “Proceeded Charge” so as to distinguish them from the remaining ten charges which were taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.
The facts relating to the first Proceeded Charge
6       Investigations into the first Proceeded Charge, Magistrate’s Arrest Case (“MAC”) No 9876 of 2013 (“the First Proceeded Charge”), revealed that the printouts from www.st999.net.com related to the Appellant’s illegal “10,000 (4D) characters” lottery betting activities. The betting records showed that the Appellant had received stakes of the following values from punters:
(a)     42 “Big” tickets valued at a total of $67.20; and
(b)     108 “Small” tickets valued at a total of $75.60.
7       The bets, which were calculated based on a rate of $1.60 per “Big” ticket and $0.70 per “Small” ticket, were placed against the results of the Singapore Pools 4D Game draw held on 23 June 2012.
[note: 6]
 The Appellant was charged under s 9(1) of the CGHA in relation to these bets.
The facts relating to the second Proceeded Charge
8       Investigations into the second Proceeded Charge, MAC No 9878 of 2013 (“the Second Proceeded Charge”), revealed that the printouts from www.galaxy188.com related to the Appellant’s illegal 4D bet collection activities. Those records showed that the Appellant had received bets of the following values from punters:
(a)     200 “Big” tickets valued at a total of $320; and
(b)     200 “Small” tickets valued at a total of $140.
9       The bets, which were likewise calculated based on a rate of $1.60 per “Big” ticket and $0.70 per “Small” ticket, were placed against the results of the Singapore Pools 4D Game draw held on 24 June 2012.
[note: 7]
 The Appellant was charged under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA in relation to these bets.
The facts relating to the third Proceeded Charge
10     Investigations into the third Proceeded Charge, MAC No 9881 of 2013 (“the Third Proceeded Charge”), revealed that the printouts from the Appellant’s online football account related to her illegal football bookmaking activities whereby she accepted bets totalling $21,580 to forecast the results of football matches for fixtures held on 16 June 2012 in the following leagues:
(a)     UEFA Euro 2012;
(b)     Japan J-League Division 1;
(c)     Australia Victoria Premier League;
(d)     Western Australia State League Premier;
(e)     Australia Brisbane Premier League;
(f)     USA Major League Soccer;
(g)     Japan J-League Division 2; and
(h)     Japan Football League.
11     According to para 9 of the Statement of Facts, in relation to the above bets, the Appellant earned “a commission of 20% to 90% from the total bet value collected”. I note that this is not entirely consistent with the description at [3] above of the commission payable to the Appellant, but it is what is set out in the Statement of Facts; the same applies to the description at [13] and [15] below of the commission payable to the Appellant. The Appellant was charged under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA in relation to the above bets.
The facts relating to the fourth Proceeded Charge
12     Investigations into the fourth Proceeded Charge, MAC No 9883 of 2013 (“the Fourth Proceeded Charge”), revealed that the printouts from the Appellant’s online football account related to her illegal football bookmaking activities whereby she accepted bets totalling $16,450 to forecast the results of football matches for fixtures held on 18 June 2012 in the following leagues:
(a)     UEFA Euro 2012;
(b)     AFC U22 Asian Cup Qualifiers;
(c)     Women Volvo Winners’ Cup;
(d)     International Friendly; and
(e)     Finland Veikkausliiga.
13     In relation to the above bets, the Appellant similarly earned a commission of 20% to 90% of the total value of the bets collected. On the foregoing facts, she was charged under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA.
The facts relating to the fifth Proceeded Charge
14     Investigations into the fifth Proceeded Charge, MAC No 9886 of 2013 (“the Fifth Proceeded Charge”), revealed that the printouts from the Appellant’s online football account related to her illegal football bookmaking activities whereby she accepted bets totalling $22,500 to forecast the results of football matches for fixtures held on 21 June 2012 in the following leagues:
(a)     UEFA Euro 2012;
(b)     Indonesia Super Liga; and
(c)     Copa Libertadores.
15     The Appellant likewise earned a commission of 20% to 90% of the total value of the bets collected 
vis-à-vis
 the above bets. On the foregoing facts, she was charged under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA.
The charges taken into consideration
16     As mentioned earlier, ten charges (“TIC Charges”) were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Of these ten charges, one was brought under s 9(1) of the CGHA, one was brought under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA and the remaining eight were brought under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA. The bets involved in the eight TIC Charges brought under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA, together with the bets that were the subject of the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges (which were likewise brought under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA), amounted to $133,045 in total (see the GD at [23]).
The decision below
The individual sentences imposed by the Sentencing Judge
17     The individual sentences imposed on the Appellant by the Sentencing Judge in respect of the Proceeded Charges were as follows:
(a)     For the First Proceeded Charge, the Appellant was sentenced to a fine of $1,000 (in default, one week’s imprisonment) (see the GD at [7]).
(b)     For the Second Proceeded Charge, the Appellant was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 (in default, three weeks’ imprisonment) (see the GD at [9]). In imposing this punishment, the Sentencing Judge adopted the approach taken in 
Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 165
 (“
Lim Li Ling
”), where Tay Yong Kwang J held (at [91]) that sentencing courts “should continue their current practice of imposing both a fine and imprisonment” [emphasis in original omitted] for offences under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA so as to “adequately deter and punish those who engage in illegal lotteries”.
(c)     For the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges, the Appellant was sentenced in respect of each of these charges to five months’ imprisonment and a fine of $40,000 (in default, six weeks’ imprisonment) (see the GD at [11]). The Sentencing Judge noted that although 
Lim Li Ling
 involved an offence under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA, the same reasoning had been applied to offences under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA, such that both a fine and an imprisonment term were typically imposed for the latter. Public interest, the Sentencing Judge stated (at [10] of the GD), warranted punishing illegal bookmakers in a similar vein as those who assisted in the carrying on of public lotteries and ran afoul of the CGHA.
The aggregate sentence imposed
18     As s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) mandated that at least two of the Appellant’s imprisonment sentences had to run consecutively, the Sentencing Judge ordered the imprisonment sentences for the Third and the Fifth Proceeded Charges to run consecutively (see the GD at [14] and [28]). The Appellant was thus punished with an aggregate sentence of ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of $141,000 (in default, 22 weeks’ imprisonment) (see the GD at [15]).
19     In arriving at the aggregate sentence, the Sentencing Judge took into account the following as aggravating factors: (a) the Appellant had been involved in illegal betting activities over the Internet since early June 2010; and (b) the sums involved as well as the gains made by the Appellant were substantial (see the GD at [13] and [19]). The Sentencing Judge also noted that offences committed over the Internet were not only difficult to detect, but also on the rise. As such, he took the view (at [28] of the GD) that “severe sentences had to be meted out as clear signals that such misconduct was not to be tolerated”.
20     At the same time, the Sentencing Judge carefully considered the Appellant’s mitigation plea, noting her “personal circumstances and her medical and mental issues, and the various difficulties that she had faced and was continuing to face” (see the GD at [17]). He held, however, that on balance, the aggravating factors “far outweighed the mitigating effects [which the Appellant’s] personal circumstances brought to the fore” (see, likewise, [17] of the GD), so much so that there were “strong reasons” for at least three of the Appellant’s imprisonment terms to run consecutively (see [29] of the GD; see also [13] of the GD).
21     Ultimately, bearing in mind the totality principle of sentencing and taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the Sentencing Judge held that it was sufficient to order only two of the Appellant’s imprisonment sentences (namely, the imprisonment sentences for the Third and the Fifth Proceeded Charges) to run consecutively, and exercised his discretion accordingly (see the GD at [13]–[14] and [28]–[29]). He also scaled down the default imprisonment sentences for the fines meted out so as not to impose too “crushing” an aggregate sentence on the Appellant (see the GD at [29]). Dissatisfied, the Appellant has appealed.
The parties’ submissions on appeal
22     Before me, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Chan Tai-Hui Jason (“Mr Chan”), submitted that:
(a)     The Respondent failed to place before the Sentencing Judge relevant material pertaining to two persons mentioned in the Statement of Facts as being involved in the Appellant’s illegal 4D betting and football bookmaking activities, namely, Keith and Ah Tee. The Statement of Facts merely stated that those two persons had been “dealt with”. Nothing more, particularly the sentences imposed on them, was tendered to the Sentencing Judge when the Appellant was sentenced, even though the Respondent, as the prosecuting authority, was under a duty to do so according to 
Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 3 SLR 1205
 (“
Kadar (No 1)
”) and 
Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] 4 SLR 791
 (“
Kadar (No 2)
”) in order to ensure a fair trial and avoid a miscarriage of justice.
[note: 8]
(b)     As the Respondent failed to provide the Sentencing Judge with relevant material pertaining to Keith’s and Ah Tee’s sentences, the Sentencing Judge was unable to consider and apply the parity principle, which should have been applied.
[note: 9]
 Consequently, a miscarriage of justice resulted as there was now a lack of parity between the aggregate sentence imposed on the Appellant and the aggregate sentences imposed on Keith and Ah Tee, which would cause a right-thinking member of the public with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances to consider that something had gone amiss with the administration of justice. It was, Mr Chan submitted, the duty of this court, in its appellate capacity, to correct this miscarriage of justice.
(c)     Alternatively, Mr Chan contended, the Appellant’s aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive, bearing in mind: (i) the sentencing precedents for identical or similar offences; (ii) the Sentencing Judge’s erroneous consideration of aggravating factors that he should not have taken into account; and (iii) the Sentencing Judge’s failure to properly consider the Appellant’s mitigating circumstances.
23     In rebuttal, the Respondent, through Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang Suet Fern (“Ms Phang”), submitted that:
(a)     It was trite that the threshold for appellate intervention would only be met if there was a need for a substantial alteration to the sentence being challenged, as opposed to an insignificant correction.
[note: 10]
(b)     The Sentencing Judge had correctly given “sufficient weight to the need for general deterrence as the predominant sentencing consideration where gaming offences involv[ed] the use of technology to evade detection”.
[note: 11]
 In meting out the punishment which he imposed, Ms Phang argued, the Sentencing Judge had also correctly considered the following as aggravating factors:
[note: 12]
(i)       the Appellant’s “intense” criminal conduct, as shown by the fact that her illegal gambling business had lasted for some three years;
(ii)       the large amount of bets which had been placed with the Appellant; and
(iii)       the large sums of commission which the Appellant had received from the illegal enterprise.
(c)     The mitigating factors had been properly considered and balanced against the aggravating factors by the Sentencing Judge, and the sentence imposed on the Appellant was in fact “on the lenient side”.
[note: 13]
(d)     Even if the Sentencing Judge had been informed of the sentences imposed on Keith and Ah Tee and had taken those sentences into account, he would still have arrived at the same conclusion where the Appellant was concerned.
[note: 14]
24     It clearly emerges from the written and oral submissions of the parties that the main issue in this appeal centres on the operation of the parity principle 
vis-à-vis
 the sentencing of offenders who engage in a common criminal enterprise, and whether the Sentencing Judge erred by failing to consider this principle when sentencing the Appellant. In this connection, I shall also address the question of the Prosecution’s duty to assist the court in respect of sentencing.
An appellate court’s powers of review 
25     I first set out the trite law on an appellate court’s powers of review over sentences imposed by lower courts. In 
ADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal
 
[2010] 1 SLR 874
, the Court of Appeal held at [17] that the sentence imposed by a trial court would not ordinarily be disturbed by an appellate court unless:
(a)     the trial court erred with regard to the proper factual basis for sentencing;
(b)     the trial court failed to appreciate the materials placed before it;
(c)     the sentence was wrong in principle; or
(d)     the sentence was manifestly excessive or inadequate, in that there was a need for a 
substantial alteration
 to the sentence, as opposed to an insignificant correction, to remedy the injustice.
26     I now turn to address the key issue of parity, upon which considerable importance has been placed by the Appellant.
When is the parity principle applicable?
Divergent approaches to the parity principle
27     The parity principle, as stated by this court in 
Public Prosecutor v Ramlee and another action
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 95
 (“
Ramlee
”) at [7], entails that:
Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances …
28     How widely should the parity principle apply? This has been the subject of disagreement, and Australian judges have diverged on this very issue. In 
Lowe v R
 (1984) 54 ALR 193 (“
Lowe
”) at 194, Gibbs CJ took the view (referred to hereafter as “the Narrow View”) that the parity principle applied only to co-offenders in the sense of “persons who [had] been parties to the commission of 
the same offence
” [emphasis added]. This view was subsequently echoed in (
inter alia
) 
Postiglione v The Queen
 (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 325 by Gummow J. In contrast, in 
Jimmy v R
 (2010) 269 ALR 115 (“
Jimmy
”) at [199], the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (“the NSWCCA”) took the broader view (“the Broad View”) that the parity principle could be applied between persons who “participate[d] in a common criminal enterprise 
even if they [did] not all commit the self-same crime
” [emphasis added].
The Narrow View
29     The Narrow View of the parity principle was initially preferred in Australia, as can be seen from (
inter alia
) the decision in 
Lowe
. However, subsequent cases saw a gradual widening of the principle’s application. In 
Sumner v R
 (1985) 19 A Crim R 210 (“
Sumner
”), for instance, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal applied the parity principle in a case where a common criminal enterprise, that of handling a consignment of stolen cigarettes, was carried out by a few men who handled the consignment at different times and played significantly different roles in the criminal enterprise. 
Sumner
 was cited by the NSWCCA in 
Jimmy
 (at [77]) as an example of the parity principle being applied in a case where the co-offenders did not all commit the same crime, but were nonetheless involved in the same criminal enterprise.
30     The widening of the Narrow View can also be seen from Chief Justice Wayne Martin AC’s address at the Sentencing Conference 2014, where he stated (see Wayne Martin, “The Art of Sentencing – an appellate court perspective” (9 October 2014) <http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/_files/The%20Art%20of%20Sentencing%20-%20an%20Appellate%20Court%20Perspective%20Martin%20CJ%2014%20Oct%202014.pdf> (accessed 14 July 2015) at pp 10–11):
The parity principle is an aspect of the broader principle of equal justice. Like the totality principle, it has two components:
Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant aspect.
The parity principle is often expressed in terms of the disparity giving rise to an objectively justifiable or legitimate sense of grievance on the part of the offender invoking the principle, or an appearance that justice has not been done.
The parity principle is to be distinguished from the general objective of consistency in sentencing, which applies to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events. In this context, consistency does not mean numerical or mathematical equivalence, but consistency in the application of relevant legal principles. However, 
the parity principle applies only to the punishment of those engaged in the commission of the same offence
, 
or in related offences arising from one transaction in which they were engaged
. As already noted, the principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders in order to reflect differing degrees of culpability or differing personal circumstances, but requires that the sentences imposed bear an appropriate relationship to each other, after taking account of those differences
.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
31     The issue of whether the parity principle should be applied in cases where the offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise are charged with different offences arose in 
R v Gibson
 (1991) 56 A Crim R 1 (“
Gibson
”). In that case, the offenders concerned were charged with different offences which attracted very different maximum penalties. The NSWCCA declined to apply the parity principle on the grounds that it would, in practical terms, be difficult to apply, and furthermore, applying it would “[stretch] the search for parity to unacceptable limits” (at [8]). In 
Jimmy
 at [82], the NSWCCA commented on the decision in 
Gibson
 as follows:
… Carruthers J did not say that parity would in principle be inapplicable between the people charged with supplying and those charged with possession, nor that it would be inapplicable between the people charged with supplying as those charges related to different acts of supplying. Rather, the difficulty in taking into account all the differences between the factors that had [led] to the differing sentences defeated, 
at a practical level
, any attempt to apply the principle. [emphasis added]
The Broad View
32     The Broad View applies the parity principle in a wider context. It is reflected in (
inter alia
) Kow Keng Siong, 
Sentencing Principles in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2009) at para 13.027, where the author states that the parity principle should be used as a 
practical starting point
 in sentencing 
offenders who are part of a common criminal enterprise
, with appropriate adjustments being made from that starting point to account for offender-specific circumstances.
33     At this juncture, I should highlight the case of 
R v Kerr
 [2003] NSWCCA 234 (“
Kerr
”), where the NSWCCA seemed to apply the Broad View of the parity principle very liberally. In 
Kerr
, three offenders were involved in a robbery, pursuant to which the applicant was convicted of aggravated robbery after a trial. His accomplices, one Oliver and one Tickner, were charged with and convicted of, respectively, robbery 
simpliciter
 and concealing a serious indictable offence. The sentencing judge, who did not think the parity principle was applicable (see 
Kerr
 at [12]), sentenced the applicant to 13 years and six months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of ten years and six months (at [5]). Oliver, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 500 hours of community service (at [10]), while Tickner was given an 18-month suspended sentence (at [11]). On appeal to the NSWCCA, Miles AJ held that: (a) the policy behind the parity principle could not be avoided simply by the Prosecution charging cooperative offenders with less serious offences; and (b) the lighter charge of robbery 
simpliciter
 against Oliver appeared to be due to his cooperation with the authorities, rather than his actual degree of participation in the criminal enterprise. Applying the parity principle, Miles AJ reduced the applicant’s sentence to imprisonment of ten years, with a non-parole period of seven and a half years (at [31]). Miles AJ reasoned that the parity principle should be applied as (at [19]):
It is established that disparity so called can arise when a co-offender is sentenced after the aggrieved offender has been sentenced … In such cases there can be no error on the part of the judge sentencing the offender later aggrieved … It is also recognised that 
the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied or withheld in a technical or pedantic way
. It is indeed part of or a reflection of the wider principle that consistency in sentencing by the courts overall is to be aimed at as desirable in the public interest. 
Perfect consistency is a goal that can never be reached because of the infinite variety of the circumstances of offences or offenders. However there is a danger that [the principle of consistency] may be compromised by the selection of differing charges so that one offender may be charged with a serious offence and given punishment at the top of an acceptable range for that offence, and a co-offender charged with another less serious offence and dealt with at the very bottom of the acceptable range for that other offence.
 There may be no impropriety in that course, which will often arise from negotiation between co-offenders and law enforcement authorities. Sometimes, however, … the result may have the appearance of injustice. [emphasis added]
34      
Kerr
 is a controversial decision as it seems to advocate the application of the parity principle as a basis for reducing the sentence imposed on an offender if it is disproportionate to the sentence imposed on a co-offender who engaged in the same criminal enterprise but who was 
charged with a different offence
, so much so that the courts can correct sentencing disparities created as a result of the Prosecution exercising its discretion to bring different charges against different co-offenders.
35     The backlash against 
Kerr
 was fast and furious. In 
R v Formosa
 [2005] NSWCCA 363 (“
Formosa
”), the NSWCCA looked upon 
Kerr
 unfavourably. Simpson J stated (at [40]) that while 
Kerr
 could be read as extending the parity principle to situations where co-offenders were charged with different offences and while it was 
possible
 for the principle to be applied in such a manner, the extreme divergence in the nature of crimes committed in 
Formosa
 meant that the parity principle could not be practically applied as it was difficult to do so.
36      
Kerr
 was also criticised in 
Jimmy
 at [124]–[130], where Campbell JA commented:
124    … At a level of broad policy, the law in sentencing aims to treat like cases alike, and unlike cases differently. But the policy underlying the law is not the same as the law itself. There are practical difficulties in carrying that policy into effect. One of no small significance is that sometimes there will be occasions when an offender is charged with a lesser crime than would have been justified if all the relevant facts had been discovered by the police, or than would have been justified if the police had admissible evidence, rather than information that does not meet the standards of admissibility. There is always, in one sense, unfairness if one person receives a heavier sentence than a person who if all the facts were known could be seen to be equally culpable but against whom the truth of what actually occurred cannot be proved by admissible evidence. A sentencing judge will usually not be in a position to know whether the reason for one person involved in a criminal enterprise being charged with a lesser offence than another is lack of evidence, rather than that the facts if fully known justified the difference in the charges. …
125    There are other limitations on a judge being able to compare directly the sentences of people charged with different offences. There will be occasions when one person involved in a criminal enterprise is charged with a lesser offence than another in what might be called a comparatively clear exercise of prosecutor’s discretion. Such an occasion arises when, even though on the available admissible evidence it would have been open to charge the first of those people with a more serious offence than was actually charged, the prosecutor decided not to do so, perhaps as part of a plea bargain, perhaps as a trade-off for the person charged providing assistance, perhaps because of matters personal to that person like youth, perhaps for other reasons. There will be other occasions when one person involved in the criminal enterprise is charged with a lesser offence than another in circumstances where the available admissible evidence is such that even the most assiduous prosecutor could not realistically have expected to prove a more serious offence against the first of those people. There will be other occasions that have some elements of both of these factual scenarios. It will often be impossible for a judge to know whether the charging of two people with different offences is truly, or wholly, a matter of discretion on the part of the prosecutor. In comparing the sentences of co-offenders courts are well able to factor out the effect on the sentences of differences that the court knows about in the objective circumstances of involvement of the respective co-offenders in the crime, and in the subjective circumstances of the offenders. But 
it would not be practicable for a court to try to apply an extended version of the parity principle by comparing the sentences of two people in the common enterprise 
and factoring out the extent to which the difference in the sentences is a function of prosecutorial discretion
. It cannot carry out that task when it does not know to what extent it is truly a discretion, rather than something else, that is the reason for the difference in the charges. In the result, to the extent to which differences in sentence arise from 
differences in the charges 
brought against two people involved in the one common criminal enterprise, those differences 
cannot 
be corrected … by an application of the parity principle.
…
130    I am persuaded, for the reasons I have given, that Kerr 
was mistaken in extending the parity principle to apply to undo the extent to which differences in the sentences of people involved in a common criminal enterprise, but who are charged with different offences, arose from the charges being different. Kerr
 did not rest upon any principle carefully worked out in a series of cases – indeed it ignored the earlier and contrary decision in [
R v Howard
 (1992) 29 NSWLR 242]. While there was no disagreement between the judges who decided 
Kerr
, it has not been relied on in a series of cases thereafter. Rather, it has been the subject of repeated criticism that has not gone quite as far as actually deciding it is wrong. 
I would not follow the aspect of it that permitted the parity principle to undo the effect on sentence of different charges being brought against two participants in a common criminal enterprise
.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
37     Bell J’s criticism of 
Kerr
 in his minority judgment in 
Green v R
 (2011) 283 ALR 1 (“
Green
”) should also be noted. Bell J stated at [122]–[123]:
122    The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal was correct in 
Jimmy
 to hold that 
Kerr
 was wrongly decided. As Campbell JA observed, the parity principle is not applied to correct differences in the sentences imposed on offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise who are convicted of different offences. The selection of the charges upon which offenders are brought before the court is a matter for the prosecuting authority. 
The justifiable sense of grievance which informs the parity principle arises from the manifest disparity in the sentences imposed by the court on offenders convicted of the same offences. As Simpson J explained in
 Formosa
, where the discrepancy in sentences derives from 
the differences in charges between offenders
, any sense of grievance is engendered in consequence of a prosecutorial decision and is not a grievance in the
 Lowe 
or
 Postiglione [see 
Postiglione v The Queen
 (1997) 189 CLR 295, cited earlier at [28] above] 
sense.
123    In 
Postiglione
, Gummow J said that the parity principle only applies to co-offenders. As explained above, since the issue was not raised in 
Postiglione
, his Honour’s statement may not have been intended to exclude persons who are not co-offenders in the strict sense. However, the extension of a principle concerned with the equality of treatment to offenders charged with different offences raises distinct difficulties. In 
Jimmy
, the court said that significant limitations attend to the application of the principle in such a case. These limitations included the “particular difficulties” attending a disparity argument that is based on comparison with an offender convicted of a less serious offence. Howie J’s statement [in 
Jimmy
 at [245]] that the principle should not be confined to a consideration of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders in the strict sense was subject to his agreement with the significant limitations identified by Campbell JA.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
38     The criticisms of 
Kerr
 may seem to suggest that the parity principle should 
never
 be extended to cases where the offenders engaged in a common criminal enterprise are charged with different offences. As I see it, the criticisms expressed in 
Formosa
, 
Jimmy
 and Bell J’s minority judgment in 
Green
 (set out 
in extenso
 above) reveal that the main objection to applying the parity principle in such cases revolves around the use of the principle to correct sentencing disparities caused by the 
exercise of prosecutorial discretion
 to charge different co-offenders differently. This same concern is reflected in 
Phua Song Hua v Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] SGHC 33
 (“
Phua Song Hua
”) at [38], where Yong Pung How CJ declined to apply the parity principle in an appeal against (
inter alia
) sentence as the appellant, who claimed trial, had been charged with a more serious offence carrying a maximum imprisonment term of five years than his co-offenders, who had pleaded guilty to a less serious offence carrying a much shorter maximum imprisonment term of six months, such that “there [was] no longer any common basis for comparison”. To that extent, I agree with the criticisms of 
Kerr
; but that is 
not
 to say that where the offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise are charged with different offences, the parity principle can never be applied. Much will depend on why different charges were brought against different co-offenders even though they were all engaged in a common criminal enterprise.
39     Indeed, the NSWCCA in 
Formosa
 and 
Jimmy
, and likewise, Bell J in his minority judgment in 
Green
, did not totally reject the notion that the parity principle could, in appropriate situations, apply where the offenders acting pursuant to a common criminal enterprise were charged with different offences. Where 
Formosa
 is concerned, all that it makes clear is that the parity principle should not be used to redress a situation where the 
main
 reason for the discrepancy between the sentences of different co-offenders lies in the different charges which they faced (at [50]). With regard to 
Jimmy
, the NSWCCA in that case, despite criticising 
Kerr
, also stated the Broad View that the parity principle could “within limits, … have a role to play in comparison of sentences for 
different crimes
 committed by people involved in a common criminal enterprise” [emphasis added] (at [136] 
per
 Campbell JA; see also Campbell JA’s comment at [199] of 
Jimmy
, which I referred to earlier at [28] above). I also draw attention to Howie J’s judgment in 
Jimmy
, where he stated at [245] and [247]:
245     
The principle of parity should 
 
not 
 
be confined to a consideration of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders in the strict sense, that is persons involved in and charged with 
 
the very same crime
 
.
 There is nothing in the decisions of the High Court [of Australia] that so confine it. 
Where the courts have stated that the principle of parity applies only to co-offenders, it has usually been in situations where the applicant has sought to use the principle for an illegitimate purpose by seeking to compare the sentence imposed upon the applicant with a sentence imposed upon another offender who was not engaged in the offence committed by the applicant.
…
247    In particular I agree, for the reasons given by [Campbell JA], that 
R v Kerr
 [2003] NSWCCA 234 should no longer be followed in so far as the proposition for which it is generally cited [is concerned]. 
It is not the business of the courts to try to ameliorate the effects of prosecutorial decisions in charging, or not charging, persons involved in a criminal enterprise.
 The facts of 
Kerr
 do not, in my respectful opinion, justify the decision taken and this Court has not since 
Kerr
 was decided found or been able to envisage a situation in which a court would be justified in taking into account the effects of prosecutorial discretion when exercising the sentencing discretion. I have been concerned at the number of times that 
Kerr
 has been relied upon in this Court, at least when I have been a member of it, without any reference being made to the decisions that have raised doubts about its correctness.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
As for Bell J’s criticisms of 
Kerr
 in his minority judgment in 
Green
 at [122]–[123] (see [37] above), his main concern was that extending the parity principle to a factual situation akin to that in 
Kerr
 could result in the courts “curing” disproportionate sentences arising from the Prosecution’s decision to bring different charges against different co-offenders, as opposed to extending the application of the parity principle in appropriate situations.
40     I return to Miles AJ’s concern in 
Kerr
 that in a case involving co-offenders, the principle of consistency in sentencing might be compromised by the Prosecution’s charging decisions in respect of different co-offenders. This concern is apparent from his remark at [19] (also reproduced earlier at [33] above) that:
… [T]here is a danger that [the principle of consistency] may be compromised by the selection of differing charges so that one offender may be charged with a serious offence and given punishment at the top of an acceptable range for that offence, and a co-offender charged with another less serious offence and dealt with at the very bottom of the acceptable range for that other offence. …
41     With respect, it seems to me that Miles AJ may have put his concern too widely, given the myriad of factors which may lead to different participants in a common criminal enterprise being charged with different offences (see Campbell JA’s comments in 
Jimmy
 at [124]–[125], which I quoted earlier at [36] above). The parity principle should not be used to correct sentences which are disproportionate as a result of charging decisions made by the Prosecution. That said, it could be artificial for the court to limit the application of the parity principle only to situations where the offenders who engage in a common criminal enterprise are charged with the same offence, as held in 
Lowe
; form should not override substance. I would imagine that in an appropriate case, where the facts warrant it, the parity principle could well apply where the offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise are charged with different offences – 
subject
, however, to the limitations alluded to by Campbell JA in 
Jimmy
 at [203]:
… At least some of the limits on the use of the parity principle in such a case are:
(1)    It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them …
(2)    If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties. Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy …
(3)    It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low …
(4)    There are particular difficulties in an appellant succeeding in a disparity argument where the disparity is said to arise by comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the applicant. …
42     With regard to the third limitation mentioned by Campbell JA, I should add that this limitation ought not to be applied rigidly. Where there is clearly a well-established body of sentencing precedents and the sentence imposed on an offender is unduly lenient as compared with those precedents, a later court, when sentencing a co-offender, 
need not
 necessarily punish the co-offender in a similarly lenient fashion 
provided
 there is an acceptable explanation as to why the Prosecution did not appeal against the earlier lenient sentence. If, however, there is no such acceptable explanation, the parity principle would 
prima facie
 require the later sentencing court to follow suit and impose a lenient sentence on the co-offender, lest members of the public who have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the case think that something has gone awry with the administration of justice where the co-offender’s sentence is concerned. Indeed, in the early Singapore case of 
Liow Eng Giap v Public Prosecutor
 
[1968–1970] SLR(R) 681
 (“
Liow Eng Giap
”), Choor Singh J revised the sentence of the appellant downwards in view of the light sentence imposed on his co-offender, who had been charged with the same offence as the appellant. That said, it seems to me that if the inadequacy of the earlier-sentenced offender’s punishment is “so marked that it amounts to ‘an affront to the administration of justice’ which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system” (see the majority judgment in 
Green
 at [42]), then even if there is no acceptable explanation as to why the Prosecution did not appeal against that earlier sentence, it may – depending on all the facts and circumstances of the case – be appropriate for the later sentencing court 
not
 to sentence the co-offender in a similarly lenient manner.
My view on the two divergent approaches
43     As between the two divergent approaches to the parity principle outlined above, it is my opinion that the Broad View (as advanced in, 
inter alia
, 
Jimmy
) is logical and makes good sense, and is to be preferred over the Narrow View (as advanced in, 
inter alia
, 
Lowe
). The Narrow View is simply too rigid and could unfairly exclude situations where parity in sentencing should rightfully apply. This is best illustrated by an example. If two persons agree to rob a victim at a particular location and proceed to carry out the robbery together, this would be a classic case of “co-offenders in the strict sense, that is persons involved in and charged with 
the very same crime
” [emphasis added] (
per
 Howie J in 
Jimmy
 at [245]), and the parity principle would undoubtedly apply in relation to the sentencing of those two persons. If, however, the same two persons agree that they will rob two separate victims at the same location, 
with each person tackling one victim on his own
, and proceed to carry out that agreement, I see no reason why the parity principle should not apply even though each of the robberies committed would be a separate and distinct offence.
44     In this regard, I note that in 
Public Prosecutor v Lee Wei Zheng Winston
 
[2002] 2 SLR(R) 800
 (“
Winston Lee
”), Yong CJ stated (at [16]) that “[t]he principle of parity is well-established in local sentencing law” and cited, as an illustration of this principle, 
Liow Eng Giap
. In that case, a man called Santhamoorthi was charged with the theft of a tractor, while one Low Yoke Yong (“Low”) and the appellant were charged with dishonest receipt of that stolen tractor (at [2]). Santhamoorthi pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Low similarly pleaded guilty and was fined $1,000. The appellant, in contrast, claimed trial. He was convicted and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The appellant appealed, contending that his sentence was manifestly unjust when compared to the sentences imposed on Santhamoorthi and Low (at [3]). His appeal was allowed, and his sentence was reduced to a fine of $2,000 (six months’ imprisonment in default). Choor Singh J explained his reasons for reducing the appellant’s sentence as follows (at [3]):
3    Before me, it was pleaded on behalf of the appellant that in the first place the appellant has received the same sentence as that imposed on the thief and secondly, that whereas Low the first “receiver”, who made a profit of $4,800 in the transaction, was let off with a fine of $1,000, the appellant who has lost $6,800 in the transaction has been ordered to undergo six months’ imprisonment, and that in these circumstances although the sentence cannot be labelled as excessive having regard to the nature of the crime, it is manifestly unjust having regard to the sentences imposed on the other offenders involved in the criminal transactions concerning the same engine. In my view there is some merit in this submission. As observed earlier 
although I consider that the sentence imposed on the appellant appears to be correct in law and not excessive when considered in the light of the facts relating to the appellant’s case alone, it is relatively excessive when considered in the light of the sentences imposed on the other persons found guilty on charges relating to the same engine
. I am informed that the three offenders were dealt with by different courts and that that probably accounts for the variance in the sentences imposed on the two “receivers”. That may well be so but 
where there are no differentiating factors, as in this case, public interest demands that there should be some consistency in the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing the same 
or similar 
offences. Failure to observe this principle may, as in this case, lead to a legitimate complaint by an appellant that he has been dealt with more severely than another who committed an identical offence.
 It was for these reasons that I decided that the appellant should be given the option of a fine, as such an option was granted to the other “receiver”. The maximum fine that a Magistrate’s Court can impose on an accused person is $2,000. Accordingly I altered the sentence of the appellant from that of six months’ imprisonment to a fine of $2,000 or six months’ imprisonment. I am compelled to observe that the learned magistrate who imposed a fine of $1,000 on Low, the first “receiver” treated the matter very lightly. Even after paying the fine, that offender made a profit of $3,800. In determining the quantum of a fine a trial magistrate should always take into consideration the profit arising from the offence. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
45     I note that 
Liow Eng Giap
 dealt with a situation where the three offenders concerned committed distinct offences involving the same piece of stolen property, and that Singh J did not explicitly state that he was applying the parity principle when he reduced the appellant’s sentence. However, it seems to me that the learned judge was, in substance, applying the parity principle – and arguably, the Broad View of the principle at that, since he made his comments on the need for consistency in sentencing in the context of “the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing the same 
or similar
 offences” [emphasis added] (see [3] of 
Liow Eng Giap
). Interestingly, it was this very remark by Singh J – 
viz
, that “where there are no differentiating factors, … public interest demands that there should be some consistency in the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing the same or similar offences” – which Yong CJ cited at [16] of 
Winston Lee
 as a statement of the parity principle. This would suggest that the Broad View of the principle may, in appropriate cases, have a place in our law. I should point out here that at [16] of 
Winston Lee
, Yong CJ also cited the passage from [7] of his earlier decision in 
Ramlee
 (see [27] above), in addition to 
Liow Eng Giap
, as case authority for the parity principle. That passage from 
Ramlee
 sets out the 
Narrow
 View of the parity principle, as can be seen from Yong CJ’s specific reference there to “two or more offenders … sentenced for participation in 
the same offence
” [emphasis added]. However, since the offenders involved in the common criminal enterprise in 
Ramlee
 were all charged with the same offence such that the factual situation in 
Kerr
 did not arise, I do not see that passage from 
Ramlee
 as ruling out the application of the Broad View in Singapore in appropriate cases. Similarly, Yong CJ’s comment in 
Phua Song Hua
 at [38] that “[t]he principle of parity of sentence is irrelevant once there are different offences” must be read in the context of that case, where, as mentioned earlier (see [38] above), the appellant was charged with a more serious offence which carried a much longer maximum term of imprisonment than the offence which his co-offenders had been charged with.
46     Before moving on, I must stress that while the parity principle states that the sentences imposed on the offenders engaged in the same offence or the same criminal enterprise should, generally speaking, be the same, relevant differences in the offenders’ respective degrees of responsibility and/or respective personal circumstances must be accounted for. As Yong CJ pointed out in in 
Lim Poh Tee v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 1 SLR(R) 241
 at [36]:
… [W]hile consistency in sentencing is desirable, the varying degrees of culpability and the unique circumstances of each case play an equally, if not more important role. …
Application of the parity principle in the present case
47     I turn now to the application of the parity principle to the facts of the present case. In this regard, it is necessary for me to first set out those passages in the Statement of Facts which disclose some sort of relationship between the Appellant, Keith and Ah Tee in their illegal 4D betting and football bookmaking enterprise:
[note: 15]
4.    Investigations revealed that the exhibits seized were related to [the Appellant’s] illegal 4-D betting, 4-D [bet] collection and illegal soccer bookmaking activities. Sometime in early June 2010, [the Appellant] had obtained an online soccer ‘Master Agent’ account from her brother Lim Chin-U Keith and used the online soccer account to collect soccer bets. The soccer account came with a $1,100,000 credits [
sic
] bet limit via agt.ibc88.com. Investigations further revealed that the [Appellant] had collected bets from her bettors and placed the respective soccer bets into the account.
5.    Investigations further disclosed that the [Appellant] would have earned 20% to 90% of commission whenever her bettors had incurred losses from their bets placed on every soccer match. Investigations also revealed that [the Appellant] had obtained an online 4-D betting account from her brother Lim Chin-U Keith and used the account to purchase and place illegal 4-D bets. The online 4-D account came with a credit limit of $12,000/- via a website www.st999.net.com. 
At the end of the day, [the Appellant] would settle the soccer bets and 4-D account with her brother Lim Chin-U Keith using cash.
6.    Separately, [the Appellant] had also obtained another online 4-D account from ‘Ah Tee’ via website www.galaxy188.com, and used the online 4-D account to collect illegal 4-D bets. The online 4-D [account] came with a credit limit of $35,000/-. [The Appellant] was given a commission of 7% from the total bets collected and an additional 5% when her punters [struck] 4-D bets. 
At the end of the day, [the Appellant] would settle the 4-D bets accounts with ‘Ah Tee’ using cash. [The Appellant] would usually communicate the bets with her punters and bettors, ‘Ah Tee’ and her brother via her ‘I-phone’ phone and login to her online agent soccer account and 4-D accounts using her laptop or I-pad.
…
12.    The identity of ‘Ah Tee’ is known as Ng Leong Chuan, male, 56 years old. Both Ng Leong Chuan and Lim Chin-U Keith have been 
dealt with
.
[underlining and emphasis in bold in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]
48     The Third, Fourth and Fifth Proceeded Charges against the Appellant involve the same offence as the charges proceeded with against her brother, Keith (namely, the offence under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA), the difference being in the value of the bets and the football matches involved. As for Ah Tee, although the charges proceeded with against him involved the offence under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA, the prescribed punishment for that offence is the same as the prescribed punishment for the offence under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA. There is thus no complication arising from the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges against the Appellant involving an offence of a different degree of seriousness from the offences set out in the charges proceeded with against her co-offenders, Keith and Ah Tee.
49     It seems to me clear that this case attracts the operation of the parity principle. To set things in context, while the Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate of ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of $141,000 (in default, 22 weeks’ imprisonment) for the Proceeded Charges, Keith was sentenced to an aggregate of four weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $18,000 (in default, 16 weeks’ imprisonment), and Ah Tee, to an aggregate of 24 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $165,000 (in default, 66 weeks’ imprisonment). I acknowledge that the value of the bets placed with each offender was an important factor in determining the aggregate sentence that each of them received. However, the question that remains is whether the disparity between the respective sentences received by the Appellant, Keith and Ah Tee, particularly as between the Appellant and Keith, would result in right-thinking members of the public with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances considering the aggregate sentence imposed on the Appellant to be unjust. In this regard, I note that the Respondent acknowledged (at para 27(f) of its written submissions) that pertinent information relating to Keith’s and Ah Tee’s sentences was not provided in the court below, and was thus 
not considered
 by the Sentencing Judge when the Appellant was sentenced:
Both Lim Chin-U Keith and one “Ah Tee” were less culpable than the [Appellant] and hence, 
even if the [S]entencing [J]udge had considered their sentences
, he would still come to the same conclusion. [emphasis added]
50     At the hearing before the Sentencing Judge, the Respondent provided scant material on Keith’s and Ah Tee’s sentences and how they were arrived at. In the context of sentencing procedure, I find this less than ideal, given that Keith and Ah Tee were clearly involved in the Appellant’s illegal activities in two ways:
(a)     First, as can be seen from those passages of the Statement of Facts quoted at [47] above, Keith and Ah Tee were the ones who roped the Appellant into the business of illegal 4D betting and football bookmaking.
(b)     Second, Keith and Ah Tee also assisted the Appellant in her commission of the offences by facilitating the operation of her illegal enterprise. The Statement of Facts reveals that some form of accounting took place between the Appellant and Keith as well as between the Appellant and Ah Tee, whereby she would settle football bets and 4D bets with them separately, and would communicate with them separately regarding the illegal bets placed by her punters and bettors.
[note: 16]
The same point is mentioned (in greater detail) in the Statement of Facts in Ah Tee’s case, and I set out the relevant portion below:
6    Investigations revealed that [Ah Tee] decided to enlist the help of two friends to help him collect bets. He enlisted the help of one Karen Lim Bee Ngan [
ie
, the Appellant] … to collect illegal 4-D lottery. To do so, he issued Karen Lim with an online betting account … Investigations further revealed that Karen Lim was to charge punters a rate of S$1.60 for one “Big” ticket and S$0.70 for one “Small” ticket. In return, [Ah Tee] promised Karen Lim a commission of 7% of the total bet value [placed] by her punters. In addition, Karen Lim was also entitled to another 5% of the winnings by her punters. Upon completion of the lottery, [Ah Tee] would settle the accounts with a runner … before settling the accounts with Karen Lim personally.
51     Reading both Statements of Facts together, it is clear that a business arrangement – albeit an unlawful one – existed between the Appellant and Keith as well as between the Appellant and Ah Tee, pursuant to which illegal 4D betting and football betting were carried out. The Appellant’s involvement in illegal football betting was initiated, facilitated and assisted by Keith; the Appellant was also introduced to illegal 4D betting by both Keith and Ah Tee. It thus appears that the Appellant engaged in two types of illegal betting – one of 4D betting involving Keith and Ah Tee, and another of football betting involving Keith. Although this criminal enterprise was arranged in a rather loose and informal fashion, I do not think that is of any consequence as the operation of the parity principle should not be dictated by how the parties organise their common criminal enterprise – an illegal betting ring might be run in a very top-down fashion with a single figure having most of the decision-making power; or, conversely, in a more 
laissez-faire
 manner with each person running his or her own illegal betting enterprise, but mutually facilitating each other in the commission of illegal betting through the pooling of resources or in other ways. Under both models, a criminal enterprise is perpetuated. I also find that the disparity between the respective sentences imposed on the Appellant, Keith and Ah Tee is not due to the different charges proceeded with against them, given that: (a) as mentioned earlier at [48] above, s 5(
a
) of the CHGA and s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA prescribe the same minimum and maximum punishments; and (b) sentences for offences under these two provisions are meted out in a similar manner (see Practitioners’ Library, 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“the 
Sentencing Book
”) at p 1789). Thus, the concern underlying the criticisms of 
Kerr
 in 
Formosa
, 
Jimmy
 and Bell J’s minority judgment in 
Green
 (see [35]–[37] above) – 
viz
, that the parity principle might be inappropriately used to remedy sentencing disparities caused by a prosecutorial decision to bring different charges against different co-offenders – does not arise here.
52     For the above reasons, I agree with the Appellant that the Sentencing Judge erred as to the proper factual basis for sentencing by failing to consider the parity principle in sentencing the Appellant. As pointed out by the Appellant’s counsel, Mr Chan, the Statement of Facts did not disclose how Keith and Ah Tee were “dealt with”.
[note: 17]
 I also note that at the oral hearing before me, Mr Chan, who was not the Appellant’s counsel in the court below, stated that he had faced difficulties in obtaining the relevant material from the State Courts when he requested for the material after he took on the case. In response, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant, being Keith’s sister, would have known of Keith’s sentence and should have mentioned his sentence to the Sentencing Judge even though the Respondent had not provided the relevant details. In my view, this is hardly an adequate retort – if it is the Prosecution’s duty to assist the court by providing relevant material pertaining to the sentences received by co-offenders (a point which I shall discuss at [53]–[62] below), then the question of whether an accused informs his sentencing judge of the sentences that his or her co-offenders received (assuming the accused has this information) is beside the point. It might be wise for the accused to highlight to the court the sentences received by his or her co-offenders; but, even if he or she does so, he or she might not be able to assist the court meaningfully due to the information asymmetry between him or her and the Prosecution – the accused might not even have the relevant information to begin with; and even if he does have such information, the co-offenders’ sentencing judge might have taken into account factors unique to the co-offenders, such as antecedents, which would not be applicable to the accused.
Is the Respondent under a duty to disclose to the court all relevant material pertaining to the sentences imposed on Keith and Ah Tee?
53     The objective of the parity principle is to ensure that there is a 
high level of consistency in sentencing
 (see 
Public Prosecutor v UI
 
[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500
 at [19]). In cases where the parity principle is applicable, it is appropriate to hold that the Prosecution has a duty to assist the court in sentencing an accused. This was recently alluded to by See Kee Oon JC in 
Public Prosecutor v Development 26 Pte Ltd
 
[2015] 1 SLR 309
, where he stated at [24]:
… 
A prosecutor, whether from the [Attorney-General’s Chambers] or some other government agency, is duty-bound to assist the court to make a decision on sentence.
 This basic tenet was reiterated recently by the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justice Steven Chong in their respective speeches at the Sentencing Conference on 9 and 10 October 2014. When the prosecutor puts forward a range of sentences based on precedent without making an attempt to distinguish the precedents, the court cannot but understand that to be a submission that the sentence ought properly to fall within that range. The court may of course take the view that the correct sentence is nevertheless one that is outside the suggested range, but that is another matter altogether. [emphasis added]
54     For a better appreciation of the remarks made by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the speech mentioned in the above quotation, I now set out that part of the speech 
in extenso
 (see Sundaresh Menon, “Sentencing Conference 2014: Opening Address” (9 October 2014) <https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/5601/Opening%20Address%20-%20Sentencing%20Confererence%20on%209%20October%20%20%28101014%20-%20Check%20against%20delivery%29.pdf> (accessed 14 July 2015) at paras 34–39):
34    … The Prosecution owes a duty to the court and to the wider public to ensure that the factually guilty and only the factually guilty are convicted, and that all relevant material is placed before the court to assist it in its determination of the truth. 
This duty extends to the stage of sentencing where the Prosecution should place all the relevant facts of the offence and the offender before the court. Furthermore, the Prosecution should always be prepared to assist the court on any issues of sentencing.
 But what does this mean in practical terms?
35    It is perhaps possible to extrapolate from those principles that are widely accepted and to arrive at some thoughts about the prosecutorial role in sentencing. First, the Prosecution acts only in the public interest. That immediately distinguishes it from those who appear in a private law suit to pursue the interest of a private client. On this basis, there would generally be no need for the Prosecution to adopt a strictly adversarial position. Second, that public interest extends not only to securing the conviction in a lawful and ethical manner of those who are factually guilty, but also to securing the appropriate sentence.
36    The latter point is a critical one. Private victories tend to be measured by the size of the damages awarded or the pain inflicted on the opposing side. But 
the prosecutorial function is not calibrated by that scale. The appropriate sentence will often 
not 
bear a linear relationship to the circumstances
. … Hence, 
this calls for the Prosecution to reflect on why it takes a particular view of what sentence is called for in a given case and to articulate those considerations so that the sentencing judge can assess these and assign them the appropriate weight
.
37    I suggest that the Prosecution can play a vital role by identifying to the court:
(a)    The relevant sentencing precedents, benchmarks and guidelines;
(b)     
The relevant facts and circumstances of the offence and of the offender that inform where in a range of sentences the case at hand may be situated
;
(c)    The offender’s suitability and other relevant considerations that may bear upon whether particular sentencing options that might be available should be invoked;
(d)    The relevant aggravating and mitigating considerations;
(e)    The relevant considerations that pertain to aggregating sentences;
(f)    Any particular interest or consideration that is relevant and that pertains to the victim; and
(g)    Where it may be appropriate to order compensation to be paid to the victim, the relevant considerations (including the appropriate quantum).
38     
While the Prosecution may take the position that a certain sentencing range is appropriate in the circumstances, it must present all the relevant materials to enable the court to come to its own conclusion as to what the just sentence should be
.
39    These broad guidelines can be supplemented with another very practical point. All the relevant facts must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and in guilty pleas, the accused must know all the facts on the basis of which he pleaded guilty. For the Prosecution to raise a fact undisclosed in the statement of facts or ask the court to draw an inference from the facts at the stage of sentencing may be unfairly prejudicial to the offender, who cannot be punished for something that is not proven. Hence, the statement of facts must be prepared with this in mind.
[emphasis in original in bold italics; emphasis added in italics]
55     The Prosecution’s duty to assist the court in sentencing is recognised in the Code of Practice for the Conduct of Criminal Proceedings by the Prosecution and the Defence issued by the Attorney-General’s Chambers, which states at para 45:
45.    Prosecutors and Defence Counsel should bring to the attention of the court 
any matters of law relevant to sentence
 such as:
(a)    any legal limitations on sentence, including the maximum sentence, and whether the court has jurisdiction to impose any particular sentence;
(b)    any sentencing guidelines or guideline cases setting out the tariff or benchmark sentence; and
(c)    any relevant statutory provisions relating to ancillary orders (e.g. community service orders).
[emphasis added]
56     Where the parity principle is applicable, it is ideal for the offenders involved in the common criminal enterprise in question to be sentenced by the same judge at the same time; indeed, it was recognised in 
Dwahi v The Queen
 [2011] NSWCCA 67 at [46] that such a practice is grounded in the public interest of having transparency and consistency in sentencing co-offenders. The reasons for this are intensely practical – sentencing is not an exact science, and the views in Australia and England corroborate this. In 
Rae v R
 [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [52]–[56], the NSWCCA commented:
52    There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge at the same time, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them …
53    Different Judges may take different views as to the relevant culpability of related offenders …
54    Where co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may be differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing Judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation involved, with this flowing in part from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders. …
55    Strong maintenance of the practice of related offenders being sentenced by the same Judge at the same time will serve the public interest in consistent and transparent sentencing of related offenders which underlies the parity principle itself …
56    A recurring theme in the authorities is that, where co-offenders are sentenced after hearings before different Judges, there may be different evidence and submissions, leading to different conclusions being expressed by the sentencing Judges concerning [the] criminal conduct of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise.
Similarly, P J Richardson and William Carter, 
Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 2014) states at para 5-158 that wherever practicable, all the offenders involved in a particular offence should be sentenced by the same judge.
57     Unfortunately, ideal as it may be for co-offenders to be sentenced at the same time by the same sentencing judge, it is often not possible for a variety of reasons. This was recognised by the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Stephen Broadbridge
 (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 269, which remarked (at 271–272):
This court has said many times that it is desirable that co-accused should, if possible, be sentenced at the same time, and in any event by a judge common to all of them. But sometimes it is not possible, since some defendants plead guilty and others not guilty, and those who have pleaded guilty are dealt with if there is to be delay before the others are sentenced. Here the judge had to sentence an accused who had pleaded guilty and had been convicted, and whose co-accused some time earlier had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced by a different judge.
It is a situation which unfortunately often arises. Usually the judge who still has to pass sentence will be told what sentence the co-accused received, and no doubt that will be one of the factors which he considers when determining the sentence that he should pass. But it appears to be submitted here that he ought to pass the same sentence as was passed on the co-accused unless he can distinguish between them. It is argued that to equip himself to perceive whether there are any differentiating features between the two cases the judge should, if asked, and perhaps even if not asked, adjourn the case before him in order to be informed of the detailed circumstances of the case that he has not tried, and no doubt obtain a transcript of the proceedings in that other case. That was the suggestion that was made to the learned judge below in this case, and, in our view, he rightly rejected it. The duty of the sentencing judge is to deal with the person who is before him for the offence that he committed, allowing in so doing for such favourable circumstances as there are, such as, for example, that the accused pleaded guilty. …
58     In cases where the sentencing of co-offenders cannot take place before the same sentencing judge at the same time, the Prosecution should, as far as possible, assist in the sentencing of the particular offender concerned by tendering to the court all relevant material pertaining to the sentences meted out to earlier-sentenced co-offenders. As stated in 
Sentencing Principles in Singapore
 (at para 13.028):
For the purpose of ensuring parity in sentencing, it is undesirable for co-offenders to be sentenced by separate judges, or by the same judge on separate occasions: 
R v Rudra Nath
 (1994) 74 A Crim R 115 at [14]. Australian courts have taken the position that 
where co-offenders are sentenced by different judges, it is essential that the judge who sentences the last offender should have full details of the sentence passed on the co-offender earlier, including the reasons for the sentence and the statement of facts relating to the circumstances of the offence for the first offender
: 
Dickes
 (1983) 10 ACR 89. It was further held in 
Brindley
 (1993) 66 ACR 204 that 
the Prosecution is obliged to supply such information
. [emphasis added]
59      
Public Prosecutor v Norhisham bin Mohamad Dahlan
 
[2004] 1 SLR(R) 48
 is a case where the aforesaid duty was satisfactorily discharged. In that case, the sentencing judge imposed on the accused a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Another sentencing judge had earlier sentenced one of the accused’s co-offenders (“Hasik”) to life imprisonment for the same offence. The sentencing judge in the accused’s case was aware of this fact, but nonetheless imposed a less severe sentence on the accused on the grounds that (
inter alia
) unlike Hasik, the accused did not have a previous conviction for a violent offence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal for the accused’s imprisonment term to be increased to life imprisonment, noting that (at [11]):
… [The accused’s sentencing judge] was aware of the fact that [another sentencing judge] had sentenced Hasik to a term of life imprisonment. He was therefore fully aware of the fact that if he sentenced the [accused] to anything less than life imprisonment …, there would be a large disparity in sentence, since the next longest sentence available … was ten years’ imprisonment. … [I]t was clear that [the accused’s sentencing judge] had anticipated the issue of disparity in sentence and had addressed his mind to this concern by explaining why he was opting for the ten-year tariff rather than the life tariff.
60     In contrast, 
Samuel James Dickes
 (1983) 10 A Crim R 88 (“
Dickes
”) and 
Brian John Brindley
 (1993) 66 A Crim R 204 (“
Brindley
”) are two illustrations of cases where the Prosecution failed to discharge its duty of disclosure in relation to the sentencing of co-offenders. In 
Dickes
, the appellant pleaded guilty to breaking into a tavern in the early morning with two other persons and removing A$3,000 in cash (at 92). While his two co-offenders were jointly charged, he was charged separately (at 92–93). As matters turned out, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment without any non-parole period being specified, while one of his co-offenders was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months and the other co-offender, to three years’ probation (at 93). The appellant appealed on the basis that his sentence was disproportionate to those imposed on his co-offenders. The Western Australia Court of Criminal Appeal agreed and allowed the appeal, resentencing him to an imprisonment term of two years, but likewise without any non-parole period being specified (at 95). Rowland J held that the sentencing judge should have full details of the following in sentencing an offender involved in a common criminal enterprise (at 94):
(a)     the sentence passed earlier on the co-offender ;
(b)     that co-offender’s antecedents report, if any;
(c)     the reasons given by the earlier sentencing judge for imposing the sentence which he did on the co-offender; and
(d)     the statement of facts relating to the circumstances of the offences as given to the earlier sentencing judge.
61     In 
Brindley
, the accused, together with three others, assaulted and robbed two men, one of A$90 and the other, of A$2,000, late at night. The accused was charged with being an accessory in relation to the first incident, and with assault in relation to the second. He pleaded guilty to both offences, and was sentenced to two years and eight months’ imprisonment for the first incident and a concurrent term of nine months’ imprisonment for the second incident. The accused appealed on the basis that his sentence was disproportionate when compared to the sentence imposed on one of his co-offenders (“R”), which was two years’ imprisonment for a charge of robbery with striking in relation to the first incident and a two-year bond for a charge of assault in relation to the second incident. The accused contended that although the sentencing judge in his case had been informed of R’s sentence, he had not been provided with the details of that sentence and had therefore failed to have “due regard to principles of parity” (at 206). The NSWCCA agreed with the accused and allowed his appeal, resentencing him to 20 months’ imprisonment for the accessory charge in relation to the first incident. The NSWCCA did not, however, alter the nine-month imprisonment term imposed by the accused’s sentencing judge for the assault charge in relation to the second incident. In arriving at its decision, the NSWCCA noted (at 206–207) that although the accused’s sentencing judge had been informed of the sentence imposed on R:
… [H]e was not given either a copy of Judge Garling’s remarks on sentence [Judge Garling being R’s sentencing judge] or any idea of the basis upon which that sentence had been imposed. This was very unfortunate. The Crown is under an obligation to give sentencing judges such assistance, and it failed to satisfy that obligation in this case. It may well have been that a transcript was not then available, but the Crown undoubtedly had the note of its representative who appeared before Judge Garling, and that information was important where another judge was sentencing a co-offender.
… There is a lot less inconvenience and loss of time and expense if the sentencing proceedings are adjourned until the information is obtained than if the prisoner is forced to come to this Court to correct disparity created through the absence of such information.
62     Before moving on, I observe that Mr Chan cited 
Kadar (No 1)
 at [109] and 
Kadar (No 2)
 at [20] as authorities for the proposition that the Respondent was under a duty to disclose all relevant material pertaining to the sentences imposed on Keith and Ah Tee. While I agree that 
vis-à-vis
 the sentencing of offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise, the Prosecution is under a duty to provide the court with relevant material on the sentence(s) imposed on the co-offender(s) of the particular accused being sentenced, I do not agree that 
Kadar (No 1)
 and 
Kadar (No 2)
 are the appropriate authorities for this duty. The comments in 
Kadar (No 1)
 and 
Kadar (No 2)
 were made in the context of disclosing 
unused material in the hands of the Prosecution
 for the purposes of securing safe 
convictions
; they were not made in relation to disclosing relevant material pertaining to 
sentencing
.
My decision on the appropriate sentence to impose
63     In view of the fact that the Sentencing Judge did not take into account the parity principle, and this seems in no small part due to the fact that the Respondent did not place before him pertinent material relating to the sentences imposed on Keith and Ah Tee, the Sentencing Judge, with respect, erred with regard to the proper factual basis for sentencing (see [25(a)] above). This court, sitting as an appellate court, is thus entitled to determine afresh what the appropriate aggregate sentence to impose on the Appellant ought to be. To this end, I begin by setting out in the following table the offences which Keith and Ah Tee were charged with and the aggregate sentences which they received:
 
Accused
 
 
Offences
 
 
Sentence imposed
 
 
Keith 
 
 
Proceeded with: Four counts under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA.
 
Taken into consideration for sentencing: Eight counts under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA. 
 
Total quantum of the bets placed with him was $4,719.
 
 
Aggregate sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $18,000 (in default, 16 weeks’ imprisonment).
 
 
Ah Tee
 
 
Proceeded with: Eight counts under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA.
 
Taken into consideration for sentencing: 12 counts under s 5(
a
) of the CGHA, and two counts under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). 
 
Total quantum of the bets placed with him was $7,954.
 
 
Aggregate sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $165,000 (in default, 66 weeks’ imprisonment).
 
64     From the decided cases on offences under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA, the following can be observed (see the 
Sentencing Book
 at p 1789):
(a)     Where the value of the bets involved is less than $1,000, a first-time offender with no previous convictions or any aggravating circumstances is usually sentenced to a short custodial term of two weeks and fined $20,000.
(b)     Where the value of the bets involved is between $1,000 and $10,000, the usual sentence is in the region of one to two months’ imprisonment and a fine of at least $25,000.
(c)     Where the value of the bets involved is very substantial, the court will impose either a hefty or the maximum fine and a long custodial sentence.
65     Naturally, and quite logically too, the sentence imposed for an offence under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA would be more severe the greater the value of the bets involved, although the increase in the severity of the sentence need not be proportional or linear to the increase in the value of the bets; equally relevant would be the antecedents (if any) of the offender. The following precedents were cited to me by both counsel:
(a)     The first case was 
Tan Kwee Swe v Public Prosecutor
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 335 of 1999) (“
Tan Kwee Swe
”). In that case, the accused was involved as a runner in an illegal bookmaking operation. The evidence showed that he had taken a substantial number of bets valued at $12,600 in total. He was given a sentence of six months’ imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 (in default, six months’ imprisonment). No further details were provided as to why the court arrived at this sentence, and the only information about this case is to be found in the 
Sentencing Book
 at p 1800.
(b)     The second case was 
Public Prosecutor v Chee Kok Yeong
 
[2003] SGMC 8
 (“
Chee Kok Yeong
”), where the accused was a runner involved in a “well-organised” football betting operation (at [18]). Three charges were proceeded with against him, and four charges were taken into account for sentencing purposes. The total value of the bets involved was $456,750 (at [21]). Similar to the Appellant, the accused suffered from depression and insomnia at the material time, and was seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health. He was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment and fined $200,000 (in default, six months’ imprisonment) for each of the charges proceeded with. Two of the imprisonment terms were ordered to run consecutively, making an aggregate imprisonment term of 14 months (at [29]).
(c)     The third case was 
Public Prosecutor v Oke Ah Bang
 
[2005] SGMC 1
 (“
Oke Ah Bang
”). There, the accused elected to claim trial, but he subsequently chose to remain silent at the trial and did not call any witnesses (see the 
Sentencing Book
 at p 1803). The total value of the bets involved exceeded $10,000. On those facts, the accused was convicted of one charge under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA. The judge sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 (in default, six months’ imprisonment) after referring to 
Tan Kwee Swe
 (see 
Oke Ah Bang
 at [43]).
(d)     The fourth case was Public 
Prosecutor v Goh Liang Seah & Another
 
[2006] SGMC 19
. There, the two offenders had assisted an unknown Malaysian bookmaker as “pencillers” in recording illegal bets. They were part of a cross-border illegal bookmaking syndicate; hence, there was a public interest in imposing a stiff sentence, with general deterrence as a key sentencing consideration. The value of the bets involved was $52,850 in relation to one of the offenders and $53,530 in relation to the other offender. Both offenders were sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of $20,000 (in default, two months’ imprisonment).
66     Returning to the facts of the present case, I note from the Statement of Facts that the Appellant obtained her online football and 4D betting accounts in early June 2010,
[note: 18]
 and carried out her criminal enterprise primarily over the Internet. Before this court, the Respondent contended that the Appellant’s use of the Internet to carry out her illegal activities was an aggravating factor for two reasons:
(a)     The Internet provided a shroud of anonymity, such that the Appellant’s crimes were harder for the police to detect. Had the police not been tipped-off, the Appellant’s illegal activities “would [have been] wholly unhampered”.
[note: 19]
(b)     It was easy for offences to be carried out with the aid of technology and computerisation. In this regard, the Respondent pointed out that the 
Sentencing Book
 highlighted (at p 1790) that the use of high-tech or sophisticated equipment to commit offences such as those committed by the Appellant was a major aggravating factor, as was the use of surveillance systems to avoid detection.
[note: 20]
67     I agree with the Respondent that the Appellant’s use of the Internet to carry out her nefarious activities is an aggravating factor in this case as it facilitated the commission of those activities and made detection more difficult. In both 
Auyok Kim Tye v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] SGMC 17
 at [18] and 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Suan Cheng
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 246 of 1993), the use of high-tech equipment which facilitated the carrying out of illegal betting, such as telephones, transceivers and CCTV surveillance systems, was considered to be an aggravating factor. Since the use of the Internet by the Appellant in this case facilitated the placing of bets by her bettors and made detection more difficult, it should similarly be considered an aggravating factor. I now address what the Appellant submits are the mitigating factors.
68     The mitigating factors relied on by the Appellant can be grouped into three categories:
(a)     factors which go towards showing whether the Appellant is a first-time offender;
(b)     factors which go towards showing whether the Appellant demonstrated genuine remorse for her actions; and
(c)     factors which go towards showing whether the Appellant’s poor mental health and her role as the primary care-giver in her family were given adequate consideration by the Sentencing Judge.
69     With regard to the first category of mitigating factors, the Appellant contends that she is a first-time offender,
[note: 21]
 whereas the Respondent submits otherwise.
[note: 22]
 In 
Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor
 
[2003] 2 SLR(R) 334
 at [15], Yong CJ held that it was the court’s prerogative to 
refuse
 to consider any person a first-time offender if he had been charged with multiple offences, even if he had no prior convictions. Although the courts should, in general, be cautious in refusing to regard such persons as first-time offenders, in my judgment, the Appellant should not be considered a first-time offender given the number of offences she was charged with and the length of time over which she carried out her illegal activities. It is merely her good fortune that she was not caught earlier. For these reasons, I do not think it appropriate to regard her as a first-time offender.
70     The second category of mitigating factors concerns the Appellant’s guilty plea. Mr Chan submits that the Sentencing Judge did not give due consideration to the fact that right from the start, the Appellant cooperated fully with the police and pleaded guilty at an early stage of the proceedings. He further argues that the Appellant’s actions show that she was and is genuinely remorseful for her illegal activities, and that should be taken into account for sentencing purposes.
[note: 23]
 While it is trite that a guilty plea is a factor which the court may take into account in mitigation as evidence of remorse, the weight that should be attributed to it would depend on the facts of the particular case concerned (see 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor
 
[1990] 2 SLR(R) 361
 at [10]–[17]). In the present case, I agree with Mr Chan that due consideration should be given to the Appellant for her ready cooperation with the police the minute that she was arrested. Her cooperation is evident from the Statement of Facts, which records that while she was at the CID for further questioning (see [2] above), she logged on to her online football and 4D betting accounts and printed out the Exhibits, thereby assisting the police in the investigations. In my judgment, the Appellant’s actions were those of a person who was genuinely remorseful and wished to come clean. Her conduct post-arrest is clearly mitigating for the purposes of sentencing. It would probably not be wrong to infer that had the Appellant not voluntarily logged on to her online accounts to print out the Exhibits, some of the charges which were subsequently brought against her might not even have surfaced.
71     The third category of mitigating factors which the Appellant relies on pertains to her personal circumstances of hardship. The Appellant submits that the Sentencing Judge failed to give sufficient consideration to the fact that she has been experiencing considerable mental distress, has a history of panic attacks and is being medicated for her condition.
[note: 24]
 She also reiterates that her family’s financial burdens have fallen upon her – her father is terminally ill with Stage Four cancer, and she has two young children aged five and two this year. Her older child suffers from a chronic respiratory condition and requires frequent medical attention.
[note: 25]
 To give a better feel of the Appellant’s personal predicament, I set out what her counsel in the court below submitted in mitigation before the Sentencing Judge:
[note: 26]
4    Ms Lim [
ie
, the Appellant] and her father are extremely close as she is the only daughter and is much loved by both her father and her mother … Her mother is in her sixties and is a housewife. She is also sickly as she suffers from depression and has been receiving outpatient treatment at the KK Women’s Hospital ever since her husband succumbed to cancer.
…
8    Since she was pregnant with [X], Ms Lim gave up her regular job as she and her husband decided it was best that she became a homemaker and further, she was breastfeeding [X] for more than a year. Her second son … was born on October 2013. This child was only recently, despite much difficulty, weaned off from breastfeeding since Ms Lim found out that the prison did not have facilities to facilitate her pumping breast milk and passing it to her husband daily to feed the baby. This infant falls ill very frequently ever since Ms Lim stopped breastfeeding him since 2 weeks ago when she started to wean him off as she was aware that she would face incarceration for the present offences. This infant is 6 months old at present and the burden of taking care of him falls squarely upon her husband’s shoulders, [who] is entrusted to take care of this child.
…
16    We are mindful that personal hardship is generally of little [mitigation] value as held in ‘Jenny’s’ case in a High Court decision [
ie
, 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor
 
[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406
]. But however, in the present case before Your Honour, the hardship that Ms Lim faces [is] not singular but [manifold]. Firstly, her father can [die] at any time. He is literally or to put it medically, left to die with basic care and is bedridden most times. And further, she is being separated from her 2 very young children. Her eldest boy is barely 3 years old whilst her second child whom she had been nursing is only 6 months old. She has broken down many times and suffered panic attacks not because she is going to be incarcerated but because it is going to be very difficult for her husband to be a single parent for both children and to nurse the younger child given his own job commitments and so forth.
72     Although I sympathise with the Appellant’s personal circumstances, it is trite law that generally, the hardship that may be faced by an accused’s family because of the sentence to be imposed by the court should not be taken into account for sentencing purposes, unless the circumstances are “
very
 exceptional or extreme” [emphasis added] (see 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor
 
[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406
 (“
Jenny Lai
”) at [10]). A slightly different issue arises where an offender commits an offence due to circumstances which are not brought about by any fault of his own (for example, due to illness or some other pressing personal circumstances that are not of his own making). It is of interest to note that in 
Jenny Lai
, Yong CJ said at [10]:
All too often, it is stated in mitigation of an offence, frequently an offence against property, that the offender was motivated by the need for money, perhaps to purchase drugs to feed an addiction, or to pay off gambling debts, or to relieve some urgent need that arose because he had been unwise or profligate. For my part, I find this argument to be entirely unmeritorious in these cases. The whole purpose of the law is to maintain order and discipline, and that is most necessary precisely when the citizen might be inclined to act to the prejudice of good order. … It may well be that some 
very exceptional or extreme
 circumstances may arise warranting the constitution of those financial difficulties as a mitigating factor, the weight attributed to it to be at the discretion of the court. However these circumstances will be very rare, if indeed they ever occur. [emphasis added]
73     I agree with Yong CJ that a case involving “very exceptional or extreme circumstances” 
may
 call for different treatment by the court, as compared to a case where (for instance) the offender steals or engages in illegal betting because of circumstances of hardship caused by his own actions, or because of greed, or simply as a means of making easy money. In short, the court should examine the motivation behind the offence, and if the offence was prompted by personal hardship caused by factors beyond the offender’s control, such mitigating circumstances 
may
, in appropriate cases, be looked upon more favourably and given due consideration. In the present case, other than the Appellant’s bald assertion that she needed money to meet the needs of her family, nothing more concrete was placed before the court. The evidence does not indicate whether at the time the Appellant began her illegal activities, her father had already been diagnosed with Stage Four cancer or whether that fact was made known to her only later. As against this, the criminal activities which were the subject of the charges against the Appellant (both the Proceeded Charges and the TIC Charges) commenced in early June 2010 and continued for some three years before they were detected. All things considered, I do not find it possible to give the Appellant’s assertion of manifold personal hardship much weight.
Conclusion
74     As alluded to earlier (at [64]–[65] above), where offences under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA are concerned, the higher the value of the bets involved, the more severe the punishment imposed should be. However, while the value of the bets involved is a weighty and relevant factor, the increase in the severity of the sentence imposed does not, and should not, progress proportionally or linearly to the increase in the value of the bets (see [65] above); otherwise, it would be hard to explain the sentence imposed on Keith and that imposed in 
Chee Kok Yeong
. Bearing in mind the benchmarks set out in the 
Sentencing Book
 (see [64] above) as well as the relevant aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances in this case, and taking into account the fact that the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges against the Appellant each involved a sum of between approximately $16,000 to $22,000, it seems to me that a reasonable imprisonment term for each of these three Proceeded Charges would be in the range of three to four months. Taking the higher end of this range, and bearing in mind the need to make at least two of the imprisonment sentences for the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges run consecutively pursuant to s 307(1) of the CPC, I consider that an imprisonment term of four months for each of these charges, with two of the imprisonment terms running consecutively – 
ie
, a total imprisonment term of eight months – would be a fair and adequate punishment for the Appellant.
75     The aforesaid aggregate imprisonment term will also be more in line with the imprisonment terms imposed on Keith and Ah Tee, even though in both their cases, the value of the bets involved was much lower. In this regard, as I pointed out earlier (at [50]–[51] above), it was Keith and Ah Tee who introduced the Appellant to and assisted her with illegal 4D betting and football bookmaking at a time when she was not strong enough to resist the temptation of making easy money, having regard to her personal circumstances. I reiterate that both Keith and Ah Tee engaged in illegal 4D betting and football bookmaking earlier than the Appellant; furthermore, the Appellant obtained her online football and 4D betting accounts through them. Finally, I should briefly mention that Keith had no antecedents, while Ah Tee’s antecedents were of a different nature. Thus, their criminal histories are of no consequence to my decision.
76     Ideally, all three offenders – the Appellant, Keith and Ah Tee – should have been sentenced at the same time by the same judge. Unfortunately, that did not occur in the court below. All things considered, I am of the view that an aggregate sentence of eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of $141,000 (in default, 22 weeks’ imprisonment) would suffice to both adequately punish the Appellant as well as serve the purpose of general deterrence.
77     Consequently, I set aside the five-month imprisonment terms imposed by the Sentencing Judge in respect of each of the three Proceeded Charges under s 5(3)(
a
) of the BA (
ie
, the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges), and replace those imprisonment terms with an imprisonment term of four months for each of these three Proceeded Charges. The imprisonment terms for the Third Proceeded Charge and the Fifth Proceeded Charge are to run consecutively, making a total imprisonment term of eight months for the Third to the Fifth Proceeded Charges. I should emphasise that I allow the Appellant’s appeal only to this extent. I make no change to the two-week imprisonment term imposed by the Sentencing Judge in respect of the Second Proceeded Charge and on how it should run. In addition, I uphold the fines imposed by the Sentencing Judge for all five Proceeded Charges as well as the default imprisonment terms in respect of those fines.

Introduction
1       This is an application by the Public Prosecutor for the exercise of the High Court’s powers of revision under s 266 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)(“CPC”) to examine the record of the District Court proceedings in DAC 33059 of 2008 (“DAC 33059”). The petitioner submitted that I should also exercise my powers under s 268 read with s 256(c) of the CPC to alter the sentence imposed on the respondent by District Judge Sarjit Singh (“the District Judge”) on the ground that it was wrong in law. DAC 33059 pertained to an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”) and is punishable under s 33 of that Act. However if there are two previous convictions under s 8(b) of the MDA, s 33A(1)(b) would apply to impose a minimum imprisonment term of five years and caning of not less than three strokes and not more then six strokes of the cane. In 2001, the respondent had been brought before a Juvenile Court and charged under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA for consumption of methamphetamine. The Juvenile Court had made a finding of guilt and ordered him to reside in an approved school for 32 months. The prosecution submitted to the District Judge that the Juvenile Court proceedings constituted a “previous conviction” under s 33A(1). However the District Judge disagreed and sentenced him under s 33 instead of s 33A. The question of law before me is whether the Juvenile Court proceedings constituted a “previous conviction” under s 33A of the MDA (“the Issue”).
Background
2       The facts are as follows. On 10 September 2008, before District Judge Sarjit Singh (“the District Judge”) in Subordinate Court No 4, the respondent pleaded guilty to five charges, namely DAC 31028, 32070, 33057, 33058 and 33059 of 2008. The respondent was convicted of the offences and consented to three other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing pursuant to s 178 of the CPC. The District Judge adjourned the case to 29 September 2008 for sentencing. However on that adjourned date, the District Judge required submissions on the Issue and the prosecution requested an adjournment to check on the point. The matter was adjourned to 16 October 2008, but the prosecution was not ready to submit on that date and a further adjournment was granted, to 30 October 2008. On 30 October 2008, after the prosecution made its submissions, the District Judge adjourned the case for sentencing on 7 November 2008. However at that adjourned hearing, the prosecution applied for a further adjournment and the hearing was re-scheduled to 26 November 2008. But on 26 November 2008 the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”) of the Law Society had put in an application for adjournment so that it can consider assigning counsel to argue the Issue fully. The District Judge granted the application and adjourned the hearing to 19 December 2008. On that new date, CLAS instructed Ms Josephine Choo to act for the respondent and she made her submissions on the Issue to the District Judge. However Ms Choo requested an adjournment to consider the earlier submission of the prosecution which she had just received in order to make her reply. The District Judge adjourned the hearing to 16 January 2009. On that date, after both sides made further submissions, the District Judge made his ruling on the Issue. On 20 January 2009 the District Judge sentenced the respondent to various punishments on the five charges. In relation to DAC 33059, as he held that s 33A of the MDA was not applicable, he sentenced the respondent to three years’ imprisonment under s 33 of the MDA, which had no provision for caning.
3       There was no appeal against the decision of the District Judge within the time fixed for appealing (or at all). The respondent had been in remand all the while and the sentence of caning imposed on him, a total of 12 strokes in relation to DAC 31028 and 32070 of 2008 was duly carried out. Had the respondent been sentenced under the provisions of s 33A of the MDA, he would have received at least another three strokes of the cane.
4       On 13 March 2009, some one and a half months after the District Judge had decided on the matter, the deputy public prosecutor (“Mr Ng”) wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and requested that DAC 33059 be placed before the High Court for the purpose of this criminal revision. On 30 April 2009 after hearing submissions from Mr Ng and from counsel for the respondent, Mr Tan, I reserved judgment on the determination of the Issue. However I was of the view that, even if I were to decide the Issue in accordance with the petitioner’s position, I would not be inclined to disturb the sentence. My reasons for so doing are as follows.
5       The revisionary power of the High Court is vested by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) which provides as follows:
The High Court may exercise powers of revision in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure.
The relevant written law relating to criminal procedure is the CPC and s 266(1) thereof provides that the High Court “may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court”. If the High Court determines that any finding, sentence or order of the subordinate court is not correct, legal or improper, or any proceedings thereof is irregular, s 268(1) provides that the court may, “in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257”. It should be noted that s 268(1) does not require the court to make an order on every occasion that it finds a defect in the finding, sentence or order of, or in the proceedings in, the subordinate court. It gives the court the discretion to act.
6       What, then, are the factors that the court takes into account in the exercise of this discretion? In 
Ang Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, Yong Pung How CJ analysed the Indian authorities on the subject and held (at 330C) that for the court to be moved to act, “there must be some serious injustice”. He further said (at 330C) that “generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below”. In the next paragraph, he said that it was clearly not the intention of the statute for the revisionary jurisdiction to be “little more than another form of appeal”. More recently, in 
Yunani bin Abdul Hamid v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] 3 SLR 383
, V K Rajah JA held (at [46] and [49]) as follows:
46    … The revisionary jurisdiction must not be exercised in such a way that a right of appeal may practically be given whenever such right is definitely excluded by the statutory provisions on criminal procedure (
per
 Piggott J in the Allahabad High Court in 
Ahsan-ullah Khan v Mansukh Ram
 1914 (36) ILR All 403 at 405). It is not the purpose of criminal revision to become a convenient form of “backdoor appeal” against conviction for accused persons who have pleaded guilty to the charges against them (
per
 Yong Pung How CJ in 
Teo Hee Heng v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 168
 at [7]). The courts have therefore formulated certain principles to guide the prudent exercise of this extraordinary power.
…
49    I agree with the cautious and limited exercise of the High Court’s revisionary power as stated in [46]–[47] above. This extraordinary judicial power must not be regarded or exercised as an alternative appellate route (a point which I mentioned earlier at [46] above). However, it also has to be kept in mind that Parliament has conferred this power on the High Court so as to ensure that no potential cases of serious injustice are left without a meaningful remedy or real redress. A court would fail in its constitutional duty to oversee the administration of criminal justice if it remains impassive and unresponsive to what may objectively appear to be a potentially serious miscarriage of justice …
7       In exercising my discretion not to disturb the sentence, I took into consideration the fact that the ordinary manner in which the petitioner would have gone about this, if dissatisfied with the finding of the District Judge or the sentence, would be to lodge an appeal. Whatever may have been the reason, this was not done. The petitioner submitted that an appeal was not possible “since the extent or legality of the sentence imposed by the learned District Judge is not in issue”. With respect, I see no merit in this submission. If the District Judge was wrong in not sentencing the respondent under s 33A instead of s 33, it certainly would have constituted ground for appeal. Further, this petition for criminal revision was made some one and a half months after the time limit for an appeal has expired. Even if I did not consider that this petition to exercise my revisionary power is tantamount to a back door appeal, the delay is certainly relevant. Indeed, by the time this petition came up before me, the sentence of caning had been carried out. If I were to enhance the sentence, the respondent would have been liable to a further round of caning for a further three strokes at the very least. Disturbing the sentence below would, in the circumstances, result in further injustice rather than ameliorating an injustice. As the primary objective of the petitioner was to settle the law on the Issue and it was not necessary to disturb the sentence below in order to do it, there was no good reason to interfere with the order of the District Judge.
The Issue
8       I turn now to consider the Issue. The respondent had been convicted in the District Court in October 2003 for consumption of methamphetamine under s 8(b) of the MDA and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Two years earlier, in October 2001 when the respondent was 14 years old, he was brought before a Juvenile Court and charged under s 8(b) of the MDA for consumption of methamphetamine. The Juvenile Court had made a finding of guilt and ordered him to reside in an approved school (the Singapore Boys’ Home) for 32 months. The question is whether the Juvenile Court finding is a “previous conviction” for the purposes of s 33A(1) of the MDA whereupon, in combination with the 2003 District Court conviction, the respondent would have had two previous convictions and the sentence would have to be determined in accordance with s 33A of the MDA instead of s 33.
9       The relevant parts of s 33A are as follows:
(1)    Where a person who has not less than —
…
(b)    2 previous convictions for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(
b
);
…
is convicted of an offence under section 8(
b
) for consumption of a specified drug … he shall on conviction be punished with —
(i)    imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more than 7 years; and
(ii)   not less than 3 strokes and not more than 6 strokes of the cane.
…
(5)    For the purposes of this section —
(a)    a conviction under section 8(b) by a court including a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act at —
(i)    any time on or after 1st October 1992 but before the relevant date for the consumption of a controlled drug which, on the date of any subsequent conviction, is specified in the Fourth Schedule; or
(ii)   any time on or after the relevant date for the consumption of a specified drug,
shall be deemed to be a previous conviction for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b);
(b)    a conviction under section 31(2) by a court including a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act at any time on or after 1st October 1992 shall be deemed to be a previous conviction for an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2) …
10     Save for s 33A(5), which is irrelevant for present purposes, s 33A and indeed the MDA is silent on what constitutes a “previous conviction”, and specifically on whether a Juvenile Court finding of guilt constitutes a “previous conviction”. It is therefore necessary to look at the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed)(“CYPA”) whose purposes include the establishment of a separate regime for the sentencing and treatment of children and young persons. A “child” is defined in s 2 of the CYPA as a person who is below the age of 14 years and a “young person” as one who is 14 years of age or above and below 16 years. The Juvenile Court is established under s 32 of the CYPA and its jurisdiction set out in s 33, of which subsection (1) provides that – subject to certain exceptions – no child or young person shall be charged with or tried for any offence by a court of summary jurisdiction except a Juvenile Court. The exceptions are found in subsection 2 (offences triable only in the High Court shall be tried there unless the Public Prosecutor applies to the Juvenile Court with the consent of the legal representative of the child or young person), subsection 3 (joint trial with a person who has attained the age of 16 years) and subsection 4 (where age is discovered in the course of proceedings). Section 35 places restrictions on the publication of proceedings in the Juvenile Court and prohibits disclosure of any information that may lead to the identification of the child or young person concerned in the proceedings. Section 37 limits the scope of punishment that may be imposed by a Juvenile Court: a child may not be sentenced to imprisonment and a young person may not be sentenced to imprisonment “unless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a place of detention or approved school”. Further, a Juvenile Court does not have power to sentence a child or young person to corporal punishment – only the High Court may do so; s 37(3). The following provisions are relevant to the determination of the Issue and I set them out in full below:
Removal of disqualification or disability on conviction
36.    A conviction or finding of guilt of a child or young person shall be disregarded for the purposes of any Act under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon convicted persons.
Words “conviction” and “sentence” not to be used
41. —(1) The words “conviction” and “sentence” shall cease to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by a Juvenile Court.
(2)    Any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of a child or young person, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.
11     I first consider s 41 of the CYPA. Subsection (1) thereof mandates that the terms “conviction” and “sentence” shall cease to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by a Juvenile Court. The intention behind this is clear from the Children and Young Persons Bill introduced on 16 February 1949 (Supplement No 9), in which the objects and reasons statement had the following in relation to cl 55 of the Bill which is the equivalent provision to s 41 of the CYPA:
By clause 55 the terms “conviction” and “sentence” are no longer to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by Juvenile Courts, the expressions “finding of guilt” and “order made upon finding of guilt” are substituted for them.
12     It is apparent that the legislature intended that children and young persons who have been charged in a Juvenile Court and found guilty of an offence should not be stigmatised by having a conviction to his name or considered to have been sentenced for an office. That the legislature did not intend, in this section, to go further than that is seen in s 41(2), which provides that “[a]ny reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of a child or young person, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt”. Section 33A of the MDA is a written law which contains a reference to a person convicted of an offence. Section 41(2) would operate to construe such reference as including a reference to a finding of guilt in the Juvenile Court.
13     I turn to consider s 36 of the CYPA which provides that a finding of guilt of a child or young person “shall be disregarded for the purposes of any Act under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon convicted persons”. The question is whether s 33A of the MDA imposes a “disqualification or disability” upon convicted persons. The respondent submitted that the provision for enhanced punishment for repeat offenders in s 33A amounts to a “disqualification or disability imposed upon convicted persons” within the meaning of s 36 of the CYPA. The petitioner submitted that it is clearly not a “disqualification or disability”.
14     It would be useful to consider situations which clearly fall within the contemplation of s 36 of the CYPA. Some legislation provide that a person who is convicted of an offence is disqualified from holding office, 
eg
 Art 45 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) imposes a five year disqualification from being a Member of Parliament. Other legislation impose restrictions on employment, 
eg
 s 78(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) in relation to employment by a solicitor and s 59(1) of the Accountants Act (Cap 2, 2005 Rev Ed) in relation to employment by a public accountant. These situations are quite clearly a “disqualification or disability imposed upon convicted persons” and s 36 of the CYPA operates to remove the effect of those provisions in the case of a person who is the subject of a finding of guilt in a Juvenile Court.
15     It is not immediately obvious that a provision for enhanced punishment of repeat offenders such as s 33A of the MDA falls within the scope of the words “disqualification or disability”. Insofar as the word “disqualification” is concerned, s 33A does not disqualify the person from anything. The next question is whether it imposes a “disability”. The ordinary meaning of that word also does not suggest that it does. An examination of the earlier incarnation of the CYPA, namely the Children and Young Persons Ordinance 1949 (“the Ordinance”) throws much illumination on the question. In the Ordinance, s 50 and s 55 are 
in pari materia
, respectively, with s 36 and s 41 of the CYPA. The Ordinance contains a provision, s 72, of which there is no longer an equivalent in the CYPA, and which provides as follows:
(1)    Where a child or young person is found guilty of an offence and is released under a probation order, the finding of guilt for that offence shall be disregarded for the purposes of any written law by or under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon persons found guilty, or by or under which provision is made for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guilt:
Provided that if the probationer is subsequently sentenced for the original offence, this section shall cease to apply in respect of that offence, and he shall be deemed, for the purpose of any such written law imposing a disqualification or disability, to have been found guilty on the date of sentence.
(2)    Where a person is released on probation without the Court having proceeded to a finding of guilt, and he is subsequently found guilty and sentenced for the original offence, then he shall be deemed, for the purpose of any written law by or under which any disqualification is imposed upon persons found guilty, or by or under which provision is made for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guilty, to have been found guilty on the date of such finding of guilt and sentence.
[emphasis added]
16     It can be seen that under s 72 of the Ordinance, where probation is ordered, the offence is to be disregarded for the purposes of any written law that imposes:
(a)     any disqualification or disability upon a person found guilty of an offence; and
(b)     a different penalty for a repeat offender.
The words “different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guilt”, which form limb (b) above, are not found in s 50 of the Ordinance. It is clear that the policy in the Ordinance is that, in relation to a person who has a finding of guilt made against him by a Juvenile Court, such finding of guilt shall be disregarded for the purposes of any written law under which any disqualification or disability is imposed (s 55 of the Ordinance), but if that person has been released under a probation order, such finding of guilt shall also be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which makes provision for a different penalty in respect of a repeat offender (s 72 of the Ordinance).
17     Section 72 was reincarnated in quite a different form in s 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed)(“POA”). Section 11 of the POA states as follows:
Effects of probation and discharge
.
11
.—(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, a conviction for an offence for which an order is made under this Act placing the offender on probation or discharging him absolutely or conditionally shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the foregoing provisions of this Act:
Provided that where an offender, being not less than 16 years of age at the time of his conviction for an offence for which he is placed on probation or conditionally discharged as aforesaid, is subsequently sentenced under this Act for that offence, this subsection shall cease to apply to the conviction.
(2)    Without prejudice to subsection (1), the conviction of an offender who is placed on probation or discharged absolutely or conditionally as aforesaid shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability.
(3)    Subsections (1) and (2) shall not affect —
(a)    any right of any such offender to appeal against his conviction, or to rely thereon in bar of any subsequent proceedings for the same offence; or
(b)    the revesting or restoration of any property in consequence of any order made on the conviction of any such offender.
Under s 11 of the POA, a probation order will still have the same effect as s 72 of the Ordinance, although the manner in which s 11 is drafted could entail wider consequences.
18     I return to s 50 of the Ordinance. Unlike s 72 of the Ordinance, s 50 does not contain the second limb relating to “different penalty” for repeat offenders and in view of the clear dichotomy in s 72, the words “disqualification or disability” in s 50 cannot incorporate the meaning contained in the second limb of s 72. This position could not have been altered when s 50 of the Ordinance was re-enacted as s 36 of the CYPA in substantially the same terms. Accordingly, s 36 of the CYPA has no effect on any provision in any act that makes provision for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence. Section 33A of the MDA is one such provision.
19     For these reasons, I hold that a finding of guilt made by a Juvenile Court is a conviction for the purposes of s 33A of the MDA. However, if the child or young person who is the subject of such a finding of guilt has been released under a probation order or had been discharged absolutely or conditionally, s 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act would operate to deem such finding of guilt not to be a conviction for the purposes of s 33A of the MDA.",2009-08-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Formal
judgment of appellate court—Mere mention of dissenting opinion—Not specifying
grounds of dissent—Section 1023 Cr. C.—Subsection 6 of section 1013 Cr. C.—21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14.

The appellant was convicted under subsection
(a) of s. 415 Cr. C. Upon
appeal, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court, the dissent of
one judge being merely mentioned in the formal judgment. Under a recent
amendment (s. 14 of c. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), subsection 6 was added to s. 1013
Cr. C. providing that, in case of a dissenting opinion, the formal judgment
should specify the grounds in . law on which such dissent was based. The Crown
contended that, owing to the failure of the appellate court so to specify the
grounds of dissent, an appeal to this Court was not open to the appellant.

Held that this
Court had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The only section of the
Criminal Code  dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023 , under which the fact
that there has been a dissent on a question of law is the sole condition for
the foundation of its jurisdiction: the circumstance that the grounds of
dissent are not specified in the formal judgment of the appellate court does
not avoid the fact of there having been a dissent, which is the only
requirement contained in section 1023  Cr. C.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by the Court of King’s
Bench, criminal side.

The appellant was convicted of the following
offence: Being president and general manager of a company called

[Page 695]

Rayon Trimmings Limited, which company had
been declared insolvent and was being wound up, he has, during the year
preceding the winding up order of the company, committed the following
indictable offence, to wit: “Acting in his capacity of president and general
manager, with intent to defraud, he did destroy, alter, mutilate and/or falsify
the books, papers, writings, valuable securities and documents belonging to the
Rayon Trimmings Limited, and/or concur in the same being done.” This is an
offence against subsection (a) of section 415  of the Criminal Code . The
accused had also been found guilty of an offence under section 417  of the
Criminal Code , but his appeal was unanimously allowed on this last conviction
by the appellate court. The Crown contended that the appeal to this Court
should be dismissed, because the judgment of the appellate court was not
rendered in accordance with section 1013  of the Criminal Code  as amended. In
1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14, subsection (6) was added to 1013 of the
Criminal Code  reading as follows: “Whenever an appeal under this section is
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and any judge of such Court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Court, the formal judgment of the
Court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.”

The formal judgment of the appellate court
did not specify the grounds in law on which the Honourable Judge Howard was
dissenting: it merely stated that Howard J. was dissenting.

On the appeal to this Court, it was held that
the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant’s
appeal. On the merits of the appeal this Court held that there was evidence on
which it could well be found that the appellant was guilty.

Lucien Gendron K.C. and Moses Doctor for
the appellant.

Gérald Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment follows:

The Court:—The appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of section
415  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 696]

Upon appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the
majority of the Court of King’s Bench, but Mr. Justice Howard dissented. In the
formal judgment of the Court, the dissent is merely referred to as follows:

This is the judgment of this Court, Mr. Justice
Howard dissenting.

Under a recent amendment (sec. 14 of s. 28 of
21-22 Geo. V), the following subsection was added to section 1013  of the
Criminal Code :

(6) Whenever an appeal under this section
is dismissed by the Court of Appeal and any judge of such court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the
court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.

In this case, the formal judgment does not
specify the grounds on which the dissent of Mr. Justice Howard is based, and
the Attorney-General, invoking former judgments of this Court (Davis v. The
King)[1]; Gouin
v. The King[2], and De
Bortoliv. The King[3]),
contends that, owing to the failure so to specify the grounds of dissent, an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.

We are of opinion that such contention cannot be
up-held. The only section of the Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023. It gives to

any person convicted of any indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section
1013  (the right of appealing) against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The fact that there has been dissent on a
question of law is therefore the only requirement.

In the Davis case1 and in
the others referred to by the Crown, upon the state of the law as it then was,
no dissenting judgment could be legally pronounced, unless the court of appeal
directed to the contrary, and unless the direction was plainly “evidenced by
the order of the Court” (Gouin v. The King[4]); and this Court held that dissenting
opinions expressed contrary to the prohibition of the statute should be treated
as non-existent—the consequence being that there was to be found, in the
record, no dissent as a result of which the right of appeal could operate under
section 1023 of the Code.

     REGINA v BRADLEY JOHN McKENDRICK 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 16 October 1997. On that occasion the applicant was sentenced, having been convicted by his Honour after a trial without jury, to a total term of two years and eight months penal servitude comprising a minimum term component of two years specified to commence on 19 September 1997 and to expire on 18 September 1999. The sole matter raised for deliberation on behalf of the applicant is the question of parity with sentences received by co-offenders and one co-offender in particular.  2 The offence in respect of which the applicant was an accessory before the fact was a robbery which took place upon a public street when a female employee of a Mobil service station and convenience store was on the way to the bank with a little under $5,000 takings. The victim was an employee of such an establishment at Ashfield and the applicant was the manager of a similar facility at Burwood; hence, he was able to give information as to the likely amount of money that was being taken to the bank, the address of the bank, the expected times of arrival and other information which would enable the crime to be carried out.3 The crime was, in fact, carried out by a man called Sljivar. Two other participants were a man called Shaitly and a woman called Thompson. For present purposes one can ignore the participation of Thompson who was, in fact, charged as an accessory after the fact. Shaitly was also charged, like the applicant, with being an accessory before the fact.4 The three co-offenders were variously dealt with before Graham DCJ. Grogan DCJ was advised of the outcome of the proceedings concerning them. He came to the conclusion, which he expressed, that the question of parity did not arise. By that I understood his Honour to be saying he did not feel questions of parity obliged him to make any particular reference for quantifying his sentence, to what had been received by the co-offenders.5 There were undoubted differences between the applicant and Sljivar and Shaitly. Both of the latter pleaded guilty. Sljivar gave assistance to the extent of giving evidence in the case against the applicant. Shaitly was said to be entitled not only to a discount of appropriate sentence for his plea of guilty but also for matters taken into account pursuant to s 442B of the Crimes Act. It would appear that whatever was the focus of the matters taken into account under that provision, they had been raised in other proceedings in the District Court but the sentencing Judge dealing with his offence of accessory before the fact to robbery came to the conclusion that there was a continuing benefit to authority which ought to be reflected. Accordingly, I would comment that it is easy to see how Grogan DCJ came to the conclusion that the matter of parity could be put to one side, as it were.6 We have, however, today been taken to the record, in particular, of the offender Shaitly. It should be commented that the applicant had no significant past record, whereas Shaitly, in particular, had a considerable record and at about the time of the current offence was directly before courts for matters of some seriousness. It is unnecessary to recapitulate all the details of Shaitly's forensic excursions. It was submitted by counsel that analysis showed that Shaitly, in fact, served but four months and eight days specifically referrable to his participation in this offence. 7 Mr Dawe of Queen's Counsel for the Crown very fairly has indicated to the Court that he cannot dispute the arithmetic which leads to that conclusion and he has acknowledged that if it be the fact that Shaitly has served but four months and eight days in reference to his participation, then the contrast between that and the term of two years and eight months imposed upon the applicant, including the minimum term component of two years, would be likely to provoke intervention by this Court.8 The issue of parity is governed by well-known authority, including The Queen v Lowe and the recent judgments in the High Court in The Queen v Postiglione. It is unnecessary for present purposes to engage in an analysis of either of those cases. 9 In my view it is apparent that although the participation in the offence of the applicant and Shaitly were different and although Shaitly was entitled to discounts for the reasons which I have mentioned, the yawning gap between the sentence he has been required to serve and that required to be served by Shaitly is such that it should be concluded that the applicant is entitled to harbour a justified sense of grievance by reason of the lenience which was received by Shaitly. Therefore, in my view this Court ought intervene. It will be observed that the minimum term element of the applicant's sentence has less than six months to run. At the outset of proceedings, inquiry was made as to why there had been such a long delay in this matter coming before the Court and we were informed that the delay was as a consequence of the inability to obtain necessary transcript from courts below. It is common ground that the significant delay does not result from any action by the applicant. 10 The minimum term to serve under the current sentence has been served to the extent of in excess of 18 months. Although I regard the participation of the applicant, in effect, targeting a fellow employee for robbery on her way to the bank, as a matter requiring significant punishment I am unable to conclude that as a matter of parity the applicant should serve by way of minimum term any longer than he has already served. 11 For the reasons that I have sketched I have come to the conclusion that the following order should be made:-12 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted.13 The appeal be allowed.14 The sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of two years penal servitude to consist of a minimum term of 18 months commencing on 19 September 1997 and expiring on 18 March 1999.15 I would direct that the applicant be released to parole with effect from 18 March 1999 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 16 BELL J: I agree.17 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I proposed.

38,3029864,R v Hejabian [2016] NSWSC 1692,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN AJ: The accused, Shahram Hejabian, has been found guilty of the murder of Nouha Salame between 18 and 21 April 2014 at Doonside. He stands for sentence for that offence. At some time between those dates he killed Ms Salame, with whom he had been in relationship, and attempted to kill himself. In the manner in which the trial was conducted, the only issue was whether he had available to him the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. To understand this event, it is necessary to sketch some background.
	
	
	The accused was born in Iran on 5 July 1976. Accordingly, he was 37 years old at the time of the offence and is now 40. He was of the Bahai faith, and from his youth in Iran he suffered discrimination, abuse and violence because of his religion. He married in Iran but, as a result of this persecution, he and his wife took refuge in Turkey. He was then in his early twenties. They remained in that country until travelling to Australia in 2001, he being accepted as a refugee.
	
	
	He and his wife had a son but, within months of arriving in Australia, they separated. They were divorced in 2004. It seems that life was not easy for him during this period. He was prevented from seeing his son, and he perceived difficulties in obtaining accommodation and social security benefits. He felt that he had received no help and support here, despite his refugee status. Notwithstanding his fears about life in Iran, he returned to that country.
	
	
	There he remarried. In 2005 he and his second wife returned to Australia, where his family had also settled. Unfortunately, his second wife suffered from schizophrenia. She was given to episodes of self-harm and spent periods in hospital for psychiatric treatment. He decided that he should look after her as she was his wife and was dependent upon him. He became her carer. All this caused him considerable, ongoing stress. From 2011, he underwent psychological and psychiatric treatment, having been diagnosed with long standing post traumatic stress disorder and depression. It would appear that these conditions had their origin in his experience of persecution in Iran, but were maintained and heightened by the effects upon him of his wife’s mental illness.
	
	
	It was in or about 2010 that the accused met Ms Salame, the deceased, and a relationship between them developed. However, they did not live together. At the time of the murder she was living at Mt Druitt and he at Doonside. He had been living at that address with his second wife but from time to time she was absent during periods of hospitalisation. Some months before the murder, she had been placed permanently in a mental health facility.
	
	
	At the trial, relatives and friends of the deceased, and the brother of the accused, gave evidence of their observations of his relationship with her. As one might expect, those observations varied but what emerged from that evidence, for the most part, was a troubled relationship. The accused himself gave various accounts of the relationship to health professionals with whom he came into contact after his arrest. This included two forensic psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Richard Furst, who gave evidence on the issue of substantial impairment. There were significant inconsistencies in those accounts, but I do not find it necessary to examine them for present purposes.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the accused became very emotionally dependent upon the deceased and, as the Crown Prosecutor put it in submissions on sentence, saw her as his saviour in a future which otherwise appeared devoid of hope. He wanted her to marry him but, no doubt understandably, that was not a course to which she was prepared to commit herself. The deceased’s eldest daughter, Sarah Salame, described his behaviour in the weeks leading up to the murder as “obsessive”. He would call the deceased on her mobile phone “multiple times”, and arrive at her home unannounced. The deceased was not happy about this because, whilst Sarah was aware of the relationship, her younger siblings were not.
	
	
	Also some months before the murder, he told the deceased that if she left him, he would kill her and himself. It seems that she did not take this seriously, and the Crown Prosecutor did not rely upon it as evidence that the murder was premeditated. Nevertheless, it is an indication of the intensity of his feelings for the deceased and the extent of his emotional dependence upon her.
	
	
	The deceased was killed some time between the afternoon of 19 April 2014, when she spoke to a friend on the phone, and the evening of 21 April 2014, when police gained entry to the home at Doonside and found the body of the deceased in the hallway and the accused, barely conscious, in a bedroom. It may well have occurred later on 19 April, but that cannot be firmly established by the evidence. The accused also gave accounts of what happened to health professionals and to Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, which are inconsistent and much of which I do not accept. Whether these accounts were deliberate falsehoods or the result of impaired memory, or both, I find unnecessary to decide. His counsel, Mr Austin, did not rely upon any of those accounts but, rather, on observations at the crime scene which included, importantly, some writing on a wall which amounted to a suicide note.
	
	
	Dr Kendall Bailey conducted an autopsy on the deceased. She noted two lacerations on her scalp, under one of which there were two skull fractures. The nature of the lacerations conveyed that they had been caused by an implement like a hammer. She also noted abrasions on her neck and face and petechial haemorrhages in her eyes and on the skin around the eyes. She saw these injuries as the result of compression of the neck. She thought it unlikely that the head injuries alone would have caused death, and concluded that it was the result of the combined effects of those injuries and neck compression.
	
	
	Observation of the brain disclosed signs that there had been some deprivation of oxygen, which could cause asphyxia. Dr Bailey could not say whether the neck compression produced death or merely an altered level of consciousness, but she saw it as a contributing factor. She said that the deceased may have been unconscious from a combination of the head injuries and neck compression, and then been unable to protect her airway, leading to asphyxia.
	
	
	The deceased was found lying on her back and Dr Bailey considered the possibility that, in an unconscious state, her tongue had blocked her airway. She agreed that the airway could be blocked in that manner, but the effect of her evidence was that in the present case that would not have caused asphyxiation in the absence of neck compression. It could not explain the facial and neck abrasions and, in particular, the petechial haemorrhages.
	
	
	Evidence was also given by Dr Peter Ellis, a forensic pathologist, who had been supplied with Dr Bailey’s report and the crime scene evidence. Put shortly, he was of the view that the head injuries would have been sufficient of themselves to cause death. He doubted that any neck compression would have contributed to the death, as there was no injury to the underlying tissues or structures of the neck. He saw Dr Bailey’s observations as “very supportive” of asphyxia, but thought it more likely that it was the result of some obstruction to breathing “by interference with maybe the nose and mouth, in some form of suffocation.” He shared Dr Bailey’s view that the deceased would be unlikely to have asphyxiated simply by her tongue falling back and blocking her airway. He saw the petechial haemorrhages as “more indicative of a more active interference with breathing.”
	
	
	The significance of this evidence is its bearing upon whether the accused intended to kill the deceased rather than to cause her grievous bodily harm. Mr Austin submitted that I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased’s asphyxiation was the result of a deliberate act of the accused. In my view, however, the expert evidence admits of no other conclusion. I am satisfied that, apart from the blows to the deceased’s head, the accused did an act leading to her asphyxiation. The conclusion that he intended to kill her is inescapable.
	
	
	This is not to say that the killing was planned. A consistent thread in the various accounts of the accused was that he and the deceased had a heated argument. I accept that that was the case and, whatever its precise terms might have been, it was directed to his perception of their failing relationship. As I have said, on the wall of the bedroom in which the accused was found was writing by him in Persian. A Persian interpreter gave evidence of her translation of that writing. There was no punctuation in it, but she supplied some punctuation in the translation so as to make it more readily understood.
	
	
	The message began with the accused’s complaints about his treatment in Australia, and referred to the breakdown of his relationship with his first wife and the difficulties of coping with the mental illness of his second wife. Relevantly, it continued:
	


Within this time I met this lady. It is about 4 years that we have a relationship. We have even had sex. Within these 4 years this lady has made me many promises that she will make me a happy man. I am an emotional and weak person. From feelings point of view this lady has broken my heart. Within this period she kept changing her words. She would say I love you but she did not. She used me in every ways. She always lied to her children and first husband. When she was speaking with them on the phone she always lied. She said she would marry me. I said okay. Whatever she said I said okay because I really love her. But she always played with my feelings. She put so much emotional pressure on me. She caused me much torment. She left me a year ago. No matter how much I begged her she didn’t have mercy on me. I fell into a sick bed for 3 months. I had much stress and anxiety and fear of everything in this prostitute bearing country. Forgive me for having written this but the reality is that one disaster happened to me that was due to severe stress. I do not know what else to say.


	
	The underlined words and figures in that passage are as they appeared in the writing on the wall. The message continued by expressing the accused’s desire that his mother be told not to be sad for him, and an assertion that he loved his family. It ended with the word “Farewell”. Insofar as that passage suggests that the deceased behaved deceitfully, or set out to cause the accused emotional distress, I have no reason to believe that that was so. I do, however, accept that that was his perception.
	
	
	As I have said, the accused was found in the bedroom barely conscious. He had a number of pressure sores on the right side of his body, conveying that he had been lying on the floor on that side for a lengthy period. Ambulance officers conveyed him to Westmead Hospital.
	
	
	Pharmacological evidence established that he had taken a significant overdose of Mirtazapine tablets, which he had been prescribed for his depression, and a substantial overdose of Clozapine tablets, an anti-psychotic drug which would have been prescribed for his wife. Medical evidence established that he was likely to have become unconscious following his ingestion of this medication and that he had been lying in the same position long enough to have contracted a condition known as Rhabdomyolysis. This arises from muscle damage, causing the release of a particular protein which, in turn, causes kidney failure. Eventually, if untreated, it can be fatal. It has left the accused with enduring problems with mobility, requiring the use of a wheelchair.
	
	
	Clearly, this was a serious suicide attempt on the part of the accused. The Crown Prosecutor accepted as much.
	
	
	By reference to the terms of s 23A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the defence of substantial impairment was presented on the basis that at the relevant time the accused’s ability to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, that impairment being so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. As to the underlying condition, both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt reviewed the history which I have outlined and records of the accused’s psychiatric and psychological treatment, both before the murder and at Westmead Hospital and in custody after his arrest. Both psychiatrists diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and were of the view that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the relevant time.
	
	
	Whether that amounted to an impairment sufficient to warrant the reduction of murder to manslaughter was a matter which they properly left to the decision of the jury. In my view, it was probably upon that issue, involving the application of community standards, that the defence failed.
	
	
	However that may be, I am satisfied that the accused had lost self control at the time he killed the deceased and that his mental illness was a significant factor contributing to his conduct. This was an uncharacteristic episode of serious violence, there being no evidence of any other violence on his part during the relationship. As Dr Furst observed, his state of mind is best divined from the message he wrote on the wall and his serious attempt to end his own life. Accordingly, in the light of a long line of authority on this issue, his moral culpability for his actions is reduced and the need for his sentence to reflect the consideration of general deterrence is moderated. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the principles emerging from those cases dealing with the bearing of mental illness on sentence are applicable here.
	
	
	That said, the offence remains a serious one of its kind and, while taking into account the accused’s mental illness, the sentence I pass must reflect an appropriate measure of denunciation and deterrence. The crime of murder carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. It is not suggested that the present case falls into the worst category calling for the imposition of the maximum sentence, and the accused’s background, the circumstances of the offence as I have found them, and his otherwise favourable subjective case to which I shall refer, justify a significant departure from the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	I received a victim impact statement from the deceased’s daughter, Sarah Salame, which she read to the court. That was no easy task but, notwithstanding her obvious distress, she did so with courage. The statement expressed eloquently the outrage and grief of herself, her siblings and her extended family, and the enduring effects upon all of them of this tragic event. I expressed my deepest sympathy to Ms Salame and her family members at the sentence hearing, and I do so again now. I have regard to that statement in accordance with prevailing authority.
	
	
	The accused has a brief criminal history. In 2002 he was convicted and placed on bonds for offences of common assault and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, those offences relating to his first wife. I have no details of the offences but, while the common assault suggests an episode of domestic violence, I place little significance on them given their age and the lenient outcome. In 2013 he was again convicted and placed on a bond for offences of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16. I place little significance upon those offences also, but regard must be had to the fact that he was subject to that bond at the time of the murder.
	
	
	The accused will require ongoing treatment for his mental illness while in custody, and I take into account the fact that that mental illness, together with his physical disability arising from his suicide attempt, will make his time in custody more difficult. As I have said, there was no history of violence in his relationship with the deceased prior to the murder and I consider that, with appropriate treatment and supervision, his prospects of rehabilitation are favourable. As I have said, I expect that he will continue to undergo treatment while in custody and, no doubt, it is important that a treatment plan be developed and maintained upon his release. With those safeguards in place, I think it unlikely that he would re-offend in this way.
	
	
	Mr Austin submitted that I should find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. However, the sentence I impose must be lengthy and, in my view, the period of parole eligibility afforded by the statutory proportion would be sufficient to foster the accused’s rehabilitation through supervision and the continuing sanction of parole.
	
	
	Taking all these factors into account, I have decided that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 21 years. Applying the statutory proportion, the non-parole period is 15 years and 9 months. As I have said, the accused was conveyed to Westmead Hospital on 21 April 2014 and, although he was not formally arrested until two days later, he has been effectively in custody since that date. Accordingly, the sentence will date from 21 April 2014.
	
	
	Shahram Hejabian, for the murder of Nouha Salame you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months, commencing on 21 April 2014 and expiring on 20 January 2030, and a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months, commencing on 21 January 2030 and expiring on 20 April 2035. You will be eligible for release on parole on 21 January 2030.

                    A police investigation called
“Operation Piranha” revealed that D was operating a large drug‑trafficking
network in the Montréal area.  The wiretap and physical surveillance
eventually led to two large seizures of cocaine in October of 2005, from the
homes of two accomplices of D.  Following the seizures, D turned to V for
assistance when his previous source refused to supply him with additional
cocaine.  It was then that V, who previously had purchased drugs from D, began
to supply D instead.  This arrangement ended in March of 2006 when V was
arrested following a search of his home, where the police seized, among other
things, nine grams of cocaine, a firearm, and a large sum of cash.  The trial
judge convicted V of eight offences, including the commission of an offence for
a criminal organization (count 3), instructing the commission of an offence for
a criminal organization (count 5), and possession of cocaine for the purpose of
trafficking (count 4).  The majority of the Court of Appeal entered acquittals
for both criminal organization offences.  It found that V was not a member of a
criminal organization and had not trafficked in cocaine “for the benefit of” or
“in association with” a criminal organization.  It also quashed V’s
conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. 

                    Held:  The appeal should be
allowed for the sole purpose of setting aside V’s acquittal on count 3.

                    The Crown failed to prove that the
drugs seized bore any relation to the conspiracy of which V was a part.  Absent
that evidence, V’s conviction on the count of possession of cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking amounts to an unreasonable verdict.

                    To secure a conviction under
s. 467.13  of the Criminal Code , the Crown must prove, as a
preliminary matter, the existence of a “criminal organization”, as defined in
s. 467.1 , and membership in it.  By insisting that criminal groups be
“organized”, Parliament has made plain that some form of structure and degree of
continuity are required to engage the organized crime provisions that are part
of the exceptional regime it has established under the Criminal Code .  Courts
must not limit the scope of the provision to the stereotypical model of
organized crime.  In this case, V was an associate of D rather than a member of
his criminal organization.  V operated with a high degree of independence and
showed little or no apparent loyalty to D and his associates.  They did not
share mutual clients.  Nor did V have any real stake or financial interest in
D’s organization.  The dealings between V and D were autonomous transactions
between like‑minded criminals, each guided by their own self‑interest.
 At all times, V was only a client or supplier of the organization ― an independent opportunist.  He played no role within the organization. 

                    The fact that V was not a member
of D’s organization does not preclude a finding that V operated “in association
with” the organization when he acted as its client and its supplier contrary to
s. 467.12  of the Criminal Code .  The phrase “in association with” captures
offences that advance, at least to some degree, the interests of a criminal
organization.  It requires a connection between the predicate offence and the
organization, as opposed to simply an association between the accused and the
organization.  The Crown must also demonstrate that an accused knowingly dealt
with a criminal organization.  There is ample evidence that V knew that D was
operating a large drug‑trafficking organization ― or made himself
wilfully blind to that obvious fact.  And the evidence leaves no room for doubt
as to the required nexus between D’s organization and the offence of
trafficking committed by V.  The organization received a direct benefit from the commission
of the offence.

delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[1]                             
The respondent, Carmelo Venneri, was tried
jointly with two other alleged members of a criminal organization on a
multi-count indictment.  The trial judge convicted Venneri of eight offences,
including the commission of an offence for a criminal organization, contrary to
s. 467.12  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (count 3);
instructing the commission of an offence for a criminal organization, contrary to
s. 467.13 of the Code (count 5); and possession of cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2)  of the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19  (count 4) (2009 QCCQ 1916 (CanLII)).  

[2]                             
The Quebec Court of Appeal entered acquittals on
counts 3 and 5, which both alleged criminal organization offences.  For the
majority, Beauregard J.A. found that Venneri was not a member of a criminal
organization and had neither trafficked nor instructed anyone to traffic in
cocaine “for the benefit of” or “in association with” a criminal organization,
within the meaning of ss. 467.12 and 467.13 of the Code (2011 QCCA 1957
(CanLII)). 

[3]                             
The Court of Appeal also quashed Venneri’s
conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking (count 4). 
The majority held, correctly in my view, that the evidence failed to
demonstrate that Venneri jointly possessed the cocaine seized at the homes of
two unindicted co-conspirators in October of 2005. 

[4]                             
In dissent, Duval Hesler J.A. (as she then was) found
that the verdicts rendered by the trial judge were supported by the evidentiary
record. 

[5]                             
I agree with Beauregard J.A. that the Crown
failed to prove that Venneri was a member of a criminal organization.  Unlike
Beauregard J.A., however, I am satisfied that Venneri trafficked in cocaine “in
association with” a criminal organization, as alleged in count 3 of the
indictment. 

[6]                             
I would therefore affirm the acquittals entered
by the Court of Appeal on counts 4 and 5, but restore Venneri’s conviction on
count 3. 

II

[7]                             
The charges against Venneri arose out of a
police investigation called “Operation Piranha”, which lasted nine months and,
in March of 2006, resulted in the arrests of 23 individuals.   During the
course of the investigation, the police obtained two wiretap authorizations,
pursuant to which they intercepted over 137,750 telephone conversations.  

[8]                             
The investigation revealed that Louis-Alain
Dauphin was operating a large drug-trafficking network in the Montréal area. 
At the direction of Dauphin, an accomplice, Michael Russell, would transport
the drugs from British Columbia to Quebec, where they were then stored at the
homes of two other co-conspirators, Jean Bilodeau and Robert Marchand.  

[9]                             
The surveillance revealed as well that in the
summer and fall of 2005, Venneri regularly purchased cocaine from Dauphin for
the purpose of trafficking.  

[10]                         
The wiretap and physical surveillance eventually
led to two large seizures of cocaine in October of 2005, from the homes of
Marchand and Bilodeau.  Following the seizures, Dauphin turned to Venneri for
assistance when his previous source refused to supply him with additional
cocaine.  It was then that Venneri, who previously had purchased drugs
from Dauphin, began to supply Dauphin instead. 

[11]                         
The trial judge found that Venneri then became [translation] “an important pillar” in
securing Dauphin’s supply (para. 95).  This arrangement ended in March of 2006
when Venneri was arrested following a search of his home, where the police
seized, among other things, nine grams of cocaine, a firearm, and a large sum
of cash.   

[12]                         
The trial judge found as well that Venneri had
conspired with several others to engage in drug trafficking between July of
2005 and March of 2006.  He based this conclusion on numerous intercepted
telephone conversations, during which Venneri and others used coded language to
negotiate prices and arrange deliveries of cocaine (paras. 55-57 and 104-11).  

[13]                         
Finally, with respect to the criminal
organization offences, the trial judge concluded that Venneri was a member of
Dauphin’s organization and had instructed one of his co-accused, Jean-Daniel
Blais, to traffic in drugs on the organization’s behalf (para. 370). 

[14]                         
In the result, the trial judge convicted Venneri
of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics; trafficking in narcotics; committing an
offence for a criminal organization; possession of cocaine for the purpose of
trafficking (two counts); instructing the commission of an offence for a
criminal organization; possession of a prohibited weapon; and, possession of a
restricted firearm. 

III

[15]                         
The Crown seeks to have Venneri’s conviction on
count 4 restored. 

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal quashed that conviction on
the ground that it was unreasonable within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i)
of the Code.  I agree with that conclusion: No properly instructed jury
acting judicially could reasonably have rendered that verdict: R. v.
Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 36.

[17]                         
The only evidence linking Venneri to the drugs
seized at the homes of Marchand and Bilodeau was the presence of symbols and
expressions on the cocaine packaging that were consistent with expressions used
by Venneri in telephone conversations concerning drug deals.  But nothing
indicates that those symbols were not used in other drug transactions completely
unrelated to Venneri.  In oral argument, the Crown conceded that there were no
intercepted communications which explicitly linked Venneri to the drugs seized
in 2005.  

[18]                         
The Crown contends that Venneri’s conviction can
be upheld pursuant to s. 21(2) of the Code because possession of cocaine
was a foreseeable consequence of conspiring to traffic in cocaine.  

[19]                         
In this regard, the Crown relies on Zanini v.
The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 715, where, on the basis of s. 21(2), the accused
was found guilty of possessing housebreaking instruments.  Zanini formed a
common intention with two others to carry out a break and enter, and then
waited in a car with the motor running while his accomplices broke into the
home with a screwdriver.  The trial judge instructed the jury that they could
find the accused guilty pursuant to s. 21(2) if they found that he knew or
ought to have known that his accomplices would possess the tools necessary to
carry out their joint purpose ― the burglary they were found committing. 

[20]                         
On its facts, Zanini is plainly
distinguishable from this case.  In Zanini, there was a clear nexus
between the housebreaking instruments found on the co-conspirators and the
burglary they committed.  As the Court explained, the housebreaking instrument
in question, a screwdriver, “was in fact used to break in by the back door” (Zanini,
at p. 720).  In the present matter, no such nexus was established between the
conspiracy involving Venneri and the drugs seized from the homes of Marchand
and Bilodeau in 2005.  Venneri was not Dauphin’s only customer and the Crown
failed to prove that the drugs seized bore any relation to the conspiracy of
which he was a part.  

[21]                         
Absent that evidence, Venneri’s conviction on
count 4 amounts to an unreasonable verdict, a conclusion supported by the
absence in the judgment at trial of any reasons to support a finding that
Venneri had constructive or joint possession of the cocaine seized in 2005: see
R. v.
Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 34 and 38.  

[22]                         
The Crown also argues
that the conviction can be upheld solely on the basis of the conspiracy between
Venneri and others to traffic in cocaine.  In essence, the Crown maintains that
the ongoing communications between Venneri and other members of the conspiracy
demonstrate that he must have possessed cocaine, alone or in common with
others, at some point between July of 2005 and March of 2006.  In my view, the
Crown is not relieved of proving the elements of possession simply by
establishing the existence of a conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  

IV

[23]                         
I turn now to consider the criminal organization
offences alleged against Venneri.  

[24]                         
The Crown maintains that Venneri, as a member
of Dauphin’s organization, instructed another individual to traffic in cocaine
for the “benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with” the
organization, contrary to s. 467.13 of the Code.  Section 467.13 
provides:

                           467.13 (1)
Every person who is one of the persons who constitute a criminal
organization and who knowingly instructs, directly or indirectly, any
person to commit an offence under this or any other Act of Parliament for the
benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, the criminal
organization is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for
life.

                           (2)     In a prosecution for an offence
under subsection (1), it is not necessary for the prosecutor to prove that

                             (a)     an
offence other than the offence under subsection (1) was actually committed;

                             (b)     the
accused instructed a particular person to commit an offence; or

                             (c)     the accused knew the
identity of all of the persons who constitute the criminal organization. 

[25]                         
To secure a conviction under s. 467.13 , the
Crown must prove, as a preliminary matter, the existence of a criminal
organization and Venneri’s membership in it.  “Criminal organization” is
defined in s. 467.1  as follows:

                              467.1 (1)

                    “criminal organization” means a group, however organized, that

                                (a)     is
composed of three or more persons in or outside Canada; and

                                (b)     has
as one of its main purposes or main activities the facilitation or commission
of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would likely result in the
direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial
benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the group. 

                                It does not include a group of
persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. 

[26]                         
The parties disagree as to the degree of
organization or structure required to support a finding that a group of three
or more persons constitutes a criminal organization under the Code.  

[27]                         
Some trial courts have found that very little or
no organization is required before a group of individuals are potentially
captured by the regime: see R. v. Atkins, 2010 ONCJ 262 (CanLII); R.
v. Speak, 2005 CanLII 51121 (Ont. S.C.J.).  Others, properly in my view,
have held that while the definition must be applied “flexibly”, structure and
continuity are still important features that differentiate criminal
organizations from other groups of offenders who sometimes act in concert: see R.
v. Sharifi, [2011] O.J. No. 3985 (QL) (S.C.J.), at paras. 37 and 39; R.
v. Battista, 2011 ONSC 4771, at para. 16.  

[28]                         
In R. v. Terezakis, 2007 BCCA 384, 223
C.C.C. (3d) 344, Mackenzie J.A. explained in these terms the need for
flexibility in applying the statutory definition of “criminal organization”:

                           The
underlying reality is that criminal organizations have no incentive to conform
to any formal structure recognized in law, in part because the law will not
assist in enforcing illegal obligations or transactions.  That requires a
flexible definition that is capable of capturing criminal organizations in all
their protean forms. [para. 34]

[29]                         
I agree with Mackenzie J.A. that a flexible
approach favours the objectives of the legislative regime.  In this context,
flexibility signifies a purposive approach that eschews undue rigidity.  That
said, by insisting that criminal groups be “organized”, Parliament has made
plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity are required to
engage the organized crime provisions that are part of the exceptional regime
it has established under the Code.  

[30]                         
Qualifying “organized” in s. 467.1  by “however”
cannot, as a matter of language or logic, be taken to signify that no element
of organization is required at all.  “Organized” necessarily connotes some
form of structure and co-ordination, as appears from the definition of
“organized” in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical
Principles (6th ed. 2007), vol. 2: 

Formed into a whole with interdependent
parts; coordinated so as to form an orderly structure;
systematically arranged.  [Emphasis added; p. 2023.] 

In French, the definitions in Le Grand
Robert de la langue française (electronic version) are consistent with
this: it defines the noun “organisation” as the [translation] “[a]ction of organizing
(something); the result of such an action” and the verb “organiser” as
“[t]o give a specific structure or composition, order, or method of functioning
or administration to” (emphasis added).

[31]                         
“However” and “organized” ― the two words
read together, as they are written ― are complementary and not
contradictory. Thus, the phrase “however organized” is meant to capture
differently structured criminal organizations.  But the group must nonetheless,
at least to some degree, be organized.  Disregarding the requirement of
organization would cast a net broader than that intended by Parliament.

[32]                         
The United Nations
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2225 U.N.T.S. 275, also
suggests that some degree of structure is required of a group before the
statutory scheme is triggered.  Canada has an
obligation under the Convention to establish criminal offences which target
participation in the activities of an “organized criminal group” (see Art. 5). 
The Convention defines “organized criminal group” this way: 

                        (a)  “Organized criminal group” shall mean a
structured group of three or more persons, existing for a period of
time and acting in concert with the aim of committing
one or more serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this
Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other
material benefit; 

. . .

                        (c)  “Structured
group” shall mean a group that is not randomly formed for the immediate
commission of an offence and that does not need to have formally defined
roles for its members, continuity of its membership or a developed structure;
[Art. 2]

[33]                         
The similarities
between the definition of “criminal organization” in the Code and the
definition of “organized criminal group” in the Convention are self-evident. 
And, notably, while the Convention does not require a “developed
structure”, an “organized criminal group” must nonetheless be “structured”.  

[34]                         
Comments made by the Minister of Justice and
Attorney General of Canada during the enactment of Bill C-24 confirm that its
target was organized crime.  As the then-Minister explained:

                    One of the major initiatives of Bill C-24
addresses participation in the activities of criminal organizations in a new
and powerful way. First, we have proposed a new definition of “criminal
organization” with new offences and sentencing regimes, which will make it
easier to target and punish organized criminal activity.  [Emphasis
added.]

                    (Hon.
Anne McLellan, Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and
Human Rights, No. 11, 1st Sess., 37th Parl., May 8, 2001, at 8:45)

[35]                         
The structured nature of targeted criminal
organizations also sets them apart from criminal conspiracies: see Sharifi,
at para. 39.  Stripped of the features of continuity and structure, “organized
crime” simply becomes all serious crime committed by a group of three or more
persons for a material benefit.  Parliament has already criminalized that
activity through the offences of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and the
“common intention” provisions of the Code (see, e.g., ss. 21  and
465(1) ).  The increased penalties and stigma associated with the organized
crime regime distinguish it from these offences. 

[36]                         
Working collectively rather than alone carries
with it advantages to criminals who form or join organized groups of
like-minded felons.  Organized criminal entities thrive and expand their reach
by developing specializations and dividing labour accordingly; fostering trust
and loyalty within the organization; sharing customers, financial resources,
and insider knowledge; and, in some circumstances, developing a reputation for
violence.  A group that operates with even a minimal degree of organization
over a period of time is bound to capitalize on these advantages and acquire a
level of sophistication and expertise that poses an enhanced threat to the
surrounding community.  

[37]                         
Counsel for Venneri suggests that the criteria
outlined in R. v. Lindsay, 2005 CanLII 24240 (Ont. S.C.J.), and
considered in Battista, should be accepted by this Court as a means by
which to gauge whether a given group has the necessary attributes of a criminal
organization (see paras. 854-62).  The “common” characteristics of criminal
organizations identified in Lindsay may well be “common” to highly
sophisticated criminal entities, such as notorious motorcycle gangs, Colombian
drug cartels, and American “crime families”.  

[38]                         
Care must be taken, however, not to transform
the shared attributes of one type of criminal organization into a “checklist”
that needs to be satisfied in every case.  None of these attributes are
explicitly required by the Code, and a group that lacks them all may
nonetheless satisfy the statutory definition of “criminal organization”. 

[39]                         
The difficulty and disadvantage of setting out
what may be perceived as a prescriptive “checklist” is aptly described by Alexandra
Orlova and James Moore in the following passage: 

                    It is notable that while the definition of an
“organized criminal group” refers to some elements that characterize such
groups, other equally valid elements, frequently discussed in legal and academic
debates, are omitted.  For example, no references are made to the potential for
the utilization of violence and corruption, which are arguably some of the most
commonly utilized methods by organized criminal entities.  In part, the
omissions are understandable as it is rather difficult and arguably not that
useful to create a “check-list” definition of organized crime that incorporates
all possible elements of organized criminal groups.  The challenge of
creating a comprehensive “check-list” stems in part from the lack of
consistency between organized criminal groups as well as their constantly
changing and evolving nature as a response to changes in legitimate societal
structures. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

(“‘Umbrellas’
or ‘Building Blocks’?: Defining International Terrorism and Transnational
Organized Crime in International Law” (2005), 27 Hous. J. Int’l L. 267,
at p. 284) 

[40]                         
It is preferable by far to focus on the goal of
the legislation, which is to identify and undermine groups of three or more
persons that pose an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and
organized association of their members.  All evidence relevant to this
determination must be considered in applying the definition of “criminal
organization” adopted by Parliament.  Groups of individuals that operate on an ad
hoc basis with little or no organization cannot be said to pose the type of
increased risk contemplated by the regime.  

[41]                         
Courts must not limit the scope of the provision
to the stereotypical model of organized crime ― that is, to the highly
sophisticated, hierarchical and monopolistic model.  Some criminal entities
that do not fit the conventional paradigm of organized crime may nonetheless,
on account of their cohesiveness and endurance, pose the type of heightened
threat contemplated by the legislative scheme.  

[42]                         
In the present matter, the trial judge found
that Dauphin operated a large drug-trafficking organization in the Montréal
area.  This finding is not seriously contested.  The more contentious issue is
whether Venneri was a member of that organization, exposing him to conviction
under s. 467.13 of the Code.  In this regard, I agree with Beauregard
J.A. that Venneri was an associate of Dauphin rather than a member
of his organization.  

[43]                         
Venneri was an autonomous, albeit regular,
customer of Dauphin in the summer and fall of 2005.  But Dauphin was not his
sole supplier.  Venneri operated with a high degree of independence and showed
little or no apparent loyalty to Dauphin and his associates.  They did not
share mutual clients.  Nor did Venneri have any real stake or financial
interest in Dauphin’s organization.  These strike me as the most relevant
factors in the circumstances of this case. 

[44]                         
Moreover, Russell, Bilodeau and Marchand all took
direction from Dauphin and performed clearly defined functions. Venneri, on the
contrary, operated at arm’s length from the organization.  Nothing in the
record indicates that Dauphin exercised any measure of control over Venneri. 
While Dauphin did at times ask Venneri to provide drugs to other
sub-distributors, he did so only when Venneri was unable to sell the drugs
quickly to satisfy his debt.  In those circumstances, Dauphin was simply
diverting the drugs Venneri could not sell to a more solvent customer.   

[45]                         
Venneri’s later activity as a supplier to
Dauphin was nothing more than an arm’s length, mutually beneficial
arrangement.  Venneri did not provide Dauphin with drugs out of loyalty or
direct interest in the viability of Dauphin’s business.  Venneri simply
exploited a business opportunity brought about by Dauphin’s misfortune.  

[46]                         
In sum, the dealings between Venneri and Dauphin
were autonomous transactions between like-minded criminals, each guided by
their own self-interest.  At all times, Venneri was only a client or supplier
of the organization ― an independent opportunist.  He played no role within
the organization.  With respect, the trial judge erred in law in concluding, on
the facts as he found them, that Venneri was a member of Dauphin’s criminal
organization.

[47]                         
In the alternative, the Crown contends that even
if Venneri was not a member of Dauphin’s larger criminal organization, Venneri,
Dauphin, Gauthier and Blais constituted a separate and overlapping criminal
organization whose sole purpose was to traffic in cocaine.  

[48]                         
 I agree with Beauregard J.A. that the Crown has
failed to show that these four individuals were part of a criminal organization
within the meaning of the Code. On the evidence accepted by the trial
judge, Gauthier and Dauphin may well have operated as “a gang of two”. 
Venneri, on the other hand, appears to have acted independently and has not
been shown to have constituted, with Gauthier and Dauphin, a “gang of three”. 
Finally, the trial judge was not persuaded that Blais had conspired with
Dauphin, Russell or Venneri. 

[49]                         
The Crown’s alternative submission fails
essentially for these reasons.

V

[50]                         
The Crown contends that Venneri trafficked in
drugs “for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with”
Dauphin’s criminal organization, contrary to s. 467.12 of the Code.  

[51]                         
The fact that Venneri was not a member of
Dauphin’s organization does not preclude a conviction on this count.  And, in
my view, the evidence fully supports the trial judge’s finding that Venneri
operated “in association with” the organization when he acted as its client and
its supplier.  

[52]                         
Section 467.12 of the Code provides:

                          467.12 (1)
Every person who commits an indictable offence under this or any other Act of
Parliament for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association
with, a criminal organization is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.  

                          (2)   In
a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1), it is not necessary for the
prosecutor to prove that the accused knew the identity of any of the persons
who constitute the criminal organization. 

[53]                         
The phrase “in association with” should be
interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and statutory context.  It is
accompanied here by the terms “at the direction of” and “for the benefit of”. 
These phrases are not mutually exclusive.  On the contrary, they have a shared
purpose and will often overlap in their application. Their common objective is
to suppress organized crime.  To this end, they especially target offences that
are connected to the activities of criminal organizations and advance their
interests.

[54]                         
Considered in this light, the phrase “in
association with” captures offences that advance, at least to some degree, the
interests of a criminal organization ― even if they are neither
directed by the organization nor committed primarily for its benefit.  As
noted by Miles Hastie:

The phrase
“in association with” should capture, like its siblings, an interest of the
criminal organization in the predicate offence.  The accused need not carry out
the predicate offence exclusively for the criminal organization: the accused
may (and, as an organization member, will usually) entertain other selfish
motives.  But offences committed for wholly selfish purposes should not
generate liability.  On some level, the offence must only capture actions with
and for the criminal organization.  [Emphasis added; emphasis in original
deleted; footnote omitted.] 

(“The Separate Offence of
Committing a Crime ‘In Association with’ a Criminal Organization: Gang Symbols
and Signs of Constitutional Problems” (2010), 14 Can. Crim. L. Rev.
79, at p. 91)

 

[55]                         
The phrase “in association with” requires a
connection between the predicate offence and the organization, as opposed to
simply an association between the accused and the organization: see R.
v. Drecic, 2011 ONCA 118, 276 O.A.C. 198, at para. 3.  In R. v. Lindsay
(2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 131 (S.C.J.), aff’d 2009 ONCA 532, 245 C.C.C. (3d) 301,
the trial judge, correctly in my view, interpreted the phrase “in association
with” as follows:

                           The
phrase “in association with” is not impermissibly vague.  The phrase is
intended to apply to those persons who commit criminal offences in linkage
with a criminal organization, even though they are not formal members of
the group.  The Oxford English Dictionary (10th ed.) defines the phrase
“associate oneself with” to mean, “allow oneself to be connected with or
seen to be supportive of”.  The phrase “in association with” requires that
the accused commit a criminal offence in connection with the criminal
organization.  Whether the particular connection is sufficient to satisfy
the “in association with” requirement will be for a court to determine, based
on the facts of the case.  [Emphasis added; para. 59.]

[56]                         
As mentioned earlier, an offender may commit an
offence “in association with” a criminal organization of which the offender is
not a member.  Membership in an organization, however, remains a relevant
factor in determining whether the required nexus between the offence and the
organization has been made out (see Drecic, at para. 3). 

[57]                         
The Crown must also demonstrate that an accused knowingly
dealt with a criminal organization.  The stigma associated with the offence
requires that the accused have a subjective mens rea with respect to his
or her association with the organization (see Lindsay (2004 S.C.J.), at
para. 64). 

[58]                         
There is ample evidence that Venneri knew that
Dauphin was operating a large drug-trafficking organization ― or made
himself wilfully blind to that obvious fact.  And the evidence leaves no room
for doubt as to the required nexus between Dauphin’s organization and the
offence of trafficking committed by Venneri.  The organization received a
direct benefit from the commission of the offence.  

[59]                         
This was particularly evident after the 2005
seizures of cocaine when, as noted by the trial judge, Venneri became [translation] “an important pillar” in
terms of supply.  The evidence establishes that Dauphin was unable to secure
cocaine without the assistance of Venneri.  Manifestly, Venneri trafficked “in
association with” the organization when he secured for it a source of supply
following the 2005 seizures. 

VI

[60]                         
For all of these reasons, as stated at the
outset, I would allow the appeal for the sole purpose of setting aside
Venneri’s acquittal on count 3, and otherwise affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeal.

The Court delivered the following written judgment:—



               Aug. 18
               Mason C.J., Wilson, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ.
               
The applicant was convicted upon one count of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. He was indicted alone, three of his alleged co-conspirators having been tried and convicted in other proceedings. The case against the applicant was that he had knowingly participated in a scheme to evade the payment of income tax. Speaking in the broadest of terms, the scheme involved the acquisition of target companies with profits for the current financial year at a price which did not reflect the contingent tax liability in respect of those profits. Upon this transaction the vendor shareholders paid a fee. The companies were then stripped of their profits and ""dumped"" by steps which passed ownership and control to straw persons. The result was that the companies could not, and did not, meet their liability to pay tax.
               
At his trial the applicant admitted the existence of a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. There was no contest that a scheme of the type described above had been devised and carried out by persons alleged to be the applicant's co-conspirators, nor was there any contest that the applicant, who was an accountant, had introduced clients whose companies had been used in the scheme. There was evidence that the applicant had in relation to those companies taken part in various activities which were part of the scheme and had shared in the fee which was paid by vendor shareholders. The applicant's defence was that what he did formed no part of any scheme to engage in fraudulent conduct. His case was that at all times he believed that the companies in question would be ""treated"" rather than ""dumped"", that is to say, that they would be dealt with in a manner designed to avoid or reduce the liability to pay tax on the income which had been already earned, rather than stripped of their assets to prevent the effective collection of the tax for which they remained liable. The prosecution, on the other hand, contended that the inference to be drawn from his activities was that the applicant knew that the companies with which he was concerned were to be ""dumped"" and that he participated knowingly in the conspiracy to defraud.
               
The sole point that was argued before us arises from a direction given to the jury by the trial judge in his summing up. His Honour directed the jury to have regard first of all only to the evidence ""directly admissible"" against the applicant, that is to say, the evidence of his own acts and declarations, any acts or declarations of others which he adopted or what others did at his direction. The purpose of looking at this evidence alone was, according to the judge's direction, to determine whether there was a prima facie case that the applicant was a party to the conspiracy. If the jury were satisfied that there was prima facie proof of the applicant's participation, so the charge continued, they might then look at all the evidence, including the acts and declarations of the other conspirators, for the purpose of determining the nature and extent of the underlying agreement and for the purpose of deciding the ultimate issue of the applicant's ""guilty participation"". It is this direction which was said by the applicant to have been erroneous.
               
An appropriate starting point from which to consider the use which might be made of the acts and declarations of one co-conspirator against another is the rule of thumb referred to in Tripodi v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
  . There it was said to be an ""empirical but practical and convenient test"" that acts and declarations done or made outside the presence of an accused are not admissible against him. Practical and convenient though that test might be, it can be no more than a rule of thumb, because it is clear that it has a limited application. It represents an attempt to state in practical terms the effect of the hearsay rule although, of course, acts (other than certain acts of communication) cannot of themselves constitute hearsay and, strictly speaking, lie outside the rule. However, acts may contain an implied assertion on the part of the actor which makes it appropriate to treat evidence of those acts for some purposes as the equivalent of hearsay. A conspirator may, in the absence of another person alleged to be a co-conspirator, say or do something carrying with it the implication that the other person is involved. The statement or the act may be admissible in evidence to prove the fact of a conspiracy and, by way of admission, the participation of the maker of the statement or the actor in that conspiracy. But evidence of neither the statement nor the act should, except in the circumstances which we shall elaborate presently, be admitted against the other person to prove his participation because it would for this purpose be hearsay or the equivalent of hearsay.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R. 1, at p. 7.


               
In conspiracy cases a clear distinction is to be made between the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of each of the alleged conspirators in it. Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means and it is the fact of the agreement, or combination, to engage in a common enterprise which is the nub of the offence. This fact can seldom be proved by direct evidence of the making of an agreement and must in almost all cases be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay and is not dependent upon some circumstance to take it outside the hearsay rule, such as an implied authority making the acts and words of one the acts and words of the other.
               
Thus it was said in Tripodi 
                  
    [2]
   that proof of the crime of conspiracy ""may well consist in evidence of the separate acts of the individuals charged which, although separate acts, yet point to a common design and when considered in combination justify the conclusion that there must have been a combination such as that alleged in the indictment"". For example, it may be possible in a case of conspiracy to commit armed robbery to conclude from the fact that one accused wearing a disguise was present in a bank at the same time as another accused, similarly disguised, was waiting outside the bank in a motor vehicle with the motor running, that both were engaged in a common enterprise to rob the bank. For the purpose of reaching that conclusion it is permissible to use the acts and declarations of each, even in the absence of the other, not as proof of the truth of any assertion or implied assertion of the participation of the other, but as facts from which the combination might be inferred. Utterances for this purpose may be regarded as facts no less than acts and, indeed, in the United States are sometimes called verbal acts. In the example given it would be possible to reach the conclusion, admitting the evidence for the purpose described and considering it against each accused separately, not only that there was a conspiracy but also that each of the two accused was a participant. It was such a situation that Isaacs J. had in mind in R. and Attorney-General (Cth) v. Associated Northern Collieries (""the Coal-Vend Case"") 
    [3]
   when he pointed out that both the fact of combination and the participation of the participants may be proved by the same evidence. He said 
    [4]
  :
                      though primarily each set of acts is attributable to the person whose acts they are, and to him alone, there may be such a concurrence of time, character, direction and result as naturally to lead to the inference that these separate acts were the outcome of pre-concert, or some mutual contemporaneous engagement, or that they were themselves the manifestations of mutual consent to carry out a common purpose, thus forming as well as evidencing a combination to effect the one object towards which the separate acts are found to converge.
               




                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 6.

                         (1911) 14 C.L.R. 387.

                         (1911) 14 C.L.R., at p. 400.


               
However, it is not in all cases that evidence of the separate acts of the alleged conspirators will prove both the fact of combination and their participation. Of course, if the evidence fails to prove a combination at all then that is an end of the matter. But if it proves a combination, although not the participation of an individual alleged to be a conspirator, then the question arises whether there are circumstances in which evidence of the acts and declarations of other participants, outside the presence of the individual, may be led against him, not as separate facts from which, when combined with other facts, an inference of combination may be drawn, but as evidence of his own participation. Evidence of the acts or declarations of others led for this purpose will be led to prove the truth of the assertion or implied assertion contained in those acts or declarations. It would be excluded as hearsay or its equivalent were it not admissible upon some other basis.
               
That basis is provided in an appropriate case by the rule which states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others: Tripodi 
                  
    [5]
  . Thus anything said or done by one conspirator in pursuit of the common object may be treated as having been said or done on behalf of another conspirator. That being so, once participation in the conspiracy is established, such evidence may prove the nature and extent of the participation. The principle lying behind the rule is one of agency and the closest analogy is with partners in a partnership business. Indeed, conspirators have been described as partners in crime. The principle of agency has a particular application in cases of conspiracy where preconcert is the essence of the crime.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 7.


               
The implied authority on the part of one conspirator to act or speak on behalf of another will only arise if the latter is part of the combination. Evidence of the acts or declarations of the former may, however, be led to prove that very fact. That is where the dilemma lies in cases of conspiracy because, to assume the participation of the latter in order to admit the evidence on the basis of implied authority is to assume the very fact which is sought to be proved by that evidence. If there were no prerequisite to the admission of such evidence ""hearsay would lift itself by its own bootstraps to the level of competent evidence"": Glasser v. United States
                  
    [6]
  . In that case, Glasser, who was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, had red hair. Evidence was led of a declaration by an alleged co-conspirator in the absence of Glasser that ""he would have to see ""Red"", or send the money over to the ""redhead"", etc., in connexion with ""fixing"" cases""
                  
    [7]
  . In accordance with accepted principle, such evidence was held to be admissible ""only if there is proof aliunde that he is connected with the conspiracy""
                  
    [8]
  . That, of course, still leaves two questions. The first is the degree or standard of proof of the evidence from another source which is required. The second is whether it is for the trial judge or the jury to decide whether proof of the required standard exists.

Turning to the first question, if it is proof beyond reasonable doubt which is required, then the evidence of acts and declarations of co-conspirators led to prove the participation of an individual in the combination would be of no value in proving that fact. At most its relevance would be to show the nature and extent of the participation, once the actual participation had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. This was recognized by Street C.J. in R. v. Gunn and Howden
                  
    [9]
   where he said:In point of fact if the agreement or common purpose, which is the gist of the offence, could be proved aliunde the acts or declarations of the different parties in pursuance of the common purpose would not be required to be proved. In practice however, as is pointed out, they are almost universally put forward for the purpose of proving the conspiracy itself, and this case was no exception to that practice.
               




                         (1930) 30 S.R.(N.S.W.) 336, at p. 343.


               
Street C.J. had also said 
    [10]
  :It is laid down by the authorities that the fact of a conspiracy must be established, prima facie at least, before the acts and declarations of one can be used in evidence against the others, but this would in most cases lead to such insuperable difficulties that in practice the rule is disregarded and for the purpose of proving the conspiracy evidence is admitted of acts done by the alleged conspirators.These two passages appear not to recognize that in seeking to prove the participation of an alleged conspirator by attributing his authority to the incriminating acts or declarations of the others, it is sought to use the evidence in a manner different from that in which it may be used to establish the combination as a matter of inference. A similar attitude seems to be taken in Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed. (1963), p. 124, par. 263 where the author says that ""[o]n charges of conspiracy, the acts and declarations of each conspirator in furtherance of the common object are admissible against the rest; and it is immaterial whether the existence of the conspiracy, or the participation of the defendants be proved first, though either element is nugatory without the other"". Such statements fail to recognize the problem.



                         (1930) 30 S.R.(N.S.W.), at p. 342.


               
Often the problem will not arise in any practical way because the acts and declarations of the conspirators considered separately will establish both the fact of the combination and the participation of each of them. But that is not always the case. Nor is the problem overcome when it does arise merely by treating the evidence establishing the existence of a combination separately from the evidence of the participation of an individual in the combination. Of course, the case against each alleged conspirator must be established separately and this ultimately requires those two elements to be kept distinct. Sometimes, particularly where the existence of evidence of an individual's participation is crucial, this may dictate the order of proof. As was said in The Queen's Case
                  
    [11]
  : ""On a prosecution for a crime to be proved by conspiracy, general evidence of an existing conspiracy may in the first instance be received, as a preliminary step to that more particular evidence, by which it is to be shewn that the individual Defendants were guilty participators in such conspiracy."" But it may not be necessary or possible in many cases to call the evidence in two stages and that, apparently, is what the author of Phipson on Evidence had in mind in the passage which we have cited above.



                         (1820) 2 Brod. & B. 284, at p. 310 [129 E.R. 976, at p. 986].


               
In Reg. v. Finn and Niblock
                  
    [12]
   McPherson J., speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Queensland, referred to the passage from Phipson  and said:But that means no more than that evidence of the acts of others may be admitted to prove the existence and nature of the agreement before proof is adduced for the purpose of establishing that the accused was a party to the agreement However, when it comes to proving that a particular accused was a party to the agreement — that he participated in the conspiracy — the acts of other persons may not be relied upon. The accused must be connected with the conspiracy by evidence admissible against him according to ordinary principles of the law of evidence  Participation by the accused in the alleged conspiracy can therefore be established only by evidence of his own acts or admissions and not by the acts or admissions of others, except to the extent that they are shown to have been authorized or adopted by the accused himself. Until such participation is established, the acts of others are available only to show the existence of an agreement and its nature or terms.As we read that passage, McPherson J. was expressing the view that the participation of an individual in a conspiracy cannot be proved by evidence of things said or done by other conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy unless that participation is first proved beyond reasonable doubt by other evidence. Such a view is understandable, particularly when it is borne in mind, as it should be, that the other conspirators, whose acts and declarations in the absence of the individual are sought to be used in evidence, may not be available for cross-examination by the individual. It is a view, however, which deprives the evidence of any probative effect, other than with respect to the nature and extent of the conspiracy, by requiring as a prerequisite of its use, proof of the very thing which it is led to prove, namely, that the accused was guilty of conspiracy. The need to cut this Gordian knot has been generally recognized, although there has been no general recognition of the point at which it should be cut.

In R. v. Orton
                  
    [13]
  , a case of conspiracy, Cussen J. charged the jury that ""Each accused is entitled at the outset to have the evidence properly admissible against him considered alone, and it is only when after such evidence so considered you find him to be a party to the conspiracy, if any, that the acts of the other conspirators can be used against him""
                  
    [14]
  . This appears to require proof beyond reasonable doubt of participation before the acts and declarations of others in the absence of the particular accused may be used against him, but in Reg. v. Minuzzo and Williams
                  
    [15]
  , Young C.J. (with whom King J. agreed) doubted whether, upon a consideration of the whole of the charge, Cussen J. intended to convey to the jury that it was only after they had concluded that any alleged conspirator was guilty that they could use the evidence of the acts of the other conspirators against him. In Minuzzo and Williams itself, the Victorian Full Court held that evidence of the acts and declarations of the other accused might be used to prove the participation of an individual accused once there was prima facie evidence from another source of the individual accused's participation in the combination.

The term ""prima facie grounds"" was used by Stephen in Art. 4 of his Digest of the Law of Evidence (1876) where he said  at p. 6:
                  When two or more persons conspire together to commit any offence or actionable wrong, everything said, done, or written by any one of them in the execution or furtherance of their common purpose, is deemed to be so said, done, or written by every one, and is a relevant fact as against each of them  Evidence of acts relevant under this article may not be given until the judge is satisfied that, apart from them, there are primâ facie grounds for believing in the existence of the conspiracy.In The Indian Evidence Act 1872, which was drafted by Stephen and upon which his Digest  was based, s. 10 provides:Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done, or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.See Mirza Akbar v. King-Emperor
                  
    [16]
  . Whether Stephen drew any distinction in this context between ""prima facie grounds"" and ""reasonable ground to believe"", the latter phrase is reflected in the judgment of this Court in Tripodi 
                  
    [17]
   where it said:When the case for the prosecution is that in the commission of the crime a number of men acted in preconcert, reasonable evidence of the preconcert must be adduced before evidence of acts or words of one of the parties in furtherance of the common purpose which constitutes or forms an element of the crime becomes admissible against the other or others, that is to say of course, unless some other ground for admitting the evidence exists in the given case.

In Tripodi  the Court was speaking of the admission in evidence of the acts and declarations of others outside the presence of the accused in proof of larceny rather than conspiracy, but, as we have said, the principle upon which such evidence is admitted extends beyond cases of conspiracy. The significant distinction between conspiracy and other offences for present purposes is that indicated in Tripodi 
                  
    [18]
  , namely, that on a charge of conspiracy combination is also an element in the offence and not merely a ground for the admission of the evidence. The question does not, therefore, arise in cases other than conspiracy of the use of evidence of the acts and declarations of others to prove the combination except as evidence of separate acts from which a combination might be inferred. Once there is reasonable ground for inferring a combination in cases other than conspiracy, acts and declarations of the participants in furtherance of the common purpose may be used to prove, not the fact of participation in the combination, but the offence charged.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 6.


               
In the United States, varying standards have been applied to the proof of the participation of an alleged individual conspirator which is required to open the way for the use against him of the acts and declarations of others. They include ""substantial independent evidence"", ""a prima facie case"" and ""proof of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence"": see Marcus, Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases (1987), pp. 5-60, 5-62. In Canada the requirement is that ""a probability is raised that he [the individual accused] was a member of the conspiracy"": Reg. v. Carter
                  
    [19]
  . In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal, adopting Tripodi,  laid down a test of reasonable evidence of common intention, that is to say, of the participation of the individual: Reg. v. Humphries
                  
    [20]
  ; Reg. v. Buckton
                  
    [21]
  . It should be added that in the second of these two cases a majority took the view, for which Tripodi  is no authority, that reasonable evidence is the equivalent of proof on the balance of probabilities.

In our view, the test adopted in Tripodi  is the appropriate one. Where an accused is charged with conspiracy, evidence in the form of acts done or words uttered outside his presence by a person alleged to be a co-conspirator will only be admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy where it is established that there was a combination of the type alleged, that the acts were done or the words uttered by a participant in furtherance of its common purpose and there is reasonable evidence, apart from the acts or words, that the accused was also a participant. The words ""reasonable evidence"" have provided a standard which has been applied without difficulty in this country for some years, at least in cases where preconcert has been the basis upon which evidence has been led in cases other than conspiracy, and there is no reason to suppose that if it has provided an appropriate test in those cases, it will not do so where conspiracy is charged. If there is any difference between ""reasonable evidence"" and ""a prima facie case"", which in this context we very much doubt, then the words ""reasonable evidence"" are to be preferred providing, as they do, a test of admissibility for which no more precise expression is needed. The aim in limiting the use which might be made of a co-conspirator's acts or declarations is to exclude such evidence when its admission might operate unfairly against an accused. For this purpose, the element of discretion implicit in the term ""reasonable evidence"" is desirable.
               
The question remains whether the trial judge or the jury should ultimately determine the existence or otherwise of reasonable independent evidence of the participation of an alleged conspirator as a ground for the use against him of evidence of the acts and declarations of other conspirators which took place in his absence. Obviously the matter must be one for the determination of the trial judge in the first instance, for the evidence of acts and declarations ought not to be admitted at all for that purpose if no basis can be shown for its admission. But controversy exists over whether, even after the evidence has been admitted, the jury should be instructed that it is for them to determine whether there is reasonable independent evidence of participation and that if there is not, they ought not to use the evidence of the acts and declarations of the other conspirators for the purpose of deciding that issue.
               
In United States v. Dennis 
                  
    [22]
  , Judge Learned Hand expressed the view:The law is indeed not wholly clear as to who must decide whether such a declaration may be used; but we think that the better doctrine is that the judge is always to decide, as concededly he generally must, any issues of fact on which the competence of evidence depends, and that, if he decides it to be competent, he is to leave it to the jury to use like any other evidence, without instructing them to consider it as proof only after they too have decided a preliminary issue which alone makes it competent. Indeed, it is a practical impossibility for laymen, and for that matter for most judges, to keep their minds in the isolated compartments that this requires.One might add that the difficulty for a jury is exacerbated if the standard of proof upon which they are to decide the preliminary issue differs from the standard of proof upon which they are ultimately to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused. In Carbo v. United States 
                  
    [23]
   this difficulty was referred to:The jury is already concerned with the evidence-weighing standards involved in proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To expect them not only to compartmentalize the evidence, separating that produced by the declarations from all other, but as well to apply to the independent evidence the entirely different evidence-weighing standards required of a prima facie case, is to expect the impossible.In that case the court held that it was for the trial judge alone and not the jury to determine the admissibility of evidence of acts and declarations occurring outside the presence of an alleged conspirator. Thereafter, it was held, it was for the jury to determine whether the whole of the evidence, including the acts and declarations, established guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That appears to be the orthodox approach in the United States: see Marcus, op. cit., p. 5-70.



                         (1950) 183 F. 2d. 201, at p. 231.

                         (1963) 314 F. 2d. 718, at p. 737.


               
In Canada the opposite approach is adopted. This appears from Reg. v. Carter
                  
    [24]
   where McIntyre J. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court said:In charging the jury on this question, the trial judge should instruct them to consider whether on all the evidence they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed. If they are not satisfied, then the accused charged with participation in the conspiracy must be acquitted. If, however, they conclude that a conspiracy as alleged did exist, they must then review the evidence and decide whether, on the basis of the evidence directly receivable against the accused, a probability is raised that he was a member of the conspiracy. If this conclusion is reached, they then become entitled to apply the hearsay exception and consider evidence of the acts and declarations performed and made by the co-conspirators in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy as evidence against the accused on the issue of his guilt. This evidence, taken with the other evidence, may be sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a member of the conspiracy and that he is accordingly guilty. They should be told, however, that this ultimate determination is for them alone and that the mere fact that they have found sufficient evidence directly admissible against the accused to enable them to consider his participation in the conspiracy probable, and to apply the hearsay exception, does not make a conviction automatic. They should be clearly told that it is only after they have become satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence on both issues, that is, the existence of the conspiracy and the accused's membership in it, that they may convict, and that it is open to them, if they think it right or if they are not satisfied, to acquit the accused, even after reaching their initial determination of probable membership in the conspiracy which enabled the application of the hearsay exception.We have set out this passage in full because it demonstrates, we think, the difficulty upon that approach in formulating a charge to the jury which could readily be applied, or even understood, by them. It is an approach which has been adopted in some States in Australia — e.g., in Victoria in Minuzzo and Williams
                  
    [25]
  — and it was adopted by the trial judge in the present case, but experience suggests nothing to allay the fear that it requires the jury to undertake a task which is incapable of explanation in terms which they can comprehend. Indeed, at the risk of repetition it is instructive to set out a passage from the judgment of Young C.J. in Minuzzo and Williams
                  
    [26]
   which illustrates the complexity which must necessarily be introduced when this approach is adopted in charging a jury:An accused person is entitled to have his case considered upon the evidence admissible against him. In a conspiracy case such as the present there are three classes of evidence to be considered, namely (a) evidence of the acts and declarations of the accused whose case is being considered, (b) evidence of the acts and declarations of co-accused from which the conclusion that there was a combination might be drawn, and (c) acts and declarations of co-conspirators done or made in pursuance of the combination. Most evidence which falls within category (b) will also fall within category (c). Those two categories are not intended to be either co-extensive or mutually exclusive.Evidence in category (b) may be used in order to establish the conspiracy  Evidence in category (c), which is sometimes described as evidence in furtherance of the conspiracy, may only be used against an accused whose case is being considered once there is some evidence that that accused is connected with the conspiracy. But it is not necessary that the jury should be satisfied of the guilt of the accused before they can use evidence of category (c). Satisfaction of guilt of course requires satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. But evidence falling into category (c) can be used against an accused once prima facie proof of the accused's connection with the conspiracy has been given  The prima facie evidence which is here referred to is evidence described as directly admissible against the accused connecting him with the conspiracy alleged. By evidence directly admissible against the accused is meant in this context evidence other than the acts and declarations of the alleged co-conspirators not in the presence of the accused. Whether there is sufficient evidence directly admissible against an accused connecting him with the conspiracy to make evidence in category (c) available to be used against him is a question for the jury.
                  
Consideration of that carefully worded and clearly expressed passage as a whole inevitably leads one to doubt the proposition that the sufficiency of evidence of participation directly admissible against the accused is appropriately a question for the jury. Nothing is more likely to discredit and undermine the institution of trial by jury than a requirement that a trial judge explain to the jury matters of law in terms which are unlikely to be understood or retained by them.

In New Zealand, as in the United States, it appears that the question of the sufficiency of the independent evidence of participation of one accused to make evidence of the acts and declarations of other participants admissible against him is treated as a question for the judge alone: Reg. v. Humphries
                  
    [27]
  ; Reg. v. Buckton
                  
    [28]
  . In England, little attention seems to have been given in the cases to the problem and the position is unclear.

                         [1985] 2 N.Z.L.R. 257.


               
The preferable view is that the trial judge alone should determine the sufficiency of the independent evidence. The question is initially one of the admissibility of evidence of acts and declarations occurring outside the presence of an individual accused and for that reason a question for the trial judge. If he determines that the evidence of the acts and declarations of others is admissible to prove the participation of the accused, it is anomalous that the jury should, in effect, be required to determine the same question for themselves. To require them to do so necessitates a direction which is of unacceptable complexity.
               
It may be observed that the matters which we have discussed have little to do with the order in which the evidence may be led. It will often be difficult, if not impossible, to segregate the evidence so as to enable a ruling to be given in advance. In most cases, evidence of the acts and declarations of alleged co-conspirators will be admissible in the form of separate acts to prove the fact of combination. In those circumstances, the trial judge may postpone until all the evidence is in, his ruling whether the proof of the combination sufficiently implicates an individual accused to allow the acts and declarations of the others in his absence to be used against him as proof of his participation. If the trial judge concludes that there is insufficient independent evidence of participation of the individual for this purpose, then it will be necessary for him to instruct the jury upon the limited purpose for which the evidence of the acts and declarations of the others may be used. It may in some cases be desirable for the trial judge to give a preliminary ruling upon the depositions, but it is only when the whole of the evidence is in that a final ruling can be given. It is conceivable that there will be cases, although they are difficult to envisage, where evidence of the acts and declarations of one alleged conspirator in the absence of another is admissible only to prove the participation of that other and in those cases it may be necessary to require the prosecution to take the preliminary step of laying the ground for the admission of the evidence before admitting it at all.
               
It may be argued that there is a danger in not leaving the question of admissibility to the jury in that the jury may see the independent evidence of participation as unconvincing and yet act upon the acts and declarations of others outside the presence of the accused. Any such danger may, however, be avoided by an appropriate direction from the trial judge. It will be proper for him to tell the jury of any shortcomings in the evidence of the acts and declarations of the others including, if it is the fact, the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine the actor or maker of the statement in question and the absence of corroborative evidence. Where it is appropriate, it will not be difficult to instruct a jury that they should not conclude that an accused is guilty merely upon the say so of another nor will that be an instruction which it is difficult to follow. A direction of that kind is likely to be far more effective in safeguarding the position of an individual accused than a direction, the evidence having been let in, which a jury could not reasonably be expected to understand and apply. Moreover, any danger of the kind suggested would, in our view, be outweighed by the risk of diverting the jury's attention from the criminal standard of proof in requiring them to apply some lesser standard to determine a preliminary question.
               
In the present case the complaint is, in effect, that the trial judge followed Minuzzo and Williams rather than Finn and Niblock
                  
    [29]
  , as indeed he did. But as we have explained, the approach adopted in Finn and Niblock requires the guilt of the individual accused to be established before evidence of the acts and declarations of his co-conspirators can be used against him to prove his participation in the illegal combination. Not only does that approach render the evidence somewhat superfluous, but it is inconsistent with the decision in Tripodi  which would allow the evidence in upon a less demanding basis. The trial judge was not, therefore, wrong in principle in preferring Minuzzo and Williams to Finn and Niblock, but he ought to have decided for himself the question whether there was independent evidence of the participation of the accused in the illegal combination sufficient to let in against him evidence of the acts and declarations of the other participants in further proof of that participation. That question ought not to have been left to the jury.



                         [1985] 1 Qd R. 212.


               
There can be no question that there was reasonable independent evidence upon which it could be concluded that the applicant participated in the illegal combination, the subject of the charge against him. Indeed, there was no dispute that the activities engaged in by the applicant brought about the result that the companies concerned could not meet their liability to pay tax. The dispute centred upon the knowledge with which he engaged in those activities, in particular whether he knew that the companies were to be ""dumped"". It was not suggested before us or before the court below that there were any significant acts or declarations of the other participants in the combination occurring outside the presence of the applicant which would bear upon that issue. There was, as Thomas J. pointed out in the Court of Criminal Appeal, ""an abundance of evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the [applicant] must have known what was going on, and from which they were entitled to reject his explanations in relation to each particular transaction"". In any event, in the circumstances of this case, which were rather more straightforward than is usual in similar cases, it could hardly be said that the direction complained of operated to the disadvantage of the applicant. The conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeal that any misdirection occasioned no substantial miscarriage of justice is correct.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of rape—Evidence—Corroboration—Charge to
jury—Misdirection—New trial.

The appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario (81 C.C.C. 319) dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) appellant’s appeal
from his conviction on a charge of rape. The issue at the trial was whether or
not the complainant voluntarily consented to the intercourse. A witness, R.,
who had arrived at the scene of the alleged offence shortly after what took
place, testified to there being a “matted down” area of about 20 x 6 feet. The
complainant in her evidence had said nothing about such condition. Appellant
testified that such condition existed before what took place. In charging the jury
the trial Judge said that the evidence of R. and two other men corroborated the
complainant’s story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and he
followed by detailing certain matters of their evidence, including the
condition of the area as described by R.

Held (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The
conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.

Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: It was not
necessary that the complainant should have given some particular bit of
evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her
general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crown’s case, it was
quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when R arrived, and
the jury would not be bound to believe appellant’s evidence as to its condition
before the occurrence. But it was misdirection to say that evidence of the
matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute
corroboration of a material aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she
had not testified. And it could not be said that the misdirection had caused no
miscarriage of justice.

Per Rand J.: It was beyond controversy on the evidence
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the complainant’s story or to the case of the Crown.
The charge to the jury was, therefore, in that respect, a misdirection in law
and of such a nature that it could not be said that it might not have
influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The
reference in question in the charge to the condition of the area, having regard
to its context, related, not to any supposed statement of the complainant as to
the condition of the area which was corroborated by R., but to a reference
earlier in the charge to the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the
alleged assault, and would be so understood by the jury; and R.’s evidence as
to the condition of the area was consistent with, and could properly be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 135]

tive of, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the
struggle alleged by her to have taken place, unless it were clearly established
as a matter of fact that the struggle described by her was of such a limited
character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent
described by R., and on that question the jury, if accepting complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and was attacked, and giving due weight to
the circumstances, might well have considered that no difficulty arose, and
that was a question of fact, expressly left as such to, and entirely one for,
the jury. There was really no question of law involved in the dissent in the
Court of Appeal, but merely matters of fact, and therefore the appeal should be
quashed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction, at trial before Greene J. and a jury, on a charge of rape.

H. Freshman for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.—The conviction of the appellant Mclntyre on a charge of
rape was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Laidlaw
dissenting. As I consider there should be a new trial, I refrain from
discussing the evidence except as it may be necessary to explain my reasons for
so doing.

If the offence occurred, there is no doubt that the appellant
committed it. He admits that he had intercourse with the complainant, Eva
Pettigrew, at the time and place mentioned by her but his defence is that she
consented voluntarily. The intercourse took place about noon on a bright
Sunday, May 23rd, 1943, not far from a travelled highway in the Township of Ancaster.
The exact spot is part of the abandoned right-of-way of an electric railway
company and is described in the evidence as being about twenty feet by six feet
in area. The ground surrounding it is filled with weeds and tall grass.

After the occurrence, Eva Pettigrew complained to one or more of
the occupants of a neighbouring farm house, one of whom described the condition
of the particular

[Page 136]

area immediately thereafter as “matted down”. There would appear
to be no denial of this fact but, in view of the defence, the important
question in this connection was as to the condition of that area before the
complainant and accused had reached it. The only one who gave any evidence on
this question was the accused, who said it was “well flattened” and “the only
matted down spot in the whole territory.”

The vital point in the whole case was as to whether the
complainant consented or, if she had consented, whether such consent had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 298). The
trial judge told the jury that they “should be reluctant to convict in a case
of this kind upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant” but that “it
is within your power to do so.” He then dealt with the question “whether the
story of the complainant had been corroborated in a material aspect.” He stated
that the evidence of three people in the farm house “amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story.” He then detailed some of these aspects and stated, as one of
them:—“They described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the
grass was pressed down”, and concluded:—“So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here
to-day.” Later in his charge he said:—“She says that she did not consent, and
that she was overpowered by fear when he threatened her with bodily harm.
Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion—it is for you
gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of
some twenty feet by six.”

It was pointed out in argument before us that the trial judge was
in error in stating that three occupants of the farm house had described the
condition of this lot where the grass was pressed down. As a matter of fact
only one had referred to it but, as we may deal only with the dissent in the
Court below, I disregard this discrepancy. All that was required was that the
corroboration should be of the evidence of the complainant that the accused had
carnal knowledge of her without her consent or with consent that had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm

[Page 137]

It was not necessary that the complainant should have testified
to some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that
point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of
the Crown’s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular
area when the independent witnesses arrived, and the jury would not be bound to
believe the evidence of the accused as to its condition before the occurrence.

However, that is not what the trial judge told the jury. He
instructed them that the evidence could be taken by them as corroborating her
story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and then gave as one
aspect the condition of the area. As a matter of fact she had said nothing
about it. It was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition
of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material
aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she had not testified. It is in
this sense that I understand Mr. Justice Laidlaw’s statement:—“There could
not, of course, be corroboration, ample or otherwise, of evidence not given by
the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, and in my opinion there was a misdirection to
the jury in this matter.” In any event, later in his judgment he states:—“There
was again [referring to the same point] misdirection of such a character and
magnitude as to make the trial unfair to the appellant.”

In other parts of his charge, the trial judge had told the jury
that they were the sole judges as to what facts had been proved by the
evidence; that while it was his duty to review some of the highlights of the
evidence and to comment on them, if he saw fit, he could not pretend to review
everything and, if he expressed an opinion of the facts, they were not bound to
follow it unless their own opinion happened to be the same; and, towards the
conclusion of his charge, he stated that he did not pretend to have covered all
the evidence,—that there might be parts of it that were important that they
recalled which he had not gone over but that he was satisfied that among their
twelve joint memories they would have before them everything that was of any
real importance.

[Page 138]

These general observations, however, cannot weigh in this case
where the question of consent was of prime importance, nor does it matter that
the judge was right in pointing out other evidence which, if the jury believed
it, would warrant them in treating it as corroboration. There being
misdirection, I am unable to say that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
The fact that counsel for the accused did not object at the trial should not be
taken, in the circumstances, to indicate that the point was negligible. There
had already been one trial where the jury disagreed, and, considering the
evidence as a whole in the record before us and the importance attached to the
matted down area by the trial judge, the Crown has failed to convince me that
but for the misdirection the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Gouin
v. The King[2].

The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new
trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.—This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of rape. Appellant relies upon the dissenting judgment of Laidlaw J.A.
as establishing jurisdiction in this Court pursuant to the provisions of
section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The difference of opinion in the Court below was with regard to
certain portions of the charge of the learned trial judge. Laidlaw J.A. was of
opinion that there was material misdirection and that the Crown had not met the
onus thereby cast upon it of showing that there had been no miscarriage. The
Chief Justice of Ontario and Gillanders J.A. were of opinion that there was no
misdirection, the Chief Justice being further of the view that even if it could
be said that misdirection existed, it was quite improbable that it had had any
effect upon the result. The question in issue at the trial was as to whether or
not there had been consent on the part of the complainant, the defence being
that there had been such consent.

[Page 139]

In his charge, the learned trial judge said:

The evidence of the three gentlemen near by, the farmer Mr.
Robson, his father-in-law and his brother-in-law Scott, amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story. In other words, they painted the scene as she has told it to you.
They found the man naked. They told you how she arrived at the house with
nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described (the condition of the
area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters
they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness
box here to-day.

The complainant did not give any evidence with regard to the
condition of the area at any time. In the course of his judgment, Laidlaw J.A.,
after pointing this out, refers to the description given by complainant as to
her struggle with the appellant, and the evidence of the appellant that the
place in question was matted down at the time he and the complainant came
there. The ground of dissent was that Robson’s evidence could not amount to
corroboration of any evidence given by complainant either as to the condition
of the area or as to her struggle with the appellant, for the reason that she
had given no evidence as to the condition of the area and the extent of the
beaten down area described by Robson could not have been caused by the struggle
described by the complainant.

In considering whether or not there was misdirection in the
charge, the language of the learned trial judge is to be scrutinized to see
what the jury might reasonably be considered to have understood from it. It is,
of course, misdirection if a jury is directed to treat something as
corroboration which is not in law corroboration. In the present case, the
question is whether there is to be taken from what the learned trial judge told
the jury that the complainant had made some statement in evidence with regard
to the condition of the area which was corroborated by Robson, or whether his
charge is to be taken as referring only to her evidence as to her struggle, and
if the latter, then was the evidence of Robson in any way corroborative of it?

To my mind, the context in which the above portion of the charge
appears affords an answer to the first branch of the question.

The learned trial judge had first warned the jury that they
should be reluctant to convict upon the uncorroborated

[Page 140]

evidence of the complainant and pointed out that if they did so,
it was a very serious responsibility to assume unless her story had “been
corroborated in some material aspect”. He then proceeded to say:

It is proper that we should take just a moment to consider
as to whether the story of the complainant has been corroborated in a material
aspect. I think I need only recall to you her story as to what took place in
that gully or depression in the land that has been referred to, about her
clothes being removed, and the nature of the assault which she alleges
this man made upon her.

Then followed the portion of the charge which is objected to as
already set out above. In my opinion, the reference to the condition of the
area in the part objected to relates to the reference in the earlier part to
the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the assault which she alleged
had been made upon her and, in my opinion, would be so understood by the jury.
The learned trial judge in a subsequent passage of his charge, returns to the
relation of the complainant’s evidence as to the assault and the existence of
the beaten down area and the bearing of the one upon the other when he said:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

I am of opinion, therefore, that in the portion of the charge
objected to as first set out above, there is no implication that the learned
trial judge was telling the jury that the complainant had made any statement
with regard to the condition of the beaten down area.

There remains to be considered the second branch of the question,
namely, as to whether or not the evidence of Robson could be properly regarded
as corroborative of the evidence of the complainant with respect to the
struggle which she alleged had taken place between herself and the appellant.
To put the matter another way, while the complainant had not said that the
grass was pressed down as the result of the struggle, she had given evidence of
a struggle and Robson’s evidence as to the condition he found would be
consistent with a struggle having taken place at that point and therefore
corroborative of the evidence of the complainant unless it were clearly
established as a matter of fact that the struggle described in evidence by the

[Page 141]

complainant was of such a limited character that it could not
have been the cause of an area of the extent described by Robson. In
considering this matter, it is to be remembered that if the complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and that she was attacked was accepted by the
jury, the latter may well have considered that the complainant was not to be
held literally to her account of the struggle as she was not, in her agitated
condition in the circumstances of the attack, likely to have noted it in detail
or to have remembered it fully afterwards. Giving due weight to the
circumstances, the jury may well have considered that no difficulty arose in
this matter. In my view, this was a matter of fact entirely for the jury and no
ground is presented for interference by the court. This question of fact was
expressly left to the jury as such in the second passage of the charge to which
I have referred, namely: “Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six”. The learned dissenting judge
refers to this part of the charge but takes the view that the complainant’s
description of the struggle and the extent of the beaten down area were quite
inconsistent the one with the other. This is a finding of fact. With respect,
this was, in my opinion, a matter purely within the province of the jury.

The fact that appellant had given evidence that the area was
beaten down when he and the complainant first arrived at the place has no
relevancy to the point under discussion. The learned trial judge in the passage
of his charge referred to, was not dealing with any evidence given by the
appellant, but was dealing with the evidence of the complainant and some
aspects in which her evidence was corroborated by that of Robson. He had
already charged the jury—

There are two things that I wish to stress in regard to the
facts of the case as apart from the law: in my review I cannot pretend to
review everything; I try to assist you with a review of some of the more
important parts of the evidence, but that does not relieve you from your duty,
with your twelve joint memories, of recollecting and considering anything that
may be of importance in deciding the real issue

[Page 142]

in this case; and if I express an opinion on the facts, or
seem to express an opinion, you are not bound to follow my opinion unless your
own happens to be the same.

Viewing the evidence as I do, there is no question of law
involved in the dissent below, but merely matters of fact. I would, therefore,
quash the appeal.

RAND J.—This is an appeal by the accused from a conviction for
rape and comes here through the dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario of
Laidlaw, J.A., on a point of law.

The only issue at the trial was consent or no consent, and the
point on which the dissent arose was in relation to a portion of the judge’s
charge which dealt with corroboration.

The woman was twenty years of age and the young man eighteen. Her
story was of struggle until exhaustion, although terrified by threats of bodily
injury. The occurrence took place a short distance in the country from the city
of Hamilton in a low-lying area about twenty feet by six, over which the grass
had been beaten down until it was almost flat. Pictures of the surrounding land
indicated the grass to be fairly high and somewhat coarse and heavy.

A witness, who had reached the spot while the accused was still
there and naked, gave evidence of that state of the grass. The complainant had
not in her evidence referred to it. The accused gave a similar description of
it but added that it was in that condition when he and the complainant had come
to it. This latter feature was not challenged either in cross‑examination
or in rebuttal.

In his charge to the jury, the trial judge used the following
language:

They told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but
her skirt and jacket on, and they described the condition of the area twenty
feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box
here to-day.

And later in the charge:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

[Page 143]

In the peculiar circumstances of the case presented,
extraordinary even as told by the complainant, and in view of the sole issue
before the jury, I doubt that any single suggestion could have carried more
weight to incline the balance of their judgment than that the grass in this
spot might have shown the condition it did as a result of her struggles. So far,
however, from that being the fact, it is beyond controversy, on the evidence,
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the story of the complainant or to the case of the
Crown. It was, therefore, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that we
are quite unable to say that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching
their verdict.

The conviction should, therefore, be quashed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed, and new trial
directed.

42,2240318,Priovolidis v R [2016] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Spiros (Ross) Priovolidis, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court by Conlon DCJ on 9 June 2015.
	
	
	The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty in the Campbelltown Local Court to two driving offences. The first was the offence of failing to stop when the applicant knew or reasonably should have known the police were in pursuit and driving in a manner dangerous to others (police pursuit) contrary to s 51B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act). The maximum penalty for this offence is five years’ imprisonment. The details of the offence charged under s 51B(1) were that the applicant:
	


…. on 21 August 2013 at Campbelltown and other places in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle, … knowing that police officers were in pursuit of the said vehicle and that he was required to stop the vehicle and did not stop the vehicle and then drove the said vehicle in a manner dangerous to others. [Emphasis added].


	
	The second was the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (aggravated dangerous driving) contrary to s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 11 years’ imprisonment. The details of the offence charged under s 52A(4) were that the applicant:
	


….on 21 August 2013 at St Andrews and other places in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle… when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Charles HOVAREAU and at the time of impact the said Ross PRIOVOLIDIS was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons in circumstances of aggravation, namely the said Ross PRIOVOLIDIS was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by a Police officer. [Emphasis added].


	
	The sentences imposed by his Honour were as follows:
	



	
	In respect of the police pursuit offence – 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013 and to expire on 20 February 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the aggravated dangerous driving offence – a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 21 February 2014 and to expire on 20 February 2017 with an additional term of three years, to expire on 20 February 2020.
	



	
	In sentencing for the aggravated dangerous driving offence the judge took into account, at the request of the applicant, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act), the applicant’s guilt in respect of a further offence listed on a Form 1 document, namely dishonestly possess interfered with unique identifier (vehicle identification number) contrary to s 154I(1) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The applicant was also sentenced on two related offences which had been referred to the District Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), namely an offence of drive while disqualified, contrary to s 54(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), and taking a conveyance without consent of the owner, contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. On the former, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 6 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013 and on the latter, a fixed term of 12 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013.
	
	
	The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months with a total term of 6 years and 6 months.
	
	
	The sole proposed ground of appeal is that his Honour erred by imposing double punishment upon the applicant.

(d)    …

Circumstances of the offences


	
	The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of the Crown’s statement of facts which had been agreed by the parties. The following summary is taken from his Honour’s findings on sentence, which were not challenged on appeal.
	
	
	The applicant was disqualified from driving on 5 January 1996. Between October 1996 and November 2012 he was convicted of numerous offences of drive whilst disqualified and other speeding and reckless or dangerous driving offences. The cumulative effect of those sentences is that the applicant will remain disqualified for 2 years from 14 December 2080.
	
	
	On 21 August 2013 at about 10.42am, police in an unmarked highway patrol vehicle observed the applicant driving a green Ford XR8 sedan in Railway Street, Campbelltown. This vehicle had been stolen a year earlier. It also bore license plates that belonged to another Ford Falcon.
	
	
	The applicant failed to give way to a female pedestrian at a designated pedestrian crossing on Railway Street. The pedestrian took evasive action. Police activated their lights and warning systems and followed the applicant, who proceeded through a red traffic signal at an intersection in Dumaresq Street. The police initiated a pursuit. A pedestrian attempting to cross the road was forced to stop in the middle of the road. The applicant proceeded through another red traffic signal at the intersection of Dumaresq Street and the Moore-Oxley Bypass. At the intersection of the Moore-Oxley Bypass and Cordeaux Street, Campbelltown, the applicant proceeded through a third red traffic signal by making a right hand turn in circumstances where a truck and bus were obstructing the view from the left. Police terminated the pursuit due to the danger being posed to other road users.
	
	
	The pursuit recommenced a short time later on the Moore-Oxley Bypass where the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at an estimated speed of 160 kph in a signposted 60 kph speed zone. At 10.44am, the police finally terminated the pursuit due to the high volume of traffic and danger to other road users.
	
	
	The conduct described above was identified in the agreed Crown Facts as the conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence.
	
	
	At 10.45am, a second police vehicle (fully marked as a Highway Patrol vehicle) which was stationary at the intersection of Blaxland and Campbelltown Road, Campbelltown, observed the applicant’s vehicle travelling north through the intersection on Campbelltown Road at an estimated speed of between 80 kph per hour and 110 kph. The police activated all warning signs and attempted to stop the applicant’s vehicle. The applicant failed to stop and the police commenced pursuit. The applicant’s vehicle was travelling at an estimated speed of 100 kph in a 70 kph zone. The police terminated the pursuit due to the danger being posed to the public.
	
	
	A short time later, that police car observed the applicant’s vehicle travelling on the intersection of Eagle Vale Drive and Raby Road intersection, controlled by a roundabout. The applicant turned north onto Spitfire Drive, Raby and the police re-engaged pursuit. The applicant was observed travelling at an estimated speed of 120 kph in a 60 kph speed limit zone overtaking a single vehicle on the incorrect side of the road. A little later, the applicant’s vehicle was observed travelling south along Campbelltown Road, Minto before it crossed onto the incorrect side of the road at the commencement of the concrete median barrier that separated north and south bound lanes. The applicant ignored a ‘Keep Left’ sign at the commencement of the concrete median strip. At 10.49am, police terminated the pursuit and pulled over to the nearside breakdown lane.
	
	
	The applicant’s vehicle was observed to continue along Campbelltown Road, travelling south in the northbound lane (the incorrect side of the road), weaving in and out of oncoming traffic until colliding with an oncoming vehicle driven by a 72 year-old man. The impact occurred well within the victim’s lane. Both vehicles sustained extensive damage. Police who were situated approximately 400 metres away observed the victim’s vehicle become airborne, and estimated that the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at a speed of no less than 80 kph in a 70 kph speed limit zone.
	
	
	The conduct described above was identified in the agreed Crown Facts as the conduct the subject of the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	When police spoke with the applicant at Macquarie Fields’ police station he said: “It would never have happened if you’d left me alone and not chased me”. The applicant subsequently declined to be interviewed.
	
	
	The victim of the motor accident was taken to Liverpool Hospital suffering from a number of injuries including to his right shoulder and left anterior chest wall; displaced fracture of the right clavicle; blood in the right chest cavity; fractured sternum; lamina fractures of the third to fifth cervical vertebrae (broken neck bones); shallow right sided subdural haematoma over the right tentorium (intracranial bleeds); multiple rib fractures; fracture of the first lumbar vertical body (back bone fracture).
	
	
	The victim remained at Liverpool Hospital until he was discharged on 17 October 2013. Whilst in hospital the victim developed an acute embolic stroke that resulted in right sided hemiparesis (weakness with speech and swallowing deficiencies) which soon resolved although he suffered ongoing cognitive deficiencies.

	The proceedings on sentence commenced on 2 April 2015, were stood over, part-heard, to 13 May 2015 and due to the unavailability of documents on that date from Justice Health, stood over further to 9 June 2015. The applicant gave evidence in his case particularly directed to his medical condition, including ongoing eye problems. The Crown bundle (Exhibit A) included the agreed Crown Facts which, as indicated above, distinguished between the applicant’s two periods of conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence and the subject of the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	The Crown provided detailed written submissions on sentence. Attention was drawn to the principle of totality and the need for careful consideration whenever sentences are accumulated. The Crown submitted that the totality principle was not restricted to sentences imposed for offences committed as part of a connected and roughly contemporaneous series of offences. The Crown further submitted that the sentencing judge should look at each offence individually then take into account totality and accumulation. The Crown submission continued:
	


It is submitted that in order to reflect the objective seriousness of each of the offences and give appropriate punishment for each, your Honour should at least partially accumulate the sentences.

The judge’s reasons


	
	After summarising the agreed facts, his Honour made the following findings. Dealing with the offence of police pursuit, the judge found that the objective gravity of the offending fell towards the top end of the range. His Honour took into account that there was “the extreme potential for danger to other users of the roadway” and in this regard also referred to the applicant’s:
	


final desperate act of trying to evade the police by crossing onto the incorrect side of the concrete median barrier and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic would have been a terrifying experience for other motorists.


	
	Next, after referring to R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, the guideline judgment for dealing with the offence of aggravated dangerous driving, and subsequent authorities, the judge found that the applicant “clearly abandoned his responsibility to other users of the roadway” and that his “moral culpability is high”. It is convenient to set out the following passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence in full:
	


Of course the aggravated form of the offence arises from the fact that the offender was attempting to escape police at the time of the dangerous driving resulting in impact and grievous bodily harm. Whilst the Court is called upon to deal with the offender for the police pursuit charge the Court can have regard to aspects of his manner of driving leading to the collision and resulting injury. His driving was both erratic and aggressive and involved speeds well in excess of the applicable speed limit. He ignored the police warnings to stop. He ignored the keep left sign at the commencement of the median barrier. He took his car onto the incorrect side of the road into the path of oncoming vehicles, accordingly numerous other drivers were put at risk.


	
	The judge then summarised the applicant’s subjective case, including that the applicant was aged 45 years at the time of sentence, and his criminal history, including numerous convictions for driving whilst disqualified and related driving offences, and considered it such that he would not be entitled to any leniency. Having regard to the applicant’s ongoing eye problem, the judge found that the applicant’s time in custody would be much more difficult than it is for other prisoners. His Honour accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.
	
	
	The judge expressed his satisfaction, given the objective seriousness of the offences, that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate: Sentencing Act, s 5. The judge also expressed the view that at least a partial accumulation in respect of the two sentences should be imposed.
	
	
	The judge found special circumstances (under s 44 of the Sentencing Act) to support a variation of the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the overall term on two bases: one that there should be, at least, a partial accumulation in respect of the two sentences to be imposed; the other being that the applicant’s time in custody would be much more difficult due to his ongoing eye problem.
	
	
	After allowing for a 25 per cent discount for the early plea of guilty in the Local Court, his Honour imposed the sentences indicated.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred by imposing double punishment upon the applicant

Submissions

Applicant’s submissions


	
	In writing, the applicant referred to the common element principle identified in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 (Pearce) at [40] and submitted that the overlapping elements between the two offences under ss 51B and 52A(4) meant that the sentences imposed on the applicant involved double punishment as described in Pearce. It was submitted that both offences were committed whilst in control of a motor vehicle, the elements in common being (a) escaping police pursuit; and (b) driving in a manner dangerous to other persons. The unstated premise of this submission regarding double punishment was that a single act by the applicant was the basis of both offences.
	
	
	In oral argument, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the issue in the present case is of quite short compass. Counsel submitted that separation of the applicant’s driving into discrete aspects is an artificial construction of the circumstances, especially given that the total time involved was under 10 minutes. It was emphasised that the sentencing judge dealt with the facts of the offending on a global basis and did not make the distinction now drawn by the Crown in its submissions in this Court between the separate and distinct conduct giving rise to the two offences.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s failure to raise the double punishment issue before the sentencing judge, senior counsel for the applicant (who did not appear at the sentencing hearing) submitted that where a matter “may have been overlooked by the defence and the sentencing judge”, this Court may intervene to correct a miscarriage of justice or serious injustice, and relied on Zreika v R (2012) 223 A Crim R 460; [2012] NSWCCA 44 (Zreika) at [82] (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) and White v R [2016] NSWCCA 190 at [28] (Simpson J, Bathurst CJ agreeing).
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown’s submissions took a different approach. No submissions were directed to the question of whether there were common elements between the police pursuit offence and the aggravated dangerous driving offence. The Crown’s submissions focused on the question of whether the two offences were based on different conduct such that the common element principle in Pearce did not apply.
	
	
	In support of this submission the Crown identified four aspects of the applicant’s driving on 21 August 2013, which the Crown submitted should be divided into two different parts. The first part involved the pursuit by an unmarked police highway patrol vehicle which commenced at 10.42am in Railway Street, Campbelltown up to the point where the police finally terminated that pursuit on the Oxley-Moore Bypass at 10.44am. The Crown submitted that this aspect of the applicant’s driving satisfied the offence of police pursuit contrary to s 51B(1).
	
	
	The second part involved the pursuit by a marked police highway patrol vehicle which commenced at 10.45am on Campbelltown Road, travelled through the suburbs of Raby (and it seems St Andrews) before turning back in the direction of Campbelltown via Campbelltown Road at Minto when the police stopped the pursuit at 10.49am and shortly thereafter the applicant’s vehicle collided with an oncoming vehicle, injuring its driver. The Crown submitted that this aspect of the applicant’s driving related to the more serious offence of aggravated dangerous driving contrary to s 52A(4).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the criminality for the earlier driving conduct is distinct and separate to the criminality of the later conduct, because that earlier criminality was separate, there being a temporal disconnect between the two sets of offending.
	


Decision

(a)   The common element principle


	
	The common element principle identified in Pearce was reiterated in Johnson v R (2004) 205 ALR 346; [2004] HCA 15 (Johnson v R) at [33] – [34] where the plurality (Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ) emphasised that it is an error of principle to punish an offender twice for the commission of elements that are common to the offences of which he or she has been convicted.
	
	
	The premise of the common element principle is that the offender is being sentenced for two or more charges which arise out the same circumstances, or, as stated in Pearce (at [3]), the “two charges arose out of a single episode”.
	
	
	In Pearce, the offender broke into the victim’s home and beat him. Sentences had been imposed for numerous offences including counts 9 and 10, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act, and breaking and entering a dwelling house and inflicting grievous bodily harm in the dwelling contrary to s 110 of the Crimes Act. In each case the victim, and the grievous bodily harm inflicted on him, was the same. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a minimum term of 8 years on each of counts 9 and 10, to be served concurrently, but cumulatively upon a sentence for another offence. The High Court held that the sentence imposed on each offence fully punished the appellant for his infliction of grievous bodily harm on the victim. Accordingly, the offender was prima facie punished twice for that common element notwithstanding that the sentences for two offences had been ordered to be served concurrently: at [40] – [43] (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Gummow J agreeing at [69], contra Kirby J at [132]).
	
	
	The plurality (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Pearce stated the common element principle as follows (at [40]):
	


[40]   To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common.


	
	Their Honours continued (at [42] – [43]):
	


[42]   It is clear in this case that a single act (the appellant's inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim) was an element of each of the offences under ss 33 and 110. The identification of a single act as common to two offences may not always be as straightforward. It should, however, be emphasised that the enquiry is not to be attended by “excessive subtleties and refinements”. It should be approached as a matter of common sense, not as a matter of semantics.

[43]   The trial judge sentenced the appellant to identical terms of imprisonment on counts 9 and 10 and made those sentences wholly concurrent. We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act.


	
	The plurality then considered whether the prima facie conclusion that the appellant had been doubly punished was avoided by the sentencing judge making the sentences wholly concurrent before concluding it was not. The plurality held (at [45]) that a sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well as, of course, questions of totality. The plurality continued (at [49]):
	


[49]   Looked at overall, it may well be said that the effect of the sentences imposed on this appellant was not disproportionate to the criminality of his conduct. Nevertheless, we consider that the individual sentences imposed on counts 9 and 10 were flawed because they doubly punished the appellant for a single act, namely, the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Further, to make the sentences imposed on those two counts wholly concurrent may also be said to reveal error in that to do so failed to take account of the differences in the conduct which were the subject of punishment on each count. (emphasis added).


	
	The relevant principle to be derived from Pearce is that where an offender is convicted of offences arising from the same set of facts which have elements in common, the court should not sentence twice for the elements of the offences which are in common.
	
	
	In Pearce, it was the single act of inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the offender was doubly punished.
	
	
	In Johnson v R, the offender had pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (Customs Act) applied, namely a quantity of ecstasy, and a second count of attempting to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act also applied, namely a quantity of cocaine. The two offences arose from one transaction. In the High Court, the plurality held (at [33]) that the two offences “had much in common: one inducement, one payment for performance, one occasion, one package and one receipt of it by the appellant.” The plurality observed (at [30]) that the West Australian Court of Criminal Appeal had erroneously found that the offender took possession of two separate parcels of two separate drugs and that this error seems to have influenced the Court of Criminal Appeal in treating the offences as entirely separate, and in holding that there was no common element. The plurality stated (at [34]) that “[f]acts either lend themselves to the application of a particular principle or not.”
	
	
	In view of the conclusion I have reached below in relation to the proposed ground of appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the proper approach to sentencing when the offences arising from the same set of facts have elements in common: see the discussion in Portolesi v R [2012] NSWCCA 157 at [45] – [46] (Beech-Jones J, Basten JA and Harrison J agreeing).
	


(b)   The common element principle had no application on the facts in the present case


	
	It may be accepted for the purposes of argument (no submission to the contrary having been advanced by the Crown) that the elements of dangerous driving and police pursuit are common to both the offence under s 51B(1) and the aggravated form of the dangerous driving offence under s 52A(4). However, the existence of overlapping elements between the two offences does not in and of itself engage the double punishment principle described in Pearce. A closer examination of the facts is required.
	
	
	In considering the two offences’ underlying facts, the critical issue is whether the applicant’s driving on 21 August 2015 is, properly viewed, a single act or episode (as the applicant contended) or two separate and discrete acts giving rise to two separate offences (as the Crown contended).
	
	
	The starting point is the details of the conduct relied upon for each offence charged, which were different notwithstanding that they involved the driving of the same vehicle on the same day. The police pursuit offence was alleged to have been committed in a different suburb, namely “at Campbelltown and other places”. The aggravated dangerous driving offence was alleged to have been committed “at St Andrews and other places”. Location was thus an obvious differentiator between the respective charges.
	
	
	Next, the agreed statement of facts makes it abundantly clear that the two offences were separated in time and place, albeit that the temporal gap between the two offences was only very short. The conduct relied upon for the police pursuit offence was different from the conduct comprising the aggravated dangerous driving offence, the former offence being completed when the unmarked highway patrol vehicle terminated the pursuit on the Oxley-Moore Bypass at 10.45am, with the latter offence commencing with a pursuit by a second (marked) highway patrol vehicle at about 10.46am and concluding at about 10.49am when the applicant’s vehicle collided with an oncoming car on Campbelltown Road, Minto.
	
	
	In this case, the conduct relied upon as constituting the offences was separate and distinct. Although close in time and occurring in adjoining or nearby suburbs, this is not a case like Pearce where the two charges arose out of a single episode (the appellant having broken into the victim’s home and beaten him) or Johnson v R (where the two charges arose out of possession of one package of drugs). Both the terms of the charges and the agreed statement of facts support the Crown’s identification, in the applicant’s driving, of separate and discrete sets of conduct the subject of the two offences.
	
	
	That the sentencing judge treated the two offences as arising from separate and distinct conduct may be seen from his remarks on sentence. In his summary of the agreed facts, the judge noted the differences between the two highway patrol vehicles involved in the two pursuits. He also noted the different localities and the different times at which the two offences were committed. In accepting the Crown’s submission that there should be at least some accumulation of the sentences imposed, the judge may be taken to have had proper regard to the totality principle (Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, 304 (Dawson and Gaudron JJ); 307 – 309 (McHugh J); 335 – 339 (Kirby J)) including the objective seriousness of each offence. This does not mean that his Honour treated the two offences as a single episode or incident.
	
	
	Further, it is apparent from the judge’s remarks on sentence (set out at [28] above) when dealing with the aggravated dangerous driving offence, that his Honour was careful to distinguish between the applicant’s separate conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence, and the regard which could be had “to aspects of the [applicant’s] driving leading to the collision and resulting injury”. The aspects of the applicant’s driving involving police pursuit which his Honour identified may be taken to refer to the applicant’s conduct during the police pursuit by the second police highway patrol vehicle from 10.46 am to 10.49 am through the suburbs of Raby, St Andrews and Minto, leading to the collision at Campbelltown Road, Minto.
	
	
	It can be accepted that in an earlier part of the remarks on sentence when describing the “extreme potential for danger to other users of the roadway” the judge went on to refer, in the context of the charge of police pursuit, to the applicant’s “final desperate act of trying to evade the police by crossing onto the incorrect side of the concrete median barrier and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic would have been terrifying experience for other motorists”. This can be taken to be a reference to a subsequent aspect of the applicant’s driving involving the aggravated dangerous driving offence. As the applicant submitted, the judge at this point was dealing with the facts globally. Nonetheless, the distinction between the conduct involved in the police pursuit offence, and the subsequent conduct involved in the aggravated dangerous driving offence is implicit, arising from the judge’s preceding remarks as well as those made later when dealing with the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	His Honour’s remarks should not be read as an acceptance that the two offences were derived from a single episode or incident. There was no occasion for his Honour to consider the question of double punishment on the facts of the offending in this case.
	
	
	In my view, the error asserted in proposed ground 1 of the notice of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	Having regard to the above conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the applicant is precluded from raising the double punishment issue in this Court, not having raised the issue at the sentencing proceedings. On the view of the circumstances of the offending which I take, it is unsurprising that it was not raised before the sentencing judge; contrary to the applicant’s submissions in this Court, the sentencing judge was not dealing with two offences arising out of a single episode or incident but rather two separate and discrete sets of conduct.
	
	
	Nevertheless, if it were necessary to decide, I would accept the applicant’s submission that the principle of double punishment is so fundamental that the failure by the applicant and the Crown to raise it before the sentencing judge would necessarily lead to error for the reasons given in Pearce, and that Zreika would not preclude the applicant raising the matter on appeal.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	In my view, whilst leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	HIDDEN AJ: I agree with Gleeson JA.

		21 September 2016",2016-09-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
43,2756702,Police v Adel Benjamin ABRAHAM [2011] NSWLC 6,"JUDGMENT 

1The accused stands charged for that he: 

""On 23 December 2009, at Wagga Wagga in the State of New South Wales did assault [the complainant] and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on [the complainant], (namely) taking hold of her hand, rubbing her palm stating, 'do you know what this means? It means I want to have sex with you'"". 

2The charge was not brought until 8 September 2010, that being the date on which the Court Attendance Notice was created. According to the Service Copy of the CAN that is with the papers, it was personally served on the accused on that same date. 

3A plea of Not Guilty was entered on 14 October 2010 when the matter first came before the Court. Because of local administrative arrangements with the Local Court in the area (the regular Magistrate at Wagga Wagga was part heard in a matter at Albury), I heard this matter at the Wagga Wagga Local Court on 11 February 2011. The accused was and remains unrepresented. He lives in Melbourne. At the conclusion of the prosecution case the prosecutor fairly and appropriately indicated (without making any concessions) that there may be an issue as to whether the conduct of the accused, taken at its highest, could amount to an indecent assault. Given the importance of the matter, and the complexity involved I decided to reserve my decision. The accused lives in Melbourne, and Albury is closer than Melbourne. In those circumstances I deemed it appropriate to give my decision in Albury. 

4The accused was unrepresented at the hearing before me. Conformably with the legislation i.e. s. 294A Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the accused was not permitted to cross-examine the complainant. Ms. J. Mountford, a Registrar with the Court Registry at Wagga Wagga was appointed to assist the accused and cross-examine the complainant. Given the cross examination, it seems that the facts are in relatively short compass. As I understand from what was asked, and from what the accused said to me, he does not dispute the act as alleged in the averment in the Court Attendance Notice. On a number of occasions the accused indicated to me that the complainant ""misunderstood"" what he was doing and saying. 

5The prosecutor made an application for the complainant to give her evidence by way of closed circuit television. For reasons given ex tempore before the complainant gave evidence I acceded to that application. 

6The evidence for the prosecution consisted of oral evidence of the complainant and that of her mother. It seems that as is very often the case in matters of the sought that I am considering the evidence by the informant police officer is of a formal nature as to the charging process, and accordingly, does not advance the prosecution case. I have obtained a transcript of the evidence of the complainant. The evidence of the complainant's mother was relatively brief, and I have a comprehensive note of that evidence. 

7On the afternoon of 23 December 2009 the complainant attended the professional premises of the accused who at the relevant time was a dentist practicing in Wagga Wagga. She attended for an interview for possible employment as a dental assistant with the accused (see pp. 2-3). The accused answered the door and ushered the complainant to a waiting room. She was provided with a cordial type drink. After waiting some little while the accused returned to where the complainant was seated, and directed the complainant to his office. In showing the complainant to his office the accused placed his hand in the middle of the complainant's back (p. 3 l. 46). 

8The complainant went on to recount that the accused ""talked very vaguely about the position. Then he ...sort of leaned in, moved his chair really close and made a comment about me eyes. He said that I had beautiful eyes..."" (p. 4 ll. 40-42). The complainant moved away from the accused (p. 5 l. 14). The complainant had her hands in her lap, and the accused leant over and put his hands on her hands (p. 5 l. 22). The accused rubbed her hands and told her not to be scared of his affection as he is friendly towards his staff and he looks after them - see p. 5 ll. 35-7. The accused made a comment about the complainant being a ""good size"" and ""not too skinny"" - see p. 6 ll. 2-5. The accused told the complainant that she would not be able to wear high heels at the work place. 

9The accused proceeded to show the complainant the examination room. According to the complainant the accused had his hand in the small of her back for about 5 seconds. Her hands were by her side and the accused grabbed one of her hands and lifted it up (p. 7 l. 23). He commenced to rub the hand, ""moving his fingers and -like all over my hands"" (p. 8 line 1). The accused made a comment about having to order in smaller gloves for the complainant. At p. 8 line 15 the complainant said, ""I was scared. I really wanted to - you know, to pull my hand away and so - and leave but I was too scared"". 

10After the complainant had pulled her hand away the accused then asked the complainant to remove her shoes in order that he could see how tall she was. The complainant complied with the request - p. 8 l. 35. The accused then went to the complainant and had one of his arms pressed against her. 

11The complainant was told to put her shoes back on, and with that she was shown to another room where the accused reclined on a dentist's chair. He was about 2 metres from the complainant. It was obvious to the complainant that the accused had an erection at this point in time (p. 10 lines 10-14). According to the complainant the accused maintained to her that women found his irresistible (p. 11 l. 36). 

12There was further conversation including that he had attempted to secure the services of a female dentist to assist him (p. 12 l. 10 et seq). After that conversation the accused again took hold of one of the complainant's hands and commented to the effect that it was good that she did not wear much jewellery. He had hold of her hand for about 15-20 seconds. He was rubbing the hand that he was holding. At p. 12 line 50 and continuing the complainant said, ""I froze. I was scared, I didn't want him to touch me. And I'm sure he knew that because he kept, like, stating, 'don't be afraid of my affection', you know, 'I'm just a really friendly person"". 

13Shortly thereafter the accused gave the complainant a box of chocolates, at which time the accused wished the complainant Merry Christmas, and indicated that the chocolates had been for another staff member but she did not want them. He also began to discuss a starting date for the complainant. He was going through a diary at this time. The complainant said to the accused, ""I don't care, just pick a date. It's fine"". She maintained that she had no intention of taking the position, but that she ""just wanted to - just get out of here, but I didn't want to say, 'no, I don't want the job"". 

14The accused put his hand on the complainant's thigh (p. 14 lines 40-46) and again said words to the effect of ""don't be frightened by my affection"". 

15It was soon thereafter that the act relied upon by the prosecution to ground the charge against the accused occurred. The complainant gave evidence at p. 15 lines 15-21: 

""He - he asked me if - he picked up my hand off my lap - my hands were in my lap. He picked up by left hand and was holding it in his hand and he was stroking the middle of my palm with his - like his pointer finger or index finger, or whatever it's called. Then he asked me, you know, 'do you know what this means?' and I said, 'no'. I knew what it meant but I didn't want to go there with that conversation. And he said, 'it means that I want to have sex with you'"". 

The stroking of the hand went on for about 20 to 30 seconds (p. 15 l. 29). The complainant immediately pulled her hand away. 

16The complainant conceded that she was at the accused's premises for at least two hours (p. 18 l. 41). She later spoke to her mother about the incident. I will return later to the issue of complaint. 

17The cross-examination was conducted by a person appointed by the Court pursuant to the provisions of s 294A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The complainant was not shaken in respect of any of her evidence in the course of that cross-examination. She maintained that on the occasions that the accused had his hand on her back it was for 5 to 10 seconds (p. 22 l. 19). When asked why she did not leave she said, ""I was scared, and when I was scared I've just froze"" (pp 22-3). She denied that the accused indicated that from time to time he might touch her arm at work and further denied that she agreed that this would be ""OK"" (p. 23 - lines 45 & 48). It was put that the accused said that he was an affectionate person once or twice. The complainant maintained her evidence in chief that it was said a number of occasions (p. 25 l. 29). At p. 27 l. 13 the following was asked: 

""Q: I put to you that you have misconstrued this whole event?"" 

18The complainant answered: 

""A: That's incorrect"". 

Immediately thereafter the question ""did you invent this statement"" was asked. The complainant answered that she did not. 

19I note also that the accused said a number of times during the proceedings that the complainant misconstrued the events. 

20I return to the issue of complaint. The complainant maintained that she told her mother about the events, and that at the time of so doing she was upset and crying. There was not a great deal of detail given. That should not be taken as any criticism of the complainant or indeed her mother. The complainant's mother gave evidence that she spoke to her daughter at about 7.45pm on the 23 December 2009, i.e. the date of the alleged incident. The evidence was that her daughter told her that the accused spoke for about 5 minutes about the job, and then spent a lot of time talking about sex and behaved in an inappropriate fashion. The events relied upon by the prosecution to ground the charge of Indecent Assault did not form part of the evidence of the complainant's mother. 

21The High Court in its decision in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 approved the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131. As I understand the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v BD evidence of complaint can be admissible on a number of bases: (i) as to the truth of the contents of the representation - s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, subject of course, to the requirement of recency ( Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606 ) but noting the effect of s 66(2A) of the Evidence Act 1995; (ii) pursuant to s 60 (hearsay evidence for a non hearsay purpose) for e.g. going to consistency of conduct; or (iii) pursuant to s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 - i.e. to re-establish credit where it has been suggested either expressly or by implication that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion. Given the vague nature of the evidence of complaint both from the complainant and her mother I am prepared to admit the evidence of complaint going to consistency of conduct rather than for the hearsay purpose of the truth of the contents of what was said by the complainant. This however, has no bearing on the matter that now falls for me to determine. 

22The accused is unrepresented, and accordingly, as is invariably the case with unrepresented accused persons, the court cannot receive any meaningful assistance. The prosecutor, however, fairly and appropriately conceded that it may fall for the Court's consideration as to whether the prosecution case that the accused conducted himself in the fashion set out in the averment of the Court attendance notice could amount to an Indecent Assault. 

23For the purpose of deciding the issue of whether there is a prima facie case, I must take the prosecution evidence at its highest. No one should assume that I have at this stage made any findings of fact. In deciding this issue I must take the evidence of the complainant at its highest. 

24The High Court in May v O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 said at [7]: 

When at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is 'no case to answer' the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless there is some special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a case to answer has no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning to end. 

25The prosecution do not have to prove a separate assault and separate act of indecency in order to succeed on a charge of Indecent Assault. The Court of Appeal of NSW considered the provisions of s. 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 in the decision of Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 84 A Crim R 333. At 340 Sheller JA said: 

In 1925 in Sorlie 25 SR (NSW) 532 at 535, Street CJ with the concurrence of the other members of the court rejected the contention that what was contemplated was not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind, and an independent act of indecency. His Honour said: 

""...I think that any assault, which of itself amounts to the commission of an act of indecency upon the female assaulted or which of such a character as to involve an act of indecency upon her, comes with the terms of the section, and is a punishable offence"". 

So the law has stood since. 

26Kirby ACJ in that same decision said at p. 335: 

In Sorlie the court rejected the submission that there must be 'not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind and an independent act of indecency'. The authority of this holding has stood for more than 70 years. When s. 61L of the Crimes Act was drafted in like terminology, it must be assumed that the drafter and Parliament were aware of R v Sorlie and intended the same approach to be applied. It is now too late to resurrect the rejected arguments of 1924, to re-dissect the statutory requirements and to oblige the prosecution to prove both an assault and an independent act of indecency. 

I therefore agree with the other members of the court that, to the extent that Ireland J concluded that it was necessary for the appellant to prove an assault 'in the customary sense', that is, that he intentionally or recklessly put his victim in fear of immediate physical or other unlawful danger, he erred. 

27The conduct said to amount to an Indecent Assault in the matter I am considering is the accused taking hold of the hand of the complainant, rubbing her palm with his index finger and saying the words, ""Do you know what this means, it means I want to have sex with you"". It is difficult in the extreme to perceive of a situation where the taking of the hand and rubbing the palm could amount to an Indecent Assault. In the matter presently under consideration, it is the words spoken at the time that potentially make the alleged actions of the accused indecent. 

28Whether something is indecent is judged by prevailing community standards. After reviewing the judgments on the concept of indecency in Crowe v Graham (1968) 121 CLR 375, Debelle J in giving the leading judgment in Phillips v South Australia Police (1994) 75 A Crim R 480 said at 485: 

Thus all four justices used the same criterion, namely, contemporary standards of the Australian community but that test was used by Windeyer J. to determine both what is indecent and obscene. 

29Debelle J went on to say at 485-6: 

In A-G -v- Huber (1971) 2 SASR 142 at 167, 184 and 205-6 Bray CJ defined indecent behaviour as that which offends to a substantial degree against the recognised standards of common propriety...the requirement in Bray CJ's test that the material should offend to a substantial degree is intended, I think, to convey the view that the standards to be applied are those which ordinary decent minded but not unduly sensitive, people accept. 

30His Honour also said at 486: 

When considering contemporary standards currently accepted in the Australian Community, regard is had to the reasonable, ordinary, decent minded but not unduly sensitive person. As Windeyer J. notes in Crowe -v- Graham , contemporary standards are not the standards of those who peddle obscenities or indecencies nor that of the judge seeking to minimise what is indecent or obscene in order supposedly to show some judicial broadmindedness. 

31The decision of Phillips v South Australia Police also is authority for the proposition that the words ""indecent"", ""obscene"" and ""immoral"" all have different meanings - see the judgment of Debelle J at pp. 489-90. 

32The respective positions of the complainant and the accused are relevant. The complainant was a 17-year-old young lady who was attending the professional premises of the accused for a job interview. The accused is a middle-aged man, who in the particular circumstances was in a very superior position to the complainant. One can readily understand the complaint when she said on a number of occasions that she ""froze"". 

33In the decision of whether or not the matter is indecent I must be careful to ensure that I apply the contemporary standards of the reasonable, ordinary, decent minded but not unduly sensitive person rather than my own. Magistrates are very much part of the community, particularly in rural areas. Doing the best I can to apply those contemporary standards, noting what I have said above about taking the prosecution case at its highest, while the conduct of the accused in taking the hand of the complainant, rubbing it in the manner alleged, and using the words attributed in the circumstances of the difference in position, applying the test set out above, is indecent for the purposes of the decision that I am making at this stage of the proceedings. The issue of proof beyond reasonable doubt is an entirely different concept to be decided after all of the appropriate warnings and directions. The context of the conduct of the accused is also important. The accused touched the complainant a number of times, and at one stage had an obvious erection. 

34There is another issue: is there any evidence of intention by the accused to obtain sexual gratification. Lee J (Wood & Matthews JJ agreeing) in Harkin v R (1989) 38 A Crim R 296 said at 301: 

The purpose or motive of the appellant in behaving in that way is irrelevant. The very intentional doing of the indecent act is sufficient to put the matter before the jury. But if the assault alleged is one which objectively does not equivocally offer a sexual connotation, then in order to be an indecent assault it must be accompanied by some intention on the part of the assailant to obtain sexual gratification. 

35I do not have a transcript of the prosecutor's comprehensive submissions. However, my notes and recollection indicate that the thrust of the prosecutor's arguments were that intention to obtain sexual gratification can easily be inferred from the actions of the accused for the duration that the complainant was in his company, including having the erection at an earlier stage, and the words used. The issue of consent was also covered in the course of submissions. While the complainant may have acquiesced in the accused taking her hand, for the purposes of determining whether there is a prima facie case the complainant could not be taken to have been consenting to the rubbing of her palm, in particular, in the circumstances of the accused also uttering the words attributed. 

36The accused's submissions, with respect do not really assist on the issue of whether I find a prima facie case. He submitted that the complainant misconstrued what was said. Further, that he made a lot of comments, and that he did not touch her for long. 

37I must admit to vacillating on this issue. For the purpose of the decision I am making at this stage of the proceedings, once the finding is made that the conduct of the accused was indecent, then it seems on the decision of Harkin v R I am obliged to find a prima facie case. 

38However, for these reasons I find that there is a prima facie case.

Gilbert v. The King, 38 S.C.R. 284

Date: 1907-02-28

Josiah Gilbert Appellant;

and

His Majesty the
King Respondent.

1907: February 25, 26; 1907: February 28.

PRESENT:—Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington,
Maclennan and Duff JJ.

ON APPEAL PROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal law—Practice—Crown case
reserved—Reserved questions— Dissent from affirmance of
conviction—Appeal—Jurisdiction— Criminal
Code , 1892, ss. 742 , 743 , 744 , 750 —R.S.O. (1906), c. 146, ss. 1013,1015, 1016,1024—Admission of
evidence—Res gestae.

Evidence of statements made by a person, since deceased,
immediately after an assault upon him, under apprehension of further danger and
requesting assistance and protection, is admissible as part of the res gestce,
even though the person accused of the offence was absent at the time when such
statements were made. Reg. v. Beddingfield (14 Cox 341); Rex v. Foster (6 C.
& P. 325) and Aveson v. Kinnaird (6 East 188) followed.

Statements not coincident, in point of time, with the
occurrence of the assault, but uttered in the presence and hearing of the
accused and under such circumstances that he might reasonably have been
expected to have made some explanatory reply to remarks in reference to them, are
admissible as evidence.

On the trial of an indictment for murder the evidence was that
the deceased had been killed by a gun shot wound inflicted through the
discharge of a gun in the hands of the accused and the defence was that the gun
had been discharged accidentally.

Held, that, in view of the character of the defence and
the evidence in support of it, there could be no objection to a charge by the
trial judge to the jury that the offence could not be reduced by them from
murder to manslaughter but that their verdict should be either for acquittal or
one of guilty of murder.

Two questions were reserved by the trial judge for the opinion
of the court of appeal but he refused to reserve a third question, as to the
correctness of his charge on the ground that no objection to the charge had
been take at the trial. The court of appeal

[Page 285]

took all three questions into consideration and dismissed the
appeal, there being no dissent from the affirmance of the conviction on the
first and third questions, but one of the judges being of opinion that the
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered upon the second question
reserved. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,—

The majority of the court, being of opinion that the appeal
should be dismissed, declined to express any opinion as to whether or not an
appeal would lie upon questions as to which there had been no dissent in the
court appealed from, but it was held,—

Per Girouard J.—That
the Supreme Court of Canada was precluded from  expressing an opinion on points
of law as to which there had been no dissent in the court appealed from, McIntosh
v. The Queen (23 Can. S.C.R. 180) followed. Viau v. The Queen
(29 Can. S.C.R. 90) ; The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen (31
 Can. S.C.R. 81) and Rice v. The King (32 Can. S.C.R. 480)
referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of the North-West Territories, affirming the conviction of the appellant at the trial on an
indictment for murder, upon a reserved case stated by the judge who presided at
the trial.

The case reserved was stated by the trial judge,
Mr. Justice Newlands, as follows:—

""STATED CASE.""

""The above named Josiah Gilbert was charged
before me with the murder of one Barrett Henderson on or about the 15th day of
August, A.D. 1906, near Regina
in this judicial district. The accused pleaded not guilty and was tried before
me with a jury at Regina on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of November,
1906, and was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging at Regina on the 18th day of January, 1907.

""At the trial the annexed evidence was
admitted after being objected to by counsel for the accused.

[Page 286]

""After the verdict the counsel for the
accused applied to have the following questions reserved and I have, decided to
reserve the same under section 937  of the Criminal Code  for the opinion of the
court.

""1. Were: the statement; of the deceased
made while running towards Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them
admissible?

""2. Were the statements made by the
deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm
admissible?

""Said counsel for the accused also applied
to have the following question reserved:—

""3. Was the learned trial judge right in
stating to the jury in his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in
reducing the verdict from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted
only a verdict of murder or not guilty?

""In my charge to the jury I said, 'As far
as man-slaughter is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which
would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As
far as this case is concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before
you of provocation. As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has
been given in evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from
murder to manslaughter. The verdict as far as I can see can either be one of
not guilty, or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as
far as I can see, that are open before you.'

""No objection was taken to this charge at
the trial so I declined to reserve this question.""

""Regina, December 14th, 1906.""

""H. W. Newlands, J.S.C.""

[Page 287]

After hearing the
arguments of counsel, the court, in banc, affirmed the conviction, the opinion of the court being
unanimous as to the first and third questions. Mr. Justice Wetmore dissented
from the opinion of the majority of the court as to the
points of law involved in the second question.

His Lordship Chief
Justice Sifton and their Lord-ships Justices Newlands and Stuart concurred in
the following opinion
delivered by His Lordship Mr. Jus­tice Harvey.

Harvey J.—""The accused was charged with murder and tried by my brother Newlands with a jury and convicted,
and the matter now comes before this court by
way of a reserved case as to the admissibility of certain evidence which was given on the trial.

""Two men were
passing near the scene of the alleged murder about the
time it was supposed to have been committed
and their attention was drawn to the accused
whom they saw running with something in his hand, which they took to be
a gun and which the subsequent evidence shews was a gun. At almost the same moment they heard a shout and saw the deceased
apparently fleeing from the accused and waving
his hands and calling to them to stop. The gun was dropped, but the pursuit continued until the deceased reached
the witnesses, and on his way to them and when reaching them, he shouted more
than once, 'Hold on, hold on; he shot me and he will shoot me again. Hold on, boys, hold on.' The first question
which is reserved is whether the
evidence of these statements was
properly admitted, and I am of the opinion that this question should be
answered in the 20 1/2

[Page 288]

affirmative. Apart
altogether from whether the words were uttered in the
presence of the accused, it appears to my
mind clear that the circumstances, including
the utterance of the words used, were so closely connected with the
shooting as to be properly admissible for, although the witnesses in question
did not hear the sound of a shot, another witness did hear such sound and
almost immediately after saw the two men
running as they were when they first attracted the attention of the two witnesses
first mentioned.

""The strongest
case which could be referred to against the admissibility of this evidence was Reg. v. Bedingfield ([1]), in which Chief
Justice Cockburn refused
to receive the evidence of a statement made by the
deceased to a person whom she met after coming out of the house where the
accused was and where the murder was alleged
to have been committed. It is easy to see a difference in principle
between the two cases. In the present case
there was a continuity of circumstances of which the shooting was part and in
which the accused was a participant, which did not exist in the Bedingfield Case ([2]).
So that for the purpose of this case it is not necessary to dissent from Chief
Justice Cockburn's view though some of the text writers, Taylor, par. 583; Phipson, p. 49, express
the view that he interpreted the rule too
strictly.

""In Rex v. Foster ([3]) the court, consisting of three judges,
held as admissible a statement made by the deceased in answer to a question by
a witness who did not see the act which was
the cause of the death but came up
after. This case appears to have been accepted as authoritative, and the principle is given by Taylor, par. 583, as follows: ""The
principal points








[Page 289]

for consideration are, whether the circumstances
and declarations offered in proof were so connected with the main fact under consideration as to illustrate
its character, to further its object
or to form in conjunction with it one
continuous transaction.""

""It appears to
me beyond question that the present case falls within this principle and the authority of Rex v. Foster ([4]).

""The second question reserved is as to the
admissibility of evidence of an expression of
the deceased at a later time and in
no way connected with the res gestce. An exchange of
conveyances was being made by the deceased
and the accused, and the witness states
that while the deceased was being helped by him across, he turned around and saw the accused who was about
five or six feet behind, whereupon 'he made a
big jump into the buggy and said, 'Don't let him knife me.""

""This utterance appears to me to be nothing
more than an unequivocal exclamation indicating fear of injury from the accused on the part of the deceased. The principle
on which an exception to the rule that hearsay
evidence is inadmissible is made in the case of statements made in the
hearing of an accused, or in a civil case in
the hearing of an opposite party, is that
he has an opportunity of denying it, and if he fails to do so, it is
some evidence as against him of the truth of
the statement. When one considers that the utterance in question is not a
statement of fact at all and is not
susceptible of denial by the accused, it is at once evident that the principle has no application and at the same
time the principle of exclusion as hearsay has no application. The question
appears to








[Page 290]

me to be one then simply of
whether the state of mind of the accused in
this respect is material, and if it is, there is no rule as far as I am aware that requires the exclusion of this remark. It seems to me that
the evidence of the witness when he said that when de-ceased saw accused near him 'he made a big jump
into the buggy' stands in exactly the same position as the evidence of
what deceased said, for each indicates the
same thing, viz., fear of accused, and nothing more except that the
spoken words are less equivocal than the act.

""The charge is one of
deliberately shooting the deceased while the
defence is that the shooting was purely accidental. If it were shewn that after
the shooting the state of mind of the
man shot were one of friendliness to
the accused, it surely would be deemed
to have an important bearing on the question in issue, and in the same way evidence indicating aversion and fear have
as important a bearing in the opposite
direction. Wigmore, in his work on Evidence,
points out very fully the difference between the admission of utterances as proof of the truth of the facts stated and
their admission to prove a state of mind
which he terms their circumstantial use as opposed to the other or testimonial use, and states, in par. 1790, that to the use circumstantially the
hearsay rule makes no opposition 'because the utterance is not used for the sake of inducing belief in any
assertion it may contain.'

""For
the reason stated I am of opinion that this evidence was properly admitted.

""A third question,
though not reserved, was argued by counsel,
viz., that the learned judge erred in charging the jury that there was
no evidence to justify them in finding a verdict
of manslaughter.

[Page 291]

""No
one gave evidence of the actual shooting except the accused himself, and his
evidence and evidence of admissions made by him before the trial was the only evidence of the
actual occurrence. These all concurred in maintaining that the shooting was
purely accidental.
If the jury had believed this evidence, the only verdict they could have found would have been one of acquittal; but if they did not believe it,
the only conclusion from the
evidence was that the shooting having been established the intention to
effect the natural consequence of the act
existed and that the act was one of
murder. It is quite easy to see that a hypothesis
could be advanced that the actual facts made the case one of
manslaughter, but that the accused, being
the only eye witness of the shooting, determined
to concoct a story which would enable him
to escape the consequence of even that act; but this would be simply a
hypothesis, and the jury were bound to bring
in a verdict on the evidence and not on
hypothesis. I am of opinion that the judge's charge was right in this respect.

""In
the result therefore the learned trial judge's rulings on the two questions reserved and on the other
question which was argued should be confirmed and the conviction should be affirmed.""

The
opinion of Mr. Justice Wetmore was delivered, as follows:—

Wetmore J.—""I agree with my brother Harvey that the evidence of the statements made by the
deceased Henderson to the witnesses Koch and
Dick while coming towards them and after he arrived there was properly admitted as being part of the res
gestce. I also agree that there was no misdirection in the case. 

[Page 292]

But I am
of opinion that the statement made by the deceased and testified to by McKinnon,
namely, 'Don't
let him knife me,' was improperly received in evidence. This statement was offered
in evidence as
a statement made in the presence and hearing of the accused and only upon that ground.
It was not pretended that it was
admissible on any other ground. Evidence of this character is admissible
because the jury or judge of fact is able to
draw an inference from the conduct,
the language, or the silence of the other
party in whose presence and hearing the statement is made. Evidently, if the statement was not heard by such party, no inference could be drawn from his conduct, language or silence. In this
case I may say that any reference that
might be drawn was to be drawn from
the silence of the accused. In order
to render such testimony admissible I think that the judge ought to be thoroughly satisfied that the party accused
heard the statement. I will concede
that, ordinarily, if it is established that the statement was made in the presence of the accused and that he was at such a distance at the time that
the statement would likely be heard
by him, this would be sufficient to
admit the evidence of the statement. But if the circumstances are of such a
character that render it possible that the statement might not have been heard by him or render it doubtful whether it
was heard by him, evidence of the
statement ought not to be received.
In this case the witnesses Koch and
Dick were not very far distant from where the deceased and the accused were at the time the statement was made, and I think they would have been likely to hear it. Now, if they did not hear it, I think it is open to doubt whether the accused heard
it. I am not prepared, however, to
state that I would

[Page 293]

hold that the evidence of this statement was
improperly received if there was nothing further in the case than what I have stated. But it was developed at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings that the accused was hard of hearing, and he distinctly swore that
he did not hear the statement made by the deceased and testified to by
McKinnon. This state of facts having come
out, in my opinion rendered the testimony of McKinnon as to the statement inadmissible, or in other words
improperly received. It is urged that inasmuch as the testimony when received
was admissible, it is not rendered inadmissible by testimony subsequently
given. I dissent from that proposition. If
testimony of this character is
received under a mistaken apprehension of facts it must be considered none the
less inadmissible if future
developments of facts shew that it ought not to have been admitted. In a case of that sort I am of opinion that either the jury should be
discharged from giving a verdict or
the objectionable testimony expressly withdrawn from their consideration by the
trial judge. I am inclined to think
that the latter course would have
been quite sufficient for the purpose.
It was further urged that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the admission of this testimony. I cannot accede to this
proposition either. It is very
difficult to state what will or will not
influence the mind of a juryman. The remark 'Don't let him knife me' had
no direct reference to the shooting; it must
be remembered that when the remark was made the accused had no gun with
him and a remark such as 'Don't let him shoot me' would not be pertinent as he had no means of shooting. The
words, Don't let him knife me' might
be pertinent however, and it was a
remark from which a juryman might

[Page 294]

infer
'Don't let this man who shot me, as I told you, knife me.' Nor can I bring my mind to the conclusion that this was a mere exclamation of fear alone.
Doubtless it was an exclamation of fear, but it was an exclamation which
not only expressed fear but expressed fear of
the accused. I am of opinion, for the
reasons above stated, that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.""

Chrysler K.C. and James Balfour for the appellant. The statutory provisions affecting the case are to
be found in the ""Criminal Code ,
1892,"" sections 742 , 743 , 744 
and 750 , and in the new Code as consolidated in the Revised Statutes of 1906, sections 1013, 1015. 1016 and
1024.

The court of appeal, the
Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, was not unanimous in affirming the conviction,
Mr. Justice Wetmore being in favour of allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial; therefore, we
comply with the condition of section 742 of the old Code. We come to this court upon a judgment as entered
there and we appeal against the affirmance of the conviction by a judgment which was not
unanimous; it is of no consequence what might have been the individual reasons
of any of the judges for their opinions which led to that judgment.

We
refer to the Queen v. Cunningham ([5]), which is referred to in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([6]),
by Taschereau
J., at page 185. The question has been since discussed in the case of Viau v.
The Queen ([7]), in the








[Page 295]

judgment of the
court by Taschereau J. In the present case the third
question, although not reserved, was argued
and decided in the court below which treated the point of procedure as
having been waived. See also Rice v. The King ([8]), per Strong C. J.

We rely upon Reg.
v. Bedingfield ([9]),
on which Lord Cockburn subsequently wrote a pamphlet
which will be found in the Law Journal for
1880, at page 5. See also Best on
Evidence ([10]).
Archbold in his work on Criminal Evidence, concludes that Reg. v.
Bedingfield ([11]), was
affirmed by the decision in Goddard's Case ([12]).

the respondent.

Chief Justice:—The
appellant in this case was tried at Regina, Province of Alberta, in the month of November, 1906,
and found guilty of the murder of one
Barrett Henderson; thereupon he was sentenced
to death.

The learned judge
before whom the case was tried, at the request of
counsel for the prisoner to reserve some
questions as to the admissibility of evidence,








 

[Page 296]

stated a special
case for the opinion of the court of appeal. The questions reserved for the opinion of the court were:

Were the statements of the deceased made while running towards
Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them admissible?

Were the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on
arriving at the house on deceased's farm admissible?

The counsel for the
accused also applied to have the following question reserved:

Was the learned trial judge right in stating to the jury in
his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in reducing the verdict
from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted only a verdict of
murder or not guilty?

The judge in the case,
as reserved, says:

In my charge to the jury I said: ""As far as manslaughter
is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which would other-wise be
murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so
in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As far as this case is
concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before you of provocation.
As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has been given in
evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from murder to
manslaughter. The verdict, as far as I can see, can either be one of not guilty
or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as far as I can
see, that are open before you.

No objection was taken to this charge at the trial so I
declined to reserve this question.

The court of appeal, Wetmore J. dissenting, held
that the statements made by the deceased to
McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm were admissible. The court was unanimously of opinion that the statements made by deceased while running towards
Dick and Koch and after joining them were properly
admitted and also that there had been no misdirection.

A question was raised here as to whether an
appeal

[Page 297]

lies to this court on the question reserved as
to which there was no dissent in the court of appeal, but as we all agree that the appeal should be dismissed we
do not think it necessary to express
any opinion on that point of practice
nor as to whether or not the question
of misdirection was ever properly before the court below. Section 1016 , Criminal Code ; McIntosh v. The Queen ([19]).

The first
statement of the deceased was made immediately after the assault. The only evidence as to the actual shooting was given by the accused, but a witness, Vine
Brooks, heard the sound of a shot and immediately afterwards saw two men whom
she describes as running away from the barn one apparently pursuing the other. Koch and Dick to whom the statement
admitted in evidence was made were passing on
the highway not far from the barn in which the fatal shot was fired.
When first seen by the witnesses the
accused was running through the field with something in his hand, which subsequent evidence shews was a gun,
and, almost immediately, their attention was drawn to the deceased who was
running from the accused towards them shouting, as they afterwards ascertained, for protection. The pursuit continued,
although the gun was dropped by the accused, until the deceased reached the
witnesses when he shouted to them several times as he approached—

Hold on, hold on, he shot me and he will do it again; hold on
boys, hold on.

When Koch and Dick were
examined their evidence as to what occurred under these circumstances when the
deceased approached them and immediately there-








[Page 298]

after when with
them in the vehicle was objected to. The trial judge held it to be admissible
and his ruling was
sustained by the unanimous judgment of the court of appeal, and, as was intimated at the close
of the argument here, we
entertain no doubt that the evidence
was properly admitted.

At the trial, in the
court of appeal and at the argument here, counsel for the accused relied in
support of their
objection on the case of Reg. v. Bedingfield ([20]), wherein the
admissibility of this kind of evidence was discussed and Cockburn, C.J. excluded all testimony
of declarations after the
act was done. This ruling was
much criticized at the time and led to a vigorous discussion of the whole subject by Judge Pitt
Taylor, in England, and
Professor Thayer, in the United States, in the course of which the chief justice issued a pamphlet in defence of his ruling
wherein he defines the
term res gestce:

Whatever act, or series of acts, constitute, or in point of
time immediately accompany and terminate in, the principal act charged as an
offence against the accused, from its inception to its consummation or final
completion, or its prevention or abandonment,— whether on the part of the agent
or wrong-doer in order to its performance, or on that of the patient or party
wronged, in order to its prevention,—and whatever may be said by either of
the parties, during the continuance of the transaction, with reference to it,
including herein what may be said by the suffering party, though in the absence
of the accused, during the continuance of the action of the latter, actual or
constructive,-as e.g., in the case of flight or applications for assistance—
form part of the principal transaction, and may be given in evidence as part of
the res gestce, or particulars of it.

There can be no doubt that under this definition
the statement of the deceased to Koch and Dick would be admissible as








 [Page 299]

having been used under the apprehension of
further danger and when asking for assistance and protection even if the accused
was absent.

It will be observed further that in the Bedingfield
Case ([21])
when the woman Eliza Rudd came out
of the house with her throat cut all
action on Bedingfield's part had ceased and she was not fleeing as in the present case from her assailant.

In Rex v. Foster
([22]),
the court, consisting of three judges, held as admissible a statement made by deceased in answer to a question by a
witness who did not see
the act which was the cause of the death but came up after.

The case of Aveson v. Lord Kinnaird ([23]) bears strongly upon the point, Park J. and Patterson J. concurring. In that
case Lord Ellenborough said

if at the time she fled from the immediate personal violence
of the husband I should admit what was said.

The admissibility of the second statement to McKinnon is not so clear. It was made under these circumstances: After the deceased running up to Koch
and Dick in the road where they were joined by
Gilbert had given his first explanation of the shooting and asked for
their protection; the parties then present
separated, Koch and Gilbert going to the latter's barn to get his team while Dick and the deceased
went over to the shack in which Henderson lived with his hired man McKinnon who, on their arrival, very naturally asked for an explanation of the
occurrence which has not been given
in evidence. Subsequently, however,
Gilbert appeared on the scene with Koch; then ensues a conversation with McKinnon during the








[Page 300]

course of which
Gilbert attempted to explain that the shooting was due to an accident. The deceased who was being placed in a buggy, to be
conveyed to the hospital at
Regina for medical treatment, perceiving the accused who stood about six feet away
from him made a jump
exclaiming, ""Don't let him knife me.""

It has been argued
that this statement of the deceased is not admissible
as part of the res gestce not being
coincident in point of time with the main facts to be proved. However that may be we are all of opinion that the words spoken on this occasion are
admissible on the ground that they
were uttered in the presence and
hearing of the accused, and under such
circumstances, in the light of what he had previously stated to
McKinnon, that he might have been reasonably
expected to make some answer or remark in
reply thereto or explaining that his proximity to deceased did not involve any such danger as he seemed to feel.

The presumption,
even taking the previous statement of counsel as to the
condition of accused's hearing as a fact,
would be that he might reasonably be presumed
to have heard. And the learned and careful
trial judge has in the exercise of a discretion vested in him decided the preliminary fact and allowed the
evidence on the ground that the necessary conditions
had been fulfilled.

The later statement
of accused when giving evidence
denying having heard the statement, could not have any effect on the previous ruling or become a test of its correctness.

The charge in view
of the character of the defence and evidence in support of it cannot be complained of in so far as we can express an
opinion in the ab-

[Page 301]

sence of the text of
the charge which is not before us.

There was no case
of culpable homicide of less degree than murder presented on the evidence. And the accident testified to by the accused would
have, if credited,
entitled him to acquittal.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Girouard J.—Following
the decisions of this court in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([24]); Viau
v. The Queen ([25]) ; The Union Colliery Co. v. The Queen ([26]); Rice v. The
King ([27]), I
feel that I have no jurisdiction to express any opinion upon the points of law involved in questions one and three. It was decided in those cases
that no appeal lies to this court on
questions as to which there was no
dissent in the court of appeal. For
that reason I agree that the appeal must be dismissed as to those two points.

As to the second question, I concur in the
reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. I
wish to add merely a word. The trial
judge was undoubtedly the sole judge
as to the admissibility of the statement or exclamation to McKinnon. He could not suppose that the prisoner, when standing within four or
five feet, did not hear it. When,
subsequently, the prisoner, being
examined, disclosed the fact that he did not hear the deceased, the counsel for the prisoner does not appear to have requested the trial judge
to leave the veracity of this statement to the jury. Perhaps he did, and it may be that the judge left the
question to the jury. We have no means
of knowing. At all events, the point is not reserved, and is not even








[Page 302]

mentioned by the learned judge. I, therefore,
believe that, as to this second question also, the appeal should be dismissed.

Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

1BATHURST CJ: Ms Lillian Ratcliff (the appellant) was charged with two counts of supply of a prohibited drug under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act). Along with Ms Kerry Ann Buckman, whose appeal was heard simultaneously with this appeal, the appellant argued that s 25(1) of the Drug Act was invalid as being inconsistent with Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

2Freeman DCJ dismissed the appellant's motion to quash the indictment on this ground but granted the appellant a certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal to this Court.

3The appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal of Ms Buckman and each of the appellant and Ms Buckman adopted the other's submissions. I have set out the legislative framework and summarised the submissions in my judgment in respect of the appeal of Ms Buckman. It is unnecessary to repeat what I have said there.

4For the reasons I have given in my judgment in respect of Ms Buckman's appeal, I am of the view there is no inconsistency between s 25(1) of the Drug Act and Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). It follows that the appeal should be dismissed.

Choo Han Teck J:
The claims
1          This is an action by the plaintiff to recover various moneys and property, which she claimed to have been given by her to the defendant on trust. The plaintiff is a 74-year-old retiree and was at the material times a parishioner in the Church of St Theresa, where the defendant was, during those times, the parish priest. The plaintiff’s claims may be referred to in the following terms for convenience. There are four items of claim, namely:
(a)        394,000 shares in a Malaysian public company called Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd (“the Guinness shares”).
(b)        RM350,000 in cash given to the defendant in October 1994.
(c)        $30,000 given to the defendant in May 2002. This money was given in three $10,000 notes and kept in a safe deposit box in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (“HSBC”) opened in the name of the defendant in May 2002 (“the safe deposit box”).
(d)        $12,000 paid by the plaintiff to HSBC for unit trusts purchased in the name of the defendant when she opened the safe deposit box.
The plaintiff had also made various ancillary or alternative claims in respect of the Guinness shares, including asking for an order that the defendant provide an account of the sale of any of the shares, and any dividends received, and for an order for damages for wrongful conversion.
2          The plaintiff, a Catholic since the 1960s, attended mass at the Church of St Theresa from 1991 because her father’s ashes were interred in that church. She testified that she founded her trust in the defendant over the years mainly on the office the defendant held as a priest, but she did not know, until she read his amended Defence, that he had regarded himself as her “spiritual director”, and “regular priest-confessor”. The defendant was the parish priest at the Church of St Theresa from 1989 to 2002. He was transferred to the Holy Trinity Church in 2002. However, the plaintiff continued to attend mass at the Church of St Theresa with her usual regularity.
3          The plaintiff testified that she was shocked to learn, on 1 April 2003, that the defendant was under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) for criminal offences involving money donated to the church for its building fund. The plaintiff and her family had also donated to this fund. Eventually, the defendant was charged and convicted in the District Court for various offences involving the breach of trust of church money and was sentenced to imprisonment. The plaintiff’s claims in this action were not the subject of the criminal proceedings although she testified in the defendant’s criminal trial and was cross-examined in relation to these items claimed. I digress here to make a quick point which will become clearer as the facts and issues of this care unfold in this judgment, namely, that if the plaintiff’s evidence is accepted, then the defence of laches must fail. In other words, the plaintiff would not have sat on her rights and done nothing for an inordinately long time.
The Guinness shares
4          The plaintiff testified that she had the Guinness shares since the 1960s, and her stock had been enlarged by purchases made by her father for her, as well as through bonus and rights issues. In 1994, when she had decided to open a trading account in Kuala Lumpur, she had asked the defendant “whether he could hold some shares for [her] in his name”, and he had agreed. She explained that she did not know her broker in Kuala Lumpur well, and therefore, had preferred not to let him know that she had so many shares in Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd. She admitted that she could not remember the exact words she had used when she handed the shares to the defendant, but she was “absolutely certain” that she had asked for his help, and he had agreed to help. The plaintiff testified that she only found out that the defendant had appropriated her Guinness shares to his own use when the CAD told her this in April 2003. The plaintiff did not then wish to “complicate matters” for the defendant and had instructed her solicitors to withhold her claims until after the defendant’s criminal proceedings had ended.
5          The defendant’s version was that the shares were given to him as a personal gift because he had agreed to act as the executor and trustee of the plaintiff’s will in 1994. These shares were worth about a million dollars by counsel’s reckoning. It is not known what the full worth of the plaintiff’s assets were at the time, but she had named the Catholic Church as the beneficiary of her house at Holland Road. In any event, the Guinness shares would form a large part of her assets. She had handed the two share certificates covering the 394,000 Guinness shares to him in the compound of the Church of St Theresa on the evening of 12 July 1994, after mass. He testified that she had told him that she had a gift for him, and had handed him a white envelope. She had told him that it contained some of her bonus shares in Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd which were worth about $1m. He stated that he “could hardly believe [his] ears as never in [his] life before had he received such a large gift”. The plaintiff disputed this version. The defendant further elaborated that the plaintiff had written “92,000 bonus” on the envelope. He explained that it was not unusual in those days for companies to give one-for-one shares and that he had got such bonus shares from other companies such as Sime Darby, Shell, and Genting Berhad. The plaintiff’s claim presently is for the return of 364,000 of the Guinness shares because the defendant had sold 30,000 of the shares (for which the plaintiff claims for an account to be taken). According to the plaintiff, she did not know about the sale until sometime in 1995, after she had recovered from surgery on her eye. She was peeved that the defendant had sold her shares without consulting her. However, she was somewhat mollified when he said that he had used the sale proceeds in aid of charity. She thought that it might appear rude then to ask that he return all the other shares. She felt that her displeasure had shown through sufficiently and that the defendant would be unlikely to sell any more of her shares without her permission. Indeed, he did not do so.
The RM350,000
6          The plaintiff testified that sometime in 1994, she had wanted to transfer some of her Malaysian money to the defendant’s account in Malaysia so that he could use the money for her benefit in time of need. She had written him a cheque drawn on her Citibank account in Kuala Lumpur. She later learnt that the defendant had deposited this cheque into an account in Malayan Banking Bhd that he held jointly with one Chia Li Ling. It will be seen why the facts in the defendant’s criminal case are relevant in this regard. There, the defendant had pleaded guilty to a charge of misappropriation by transferring money from the parish church’s account into the joint account he held with Chia Li Ling. The defendant’s case in this action before me was that the plaintiff had given him the money as a generous gift. The submission made on his behalf by his counsel, Mr Low, was entirely to show that there were no good reasons for the plaintiff to create a trust of this money. Furthermore, Mr Low questioned rhetorically why the plaintiff did nothing for years after knowing that the defendant had sold 30,000 of her shares. One answer could be that it was because she had already given the shares to the defendant and he could do with them as he pleased. Another reason could be that she believed the defendant when he told her that he had sold the 30,000 shares to raise funds for charity. The questions raised by counsel were, independently, reasonably sound; but if the plaintiff’s account were true, that would be a sufficient answer to Mr Low’s question.
The $30,000 in $10,000 notes
7          The plaintiff had rented the safe deposit box on 14 May 2002 at HSBC in the name of the defendant and had deposited three $10,000 notes into the box. She said that this arose from a chain of events. She had drawn up a will in which the defendant had been named as the sole executor and trustee. When he told her that his papers in his church office were accessible to third parties, the plaintiff had become concerned that her will might not be kept in the privacy that she wanted. Hence she had opened the safe deposit box for the defendant to keep her will. She had also given him the three notes of $10,000 each to be used for her in case of urgent need. At that time, she also appointed the defendant as the alternate account holder of her own safe deposit box. She explained in court that although he was the alternate account holder, there was only one key and she kept it. Thus, she wanted to leave some ready cash in her executor’s safe deposit box for his convenience. The defendant claimed that the $30,000 deposited into the safe deposit box was a present by the plaintiff to him. His case was that the plaintiff had already made him the joint account holder to her own safe deposit box, and hence, he had access to anything kept there so that there was no need to make provision for an emergency, so to speak. The plaintiff’s answer to this was that although the defendant was a joint account holder, she held the only key to that safe deposit box. The defendant did not challenge this evidence, but that might only mean that his access to the box would be more difficult – not that it would be impossible.
The $12,000 deposit
8          The plaintiff testified that HSBC was only willing to let her open the safe deposit box (which was opened in the defendant’s name) if she placed a $12,000 deposit with the bank as an investment. The defendant disputed that, and claimed that the safe deposit box was opened by the plaintiff and maintained by her solely for his personal benefit, to do as he pleased, because she was sorry for him that he did not have one. He claimed that the $12,000 deposit was intended by the plaintiff to be a gift to him.
Evaluation of the evidence
9          The competing versions of the plaintiff and defendant, on each of the claims, are reasonably credible. For example, in the one, it is possible that the plaintiff had given the shares and money to the defendant, at the time when their relationship was at its strongest, intending them to be given as personal gifts to the defendant. The plaintiff was a wealthy person who had donated millions of dollars to the church and other charities. She testified that she had given $10,000 to one Sister Lau, whom she did not know then, when Sister Lau made a personal appeal to her for financial aid towards her studies abroad. The plaintiff testified that when Sister Lau was in charge of the De LaSalle School, she had made an appeal for funds for the school and the plaintiff had responded by donating $50,000. Subsequently, when Sister Lau became the principal of Catholic Junior College and appealed to her financially, the plaintiff had given a $10,000 contribution in the form of a $10,000 note that was handed to the defendant to be given to Sister Lau. The defendant had kept the note and written a cheque for $10,000 from the 
Church
’s account. The defendant, on the other hand, claimed in this trial that the plaintiff had given him money in the form of $10,000 notes previously, and cited this occasion as an example. The defendant admitted that Sister Lau had written a receipt made out to the
 
Church and handed it to him, but he had not handed it over to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Michael Khoo SC, suggested to the defendant that the receipt would have put the plaintiff on inquiry as to why Sister Lau had made out the receipt to the parish church, and not to her. The defendant’s version (that he had given the $10,000 note to Sister Lau) was, therefore, not supported by this fact.
10        It may not be unreasonable for a person of such a generous disposition as the plaintiff to lavish her generosity in the way the defendant alleged, that is, on her priest who was also her confidant and friend (if that were the case). On the other hand, it is also possible that she had intended to keep some cash and stock in the care of her trusted priest, and friend, to her use in a time of need. The plaintiff is now 74 years old. At the time she handed the Guinness shares to the defendant in 1994, she was 63. Although she had siblings who were also wealthy, she was the main person looking after her mother and keeping her company. In 1994, her own health was threatened by a mysterious growth in her left eye that required surgery, and consequently, she made arrangements in respect of her financial assets in case she were to become incapacitated after her surgery. Her reasons for handing over the shares to the defendant, helping him open and maintain a safe deposit box, and depositing large sums of money with him for safe keeping would seem reasonable enough in the circumstances. The defendant’s version in respect of the opening of the safe deposit box and the advance of the $12,000 necessary to open it, if true, would show, in a sense, the generosity of the plaintiff to the defendant to the extreme. But, if she was happy to give him the Guinness shares, then $12,000 pales immediately in comparison. The issues are thus not as straightforward or unconnected as one might think.
11        This court has to decide which of the two possibilities, each reasonable in itself, is the more probable. The core of the two competing versions of the story, that is, whether the money and shares were handed over as gifts or given upon trust, emanated from only two witnesses – the plaintiff and the defendant. There was no independent corroboration of either story. There were no other witnesses to bear testimony to either account. Apart from the testimony of the two protagonists, I am left with only the peripheral and background facts from which counsel urged me to draw various inferences – inferences that would incline me to one result or the other. Some of these facts are undisputed and incontrovertible – such as the fact that the defendant had pleaded guilty to various criminal charges involving the misappropriation of money belonging to the 
Church 
of
 
St Theresa
. But even so, some aspects of these facts remain open to question, for example, the reasons as to why the defendant decided to plead guilty midway through the criminal trial. The defendant averred that he had personal reasons, not least prompted by eminent members in the high echelons of the Catholic Church, to do so. Mr Khoo, however, suggested that no such thing occurred, and the conclusion he urged me to form, from his cross-examination of the defendant, was that (to put it bluntly) the defendant had pleaded guilty because he was in fact guilty. But what does that guilt mean in this case before me?
12        Section 54 of the Evidence Act, (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that:
In civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him is irrelevant, except in so far as such character appears from facts otherwise relevant.
I would be putting myself in danger of oversimplifying s 54 were I to paraphrase this section, as saying that “character” in a civil trial is irrelevant unless the facts show that it is relevant. There is a long route through which the origin and permutations of the stiffly-worded language of this legislative provision have slowly meandered until it can be read in that short form that I have set out above. But I think that it is not necessary for me, for the purposes of this case, to provide a lengthy exculpation of my reading of s 54. In his cross-examination of the defendant, Mr Khoo relentlessly reminded him of evidence from the criminal trial relating to his misappropriation of church funds. It was evident from the cross-examination what Mr Khoo had hoped to emphasise. He made that emphasis clear by his choice of words that the defendant was “surreptitiously siphoning out $5.1 million” from church funds towards his personal use in the purchase of condominium flats in Penang and Singapore, and not, as the defendant asserted, something he did “in accordance with canon law”. The question, thus, is whether these are the kinds of facts that would make the defendant’s character relevant within the meaning of s 54. I do not think so in this case. The key issue here is whether the property and money were gifts or not.
13        Nonetheless, I am of the view that there is one aspect concerning the defendant’s handling of the church funds that is a matter of interest to this court, although I am not required here to judge whether, and if so why, the moral compass of this priest became maladjusted. Those are not relevant questions for this court even if they do remain viable, or of interest, so far as the defendant’s church and his parishioners are concerned. The relevant connection between the defendant’s conduct in the criminal proceedings and the present action is this. The matters relating to the criminal case, including the acts for which he was charged, his plea of guilt, as well as his present testimony about them, such as his “reasons for pleading guilty”, set out at some length in his evidence-in-chief, are relevant in determining whether the defendant’s understanding of the meaning of fiduciary duty, and the doctrines of trust, was conventional or not. That has a direct bearing in this case because the defendant denied that he was holding the money and assets in trust for the plaintiff. The issue, hence, is whether he had a reasonable or correct understanding of that term and concept. It goes towards credibility. The facts established in the previous criminal proceedings are also relevant in establishing the manner in which the defendant was accustomed in dealing with money that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping. But to regard these as relevant for consideration does not necessarily lend assistance to the exercise of determining how much weight ought to be attached to them – that is another exercise.
14        In response, the defendant testified that he did no wrong in respect of the matters in the criminal proceedings because he had acted in accordance with canon law. Mr Low produced excerpts from two commentaries on canon law to support the defendant’s justification of his conduct there. One was entitled 
The Canon Law – Letter & Spirit
, published by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and 
Ireland
. The second was 
New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law
, a publication of the Canon Law Society of America. The defendant testified that the parish church did not have a legal status to hold property in its own name, and since he was the parish priest of the
 
Church 
of
 
St Theresa
, he was bound to invest excess church funds. But he could only do so by making the investments in his name. He testified that his interpretation of the relevant canon law justified his conduct, and which would have absolved him from any ecclesiastical as well as secular misconduct. Before proceeding further, I should address Mr Khoo’s objection to the reference to canon law. He submitted that canon law should only be admitted through expert witnesses. In so far as canon law is not the applicable law in our courts, it must be regarded just like a foreign law, admissible upon proof by experts. However, in the present case, the parties have not put these laws in issue in the sense that I am required to make a finding as to what principle or rule in canon law applied in the present case. On the contrary, neither counsel wished to quarrel over the force and effect of that law. Thus, the only relevance of the reference to canon law was to show that the defendant had relied on some of those principles in order to maintain his stand that he had done no wrong in respect of the matters in which he had been convicted. Whether he was right to do so (that is, to rely on those principles) is a separate matter, and one that is not in issue before me. However, the defendant faced a second problem. He had pleaded guilty and admitted to the Statement of Facts, which referred to the conduct that he now renounced. He therefore tried to explain to me why he had pleaded guilty. The clear impression he made in his evidence-in-chief was that he did so because various parties, including the local church authority, coerced him into it. Unless the plea and admissions are set aside, the defendant is bound by them.
15        Mr Khoo submitted that many instances of Mr Low’s submissions were in breach of the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 (1893) 6 R 67 in that those aspects were not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination. I have considered those passages in Mr Low’s submissions that Mr Khoo referred me to, and am of the view that I should not disregard them. I would prefer to consider them together with the entirety of the evidence. 
Browne v Dunn
 is a very old case, decided during a time when the evidence of the opposing parties was not disclosed to each other. The exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief in the modern civil trial ameliorates the mischief described by Lord Herschell LC in 
Browne v Dunn
, at 70. That case may still be relevant where a litigant wishes to rely on a hitherto undisclosed fact that is crucial and might on its own swing the favour of the court one way or the other. The matters raised by Mr Khoo do not, in my view, fall into this category. By way of example, Mr Khoo objected to Mr Low’s submission that the plaintiff ought to have handed 
Singapore
 
or Australian currencies instead of Malaysian shares to the defendant if she really wanted to have ready funds. I take this as a submission as to what inference I ought to draw. I think that Mr Low was entitled to make that submission. As it was, Mr Khoo had a ready reply to the inference that Mr Low had in mind. So I had taken the opposing arguments into consideration.
16        Throughout the trial, many questions were raised about the motives and the intentions of the plaintiff as well as the defendant. Some of the questions have been explicitly answered, though many of the answers given by the two litigants were diametrically opposed. Why would a person in the plaintiff’s circumstances wish to give a million dollars to a priest? Conversely, one might also ask: What did the plaintiff hope to achieve by asking the defendant to hold her money and property in trust for her? The plaintiff said that she thought that her money would be safe in the hands of a priest, especially one whom she had come to know and like. Intentions and motives of this nature cannot be ascertained by logic alone. On the contrary, some transactions between friends, as well as people who believe they know each other well, are like leaps of faith; they can be notoriously illogical. We can detect an inconsistent line when we ask why someone in the defendant’s situation and circumstances would resist the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant’s counsel opened his case by reading a passage from the Bible found in ch 10 of the Gospel of Matthew to the plaintiff – in that passage, the Christ of their common faith had exhorted the rich to forsake all their worldly goods, saying that it is easier for the camel to go through the eye of the needle than for the rich man to go to heaven. It was read by counsel for the purpose of emphasising the gift of generosity inherent in the plaintiff’s nature. To that extent, that emphasis was relevant because the plaintiff was indeed a generous person, and part of my duty in this case, is to determine the extent of that generosity. I find it difficult, however, to understand the above passage from the Bible fully, without seeing how it exempts the defendant himself. Ought not the same precept to apply to the one who ministers as it does the person ministered to? There may be a good, perhaps philanthropic, reason why the defendant fought so tenaciously to keep the wealth in question; but he had not told this court what that might be. So, with generosity and avarice, so inextricably intertwined in this case, encasing the plaintiff and defendant alike, the true motive and intention of the parties – and here I am referring to the full, undisguised state of mind – is not clearly discernible; yet that is the heart of this case, and finding that intention is what this court has to do. There are no fixed rules as to how this might be done, but one must not be too quick to ill-judge a person’s intention, or to dismiss a possibility on the basis that a right-thinking person would have intended otherwise, without making allowance for the possibility that even the most sure-footed may slip and stumble from time to time.
17        For example, in respect of one of the factual issues in this case, it will be seen that there could be two possible reasons why the plaintiff’s list of assets in her will did not include the Guinness shares. One possibility is that she had already given those shares away to the defendant. The other is that she had only listed those assets that were within her own possession, excluding those held in trust. What did the plaintiff have in mind when she wrote out that list? She said that it was only to let her executor know what assets she had with her. Since the defendant was to be her executor, he did not need to be reminded that he held some of her assets. Since the inferences to be drawn from the incontrovertible facts of the transfer of property and money can reasonably be in favour of either party, and there being no corroboration of the litigants by independent witnesses, on the balance, I am more inclined to accept the uncorroborated evidence of the plaintiff than that of the defendant. Much of what the defendant asserted in his evidence might possibly be true, but many established facts are against him. He had testified that he was holding money jointly with Chia Li Ling in trust for the parish church because the parish church could not make investments on its own. Chia Li Ling was not called to explain her role in those episodes. Her evidence would be relevant because it would have corroborated, and perhaps clarified that of the defendant’s own evidence, and to help me understand the defendant’s perception of trust property and gifts. That omission, taken together with the absence of support from the Catholic Church in respect of his idea of trust property, left me with only his word. Thus, faced with the simple, but crucial, question, “Do I believe the plaintiff or the defendant?”, I find myself reluctant to accept the defendant’s evidence without corroboration. Between the two uncorroborated testimonies, I would incline towards that of the plaintiff’s. I come to this conclusion without giving any piece of evidence special significance, or giving any specific evidence more weight than another, which is often possible, but not in this case.
18        For the reasons above, I find that the balance of probabilities lies in the plaintiff’s favour, and I, therefore, allow the plaintiff’s claim in full. Costs are to follow the event, and be taxed if not agreed.",2005-02-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

20th July 2012

Simon Harwood 

 

Judgment 

 
Background and submissions 
 

1.  This decision concerns two reports on the Mail’s Online website concerning 

inadmissible material relating to alleged earlier incidents of violence on the part 
of the defendant. 
 

2.  On 22 May 2012 I decided in a Ruling (handed down in writing) that the 

prosecution was not entitled to introduce evidence of two alleged previous 
incidents of bad character, namely: 
 

FIRST:  Material  relating  to  an  event  on  25th  May  2005  when  the 
defendant was allegedly involved with a number of other officers in the 
arrest  of  Mr.  Owusu‐Afriye.  It  is  alleged  he  used  unnecessary  force  by 
delivering a knee strike to the left side of Mr. Owusu‐Afriye’s torso, in the 
area of his kidneys. 
 
SECOND: Evidence relating to an incident on 24th November 2008 when 
the  defendant  was  involved  with  5  other  officers  in  stopping  and 
searching the vehicle of Mr. Junior Samms, an AA patrolman. The conduct 
of  the  defendant  is  said  to  have  been  the  worst  of  the  policemen  who 
had dealings with Mr. Samms in that it is alleged he twisted Mr. Samms’ 
arm when he was handcuffed and repeatedly told him to “shut up”.
--------
3.  I noted that:  

 

“[…] in support of the two incidents the prosecution have limited their 
application to calling two witnesses only: Mr Ward (a passing member of 
the public) as regards the incident on 25th May 2005 and Mr. Samms for 
the events on 24th November 2008. The Prosecution does not propose to 
call Mr. Owusu‐Afriye, Police Constables Calver, Jury, Leung and Wilson, 
Police Sergeant Paul and a doctor for the incident concerning Mr Owusu‐
Afriye and Police Constables Walker, Mitchell and Jackaman and Police 
Sergeant Bowman and a further officer for the incident concerning Mr 
Samms. The various police constables were present at both events (Police 
Sergeant Paul was also present when Mr Owusu‐Afriye was detained) and 
their statements in varying degrees significantly contradict the accounts 
of the two complainants. 

 

4.  Against that background, I concluded:  

 

“[…] I have no doubt that pursuant to section 101 (3) this material would 
have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the 
court  ought  not  to  admit  it.  The  jury  would  in  effect  have  to  conduct 
three  trials,  the  first  relating  to  the  index  offence  and  the  other  two 
concerning the accused’s alleged propensity to act in the manner alleged 
against  him  on  1st  April  2009.  The  mixed  factual  and  legal  issues  would 
become excessively complex, in that the jury would need to ensure that 
their  approach  to  the  legal  elements  of  the  index  offence  was  only 
properly  influenced  by  their  factual  findings  reached  to  the  criminal 
standard in relation to all three incidents. Given the facts on the central 
incident  are  not  necessarily  at  all  straightforward,  to  add  two  strongly 
disputed  additional  allegations  for  the  purposes  advanced  by  the 
prosecution would undoubtedly put the fairness of these proceedings in 
jeopardy.”  

 

5.  Notwithstanding that Ruling, prior to the commencement of this trial it was 

brought to my attention by the parties that a number of websites run by various 
newspapers and at least one broadcaster contained articles that were readily 
available and dated back to 2010, in which unproven allegations made against PC 
Harwood were rehearsed (these included the Mail, the Telegraph, the Mirror 
and Channel 4 News). By way of example, there continued to be readily available 
on the Mail’s Online website (certainly until late in the trial)                                                                         
the following extract that is taken from a longer article entitled “’Cover‐up’ 
storm over G20 death: Fury as DPP rules policeman who hit news vendor won’t 
be charged” (dated 23 July 2010):
--------
The PC who left under a cloud 
PC Simon Harwood, the officer who was accused of killing Ian Tomlinson, 
left the Met in controversial circumstances several years ago while facing 
misconduct proceedings over an alleged off‐duty road rage incident. 
 
The 43‐year‐old was allowed to retire on ill health grounds because of a 
leg or shoulder injury before the disciplinary case, which is said to have 
involved allegations of violence, it is said.  
 
But after surgery on his injury, he rejoined the force as a civilian operator, 
dispatching officers to calls, and then after being declared medically fit, 
was accepted to join Surrey Police as a PC.  
 
Later, despite the outstanding disciplinary proceedings, he transferred 
back to the Met and was deployed in the riot squad.  
 
Last night Scotland Yard refused to comment on the apparent vetting 
bungle. It said: “It is not appropriate to comment on the officer’s 
employment history‐until the completion of any criminal or misconduct 
proceedings.” 
 
But a source told a Sunday newspaper last year: ‘No former officer with 
an outstanding disciplinary matter should ever be given his job back.” 

 

6.  In addition, other websites such as “Facebook”, ”You Tube” and “38 degree” 

published ‘posts’ which shortly before the commencement of the trial contained 
details of, or referred to, various disciplinary allegations. There were also 
websites or blogs run by particular individuals in which a variety of contributors 
expressed their personal opinions on these issues.  

 
7.  In order to address these concerns, a letter I sent to the parties on 31 May 2012 

was forwarded by the Crown Prosecution Service to those responsible for the 
main websites that contain this material, in the following terms: 

 

I am the trial judge in this case. The defendant, a metropolitan police 
officer, is charged with the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson during an 
event on 1 April 2009, namely the violent protest in the City of London 
that coincided with the meeting of the G20 group of finance ministers and 
central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union. 
 
A ruling under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is in force, and I have 
attached the terms of the order to this letter.
--------
I am concerned about press reports and other material that remain 
available on the internet relating to accusations of bad behaviour that 
have been levelled against the accused that are separate from the 
incident on 1 April 2009 for which he will stand trial, and which are 
inadmissible. The relevant publications include (but this list is not 
exhaustive) i) press reports which were originally published in 2010 and 
which are accessible via various websites; ii) items on “Facebook”, “You 
Tube” and “38 degree” that include “posts” concerning disciplinary (and 
possibly other) allegations; and iii) material on websites (such as 
Wikipedia) or “blogs” on which individuals express their opinion (including 
the Ian Bone blog site, “Raewald” and “Unforgiven”). The websites run by 
newspapers and broadcasters include those hosted by The Telegraph, The 
Mirror, The Mail, The Guardian and Channel 4 News, although it is highly 
likely that this extends to other sources.  
 
Internet service providers, Bulletin Board Operators, Web Hosting Services 
and search engines (such as Google) will need to consider whether they 
are enabling the publication of this material.  
 
None of these separate allegations of bad behaviour will feature in the 
evidence in this case, in part because of a ruling that I handed down on 22 
May 2012 at Southwark Crown Court. 
 
The continued publication of this material on the internet, or elsewhere, 
prima facie constitutes a contempt of court within section 1 of the 
Contempt of Court Act 1981 and it is critical – particularly given the 
impending trial – the Order of the Court is complied with and the 
publication of this information ceases immediately. 
 
Although this material should be removed from the internet forthwith, I 
will hear submissions from any individual or body affected by the 
Contempt of Court Order who wishes to raise any relevant issues during 
the morning of the first day of the trial on 18 June 2012.  

 

 

 

8.  The order referred to in the letter was made on 17 October 2011 by Mr Justice 

Cooke, in the following terms: 

1.  The order made, under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, by 

the Coroner on 26 April 2011, in the inquest proceedings, is to be 
continued until further order of this Court. The order of 26 April is as 
follows: 

Further to the order made orally by the Coroner on 21 March 
2011, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that by virtue
--------
of Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 the publication 
of the Coroner’s ruling of 31 March 2011 and any legal argument 
in the absence of the jury on the topic with which the ruling is 
concerned and this order itself be postponed until further order 
within the proceedings of the inquest, on the ground that it is 
necessary for avoiding substantial risk of prejudice to the 
administration of justice in  these proceedings.  

 

2.  Additional to that order, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that 

publication of any information about PC Harwood’s personnel record is 
postponed until further order of this Court. This order is made on the 
ground that is necessary to do so to avoid a substantial risk of prejudice 
to the administration of justice in these proceedings pursuant to Section 
4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.   

 

 

9.  At a hearing I convened on 15 June 2012 to hear submissions from the parties 

and the media as to any further steps that should be taken by the court to 
address the continued availability of the inadmissible evidence on the internet, 
one of the issues that arose was whether articles and comments in this category 
constituted the material publication of information that had been lawfully 
prohibited by Cooke J’s order. Mr Millar Q.C., who represented a number of 
media organisations, submitted the order was unlawful and needed to be 
revised because it related to past reporting rather than relating to the 
proceedings themselves. I acceded to that submission, given that previous 
reports of earlier alleged misbehaviour cannot properly fall within the ambit of a 
power to postpone reports of the proceedings (namely, the trial), and in 
consequence, I revoked paragraph 2 of Cooke J’s Order.  
 

10. Thereafter, I set out in open court a short rehearsal of my views on this issue. I 
had concluded that two principal questions had arisen. The first was whether 
these publications came within the strict liability rule of section 1 of the 
Contempt of Court Act 1981 – namely, the “rule of law whereby conduct may be 
treated as a contempt of court as tending to interfere with the course of justice 
in particular legal proceedings regardless of intent to do so” – because they are 
publications addressed to the public at large or to a section of the public, and 
because they will “create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the 
proceedings in question will be seriously […] prejudiced” (see section 1 and 
section 2 Contempt of Court Act 1981). And, second, whether these publications 
constituted a contempt in the face of the court. 

11. As to the first of those questions, without attempting finally to determine the 

issue for the purposes of these proceedings, I expressed the view that the 
internet articles are “publications” for the reasons set out by Lord Osborne in
--------
Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs (No2) 2001 Scot (D) 
30/10; 2002 S.L.T. 139. At paragraph 22, the judge in that case observed: 

 

It appears to me unrealistic to make a distinction between the 
moment when the material is first published on the web site and the 
succeeding period of time when it is available for access on demand 
by members of the public. It appears to me that the better view is that 
the situation affecting the web site may be compared with a situation 
in which a book or other printed material is continuously on sale and 
available to the public. During that whole period, I consider that it 
would be proper to conclude that the material was being published. 

12. Addressing whether these publications created a substantial risk that the 

proceedings would be seriously prejudiced, I indicated my view that although 
judicial directions to the jury are usually effective in ensuring the fair trial of the 
accused – in this instance by way of an absolute prohibition on any researches 
into the case or the accused, particularly on the internet – the court should 
nonetheless take all sensible steps to diminish the risk that jurors may read 
inadmissible and prejudicial material. In this context, I noted that it is undisputed 
that the details of the previous allegations levelled at PC Harwood were 
markedly prejudicial. I intended to give (and I gave) the jury a strong warning not 
to use the internet in this regard – a warning that the court is entitled to expect 
will be followed – but applying the approach of Moses LJ in Her Majesty’s 
Attorney General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers 
Ltd [2011] EWHC 418 (Admin), I concluded that if this material remained on the 
web and it reached the attention of one or more jurors, it would create a 
seriously arguable ground of appeal. Although the law assumes that a judge, by 
making effective orders, thereby secures a safe verdict (in the circumstances of a 
conviction) that does not negate the contempt caused by the (continued) 
publication of material that created a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing the 
proceedings.  
 

13. I highlighted on 15 June 2012 that it was clear, therefore, that this was not a case 

in which the court was postponing publication of a report of proceedings under 
section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Instead, as I viewed the matter at 
that stage on the basis of the submissions of the parties and Mr Millar, the court 
was confronting the kind of rare situation contemplated by Lawton LJ in Balogh v 
St.Albans Crown Court 1975 QB 73, at page 93 when he observed that a trial 
judge should only resort to the summary and – as he described it – draconian 
jurisdiction of summary contempt proceedings “for the purpose of ensuring that 
a trial in progress or about to start can be brought to a proper and dignified end 
without disturbance and with a fair chance of a just verdict or judgment” (page 
93 letter A). Lawton LJ gave a series of examples, as follows:
--------
The exercise of judicial discretion in this way can be illustrated by 
reference to the kinds of contempt which are most frequently 
witnessed by or reported to judges: witnesses and jurors duly 
summoned who refuse to attend court; witnesses duly sworn who 
refuse to answer proper questions; persons in court who interrupt the 
proceedings by insulting the judge, shouting or otherwise making a 
disturbance; persons in court who assault or attempt to assault or 
threaten the judge or any officers of the court whose presence is 
necessary; persons in or out of court who threaten those about to give 
evidence or who have given evidence; persons in or out of court who 
threaten or bribe or attempt to bribe jurors or interfere with their 
coming to court; persons out of court who publish comments about a 
trial going on by revealing a defendant's criminal record when the 
rules of evidence exclude it. 

 
14. I indicated that the last example – revealing a defendant’s criminal record – 

closely matched the situation in the present trial, even allowing for the obvious 
difference as to whether there had been a concluded criminal trial. In the 
context of the violence alleged against Mr Harwood in this trial, these previous 
allegations of violent behaviour leading to misconduct proceedings in the late 
1990s and in 2004 would have had a like effect as the jury reading about 
previous criminal convictions for violence. At that stage, by way of example, 
material on the Telegraph’s website referred to these as two previous inquiries 
into allegations of aggression, and one of them is widely reported to have 
concerned an incident of “road rage” on the part of the defendant. Although the 
second allegation was in some instances reported as not having been 
substantiated by the investigating body, the cumulative reporting of the 
allegations of previous violence on his part created an impression that, in my 
judgment, was not dissimilar to the situation that arises when an accused’s 
previous convictions are improperly revealed.  
 

15. Mr Millar submitted that numerous issues of principle may arise if I were to seek 
to use the Court’s summary powers in this context, but I nonetheless expressed 
the view on 15 June 2012 that as regards publishers within the jurisdiction (such 
as domestic newspapers, broadcasters, bloggers etc.) the position is clear, for 
the reasons just rehearsed. As a result, I stated that if this material was not 
removed by 8.00 am on Monday 18 June 2012 when the jurors who may serve 
on this trial were expected to begin arriving at Southwark Crown Court, those 
responsible were at risk of being in contempt of court.  

16. Additionally, I raised on 15 June 2012 the issue of other individuals who are 

responsible for publishing this material from outside the jurisdiction, along with 
those who provide “caching”, “hosting” or search facilities. I indicated to counsel 
that I needed careful assistance (including possibly expert evidence) as to what,
--------
if any, steps are available to a judge in these circumstances and I asked the 
prosecution and defence to collaborate as a matter of urgency in order to put 
me in a position of being able to deal with this aspect of the prejudicial 
publishing.  

17. As an additional step, I asked the prosecution to use every effort to secure 

voluntary compliance on the part of all concerned, whether within or without 
the jurisdiction. I invited the Attorney General to assist in the process of inviting 
Wikipedia to amend the entry on the relevant web page (given internet searches 
on this subject usually place the Wikipedia entry as one of the first, and at that 
stage it contained references to the disciplinary proceedings). 

18. Finally, on 15 June 2012 I expressed my hope that those responsible for these 
articles – certainly within the jurisdiction – would comply voluntarily with the 
spirit of the views that I expressed, given, in the main, they are major 
broadcasters or publishers.  

19. Once the trial began on Monday 18 June 2012, save for some slight delays in 

removing a small number references to the inadmissible material, broadly 
speaking the press, Wikipedia, the broadcasters and most “bloggers” had 
complied with my request. However, two exceptions were later brought to my 
attention. The Mail Online maintained two articles (certainly for a period during 
the trial), dated 23 July 2010 [5] and 4 September 2010, as follows: 

4 September 2010 
PC Harwood, a member of Scotland Yard’s Territorial Support Group, left 
the Metropolitan Police a decade ago, after an alleged off‐duty road‐rage 
incident for which he was due to face a misconduct hearing, before 
instead retiring on medical grounds.  
 
In 2003 he won a job with Surrey Police, where he was accused of using 
excessive force. He returned to the Met in 2004.  

20.  It followed that the only outstanding issue that I needed to address in the 

closing stages of the trial was what steps, if any, should the court take as regards 
the stance adopted by Associated Newspapers Limited in failing to comply with 
the observations I made on 15 June 2012 and the letter that was circulated. Mr 
Caplan Q.C. submitted that it would be of assistance if the matter could be 
resolved by way of a formal order.  
 

21. On 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two articles in open court, and I 

indicated that these reasons would follow.
--------
22. Mr Caplan, who appeared to argue the matter on 5 July 2012, and by reference 
to his written submissions that principally addressed the application of the strict 
liability rule, advanced the following principal propositions: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

The Contempt of Court Act 1981 (“CCA”) is concerned with 
material that is published on a contemporary basis and offered to 
readers, and this does not cover items that are stored in “an 
online archive” and which can only be accessed following a 
specific search. 
 
The remarks of Lord Osborne, set out above [11], when he 
concluded that material in an online archive was continuously 
being published for the purposes of the CCA from the moment of 
publication were obiter and are wrong.  

The summary procedure envisaged in Balogh v St Albans Crown 
Court [13] does not have “any application to the strict liability 
rule”. It was noted that this authority antedates the Contempt of 
Court Act and the Human Rights Act 1998, and it was argued that 
proceedings under the strict liability rule can only be brought by 
the Attorney General pursuant to section 7. Thereafter, the issue 
of whether there has been a breach is a value judgment for the 
Administrative Court. Mr Caplan highlighted that the breach of 
the strict liability rule (unlike contempts in the face of the court) 
does not involve an intention to interfere with the course of the 
trial or the deliberate breach of a court order.   

Our system of criminal justice depends on trusting jurors to abide 
by their oath and any judicial directions. Any interference with 
freedom expression must be proportionate and necessary (Article 
10(2) ECHR). In this regard it was argued that it is neither 
proportionate nor necessary to require online archives to be 
sanitised because disobedient jurors might choose to access 
prejudicial material. Such a requirement would not be practical 
and it would have a damaging effect on the future of such 
archives, which are, inter alia, a valuable tool for researchers and 
academics. Mr Caplan relied on the Law Commission's Scoping 
Study No 2 (December 2002) on defamation and the internet in 
which it was indicated ""that it is not practically possible to 
monitor all criminal trials in the country and subsequently to 
remove from internet archives any potentially prejudicial 
material"" (para 5.25). It was suggested that the proportionate 
response is to direct the jurors not to conduct internet research
--------
regarding the case which they are trying in the same way that 
they are directed not to discuss the case outside of the jury room.  

v) 

vi) 

The CCA does not proscribe the publication of prejudicial material 
simpliciter but only the publication of material that creates a 
substantial risk of prejudice. The point was made that 
contemporary publications are to be distinguished from online 
archives because of the need with the latter to apply search 
criteria. 

The Court’s summary powers are not engaged on the facts of this 
case.  

23. On the issue of the steps, if any, that the court should take as regards any 

material that it considers necessary to diminish the risk that jurors may read 
inadmissible and prejudicial reports, Mr Caplan submitted that: 
 

[…] either the material in question constitutes an anticipated contempt 
(in which case an application for an injunction to the High Court may be 
appropriate) or it constitutes an arguable breach of the strict liability rule 
(in which case it is for the AG to decide whether to institute proceedings 
and to apply to the High Court). With regard to applications for an 
injunction, Arlidge Eady and Smith on “Contempt” 4th Ed at paras 6.1 and 
6.2 state that it “will generally be inappropriate for trial judges of the 
Crown Court to entertain applications of this kind … It could rarely be said 
to be necessary, through pressure of time, to take such a step for the 
purpose of protecting the integrity of the trial”.   

 

24. Ms Michalos was instructed by the CPS to assist the court on the approach to be 
taken to the various sources of information that have remained available on the 
internet, and she highlighted that, for the purposes of the CCA, the main issues 
are whether any particular site classes as a “publisher” (section 2(1)) and the 
extent to which the publication creates a substantial risk that the course of 
justice in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced (section 2(2)). 
Additionally, it was pointed out that under section 3(3) it is necessary, for the 
purposes of strict liability, for the proceedings to have been active at the time of 
publication.  
 

25. With social networking sites, she expressed the view that those that simply 

provide a platform for other users (such as Google) are unlikely to be regarded 
as publishers (but this general statement was somewhat qualified, as set out 
below). She argued that all sites that are essentially facilitators, such as Facebook 
and YouTube, are likely to be treated in the same way. Similarly, with search 
engines and internet service providers (ISPs), she submitted that “the current
--------
state of the law strongly suggests that search engines and mere service 
providers” (e.g. BT and Tiscali who provide access to the internet) “would not be 
held liable for strict liability contempt because they would not be regarded as 
publishers”. In the context of defamation, Ms Michalos suggested that at 
common law if bodies of this kind provide no more than a passive role in 
facilitating postings on the internet, they are not deemed to be a publisher (Bunt 
v Tilley [2006] EWHC 407 (QB); [2006] 3 AER 336). 
 

26.  By way of at least a partial qualification to this general submission, Ms Michalos 
argued that if the ISP is on notice of the material in question then it is possible it 
will be held to be a publisher, in that in determining responsibility the state of a 
defendant’s knowledge could be an important factor. My attention was drawn to 
developing jurisprudence involving Google. In Metropolitan International Schools 
(t/as Train2Game) v Designtechnica & Google [2009] EWHC 1765 Eady J held 
that Google was a mere facilitator rather than a publisher, and that “publication” 
involves a mental element, and this was the case even though Google had taken 
steps to ensure that certain URLs were blocked: the court held that it was 
unrealistic to attribute responsibility for publication to Google ([57] and [64]). 
However, in Davison v Habeeb & others [2011] EWHC 3031, it was decided (HHJ 
Parkes, sitting as a High Court judge) that it was arguable that Google was a 
publisher, rather than a mere facilitator, if it was notified that particular material 
was appearing on a virtual noticeboard for which it was responsible [42]. Eady J 
returned to this general area in Tamiz v Google Inc [2012] EWHC 449 (QB) when 
he held that Google Inc. was not a publisher at common law in respect of Google 
blogs because it was a provider or facilitator. Whilst he held that the mere fact 
that it had been notified of a complaint did not immediately convert its status or 
role into that of a publisher ([38]), he indicated that a decision in this area may 
be fact sensitive ([33]). Eady J set out that liability may turn on the extent to 
which the relevant ISP has knowledge of the words complained of, their illegality 
or potential illegality or the extent to which it has control over publication ([33]). 

27. On the basis of this material, it was submitted by Ms Michalos that unless there 

 

is a reasonably high degree of “active moderation” operated by the site, “it is 
unlikely that an individual social media site would be held to be a publisher for 
strict liability purposes. This is because in most cases there will be an absence of 
the mental element that the authorities suggest is required to render someone a 
publisher.” However, Ms Michalos suggested that it is arguable that once specific 
objectionable material has been drawn to the website’s attention, it becomes a 
publisher for the purposes of strict liability, particularly if – possibly only if – 
specific material on identified web pages are drawn to the company’s attention.  
 

28. In a similar vein, Ms Michalos argued that a similar approach is likely to apply to 

any alleged breaches of a section 4(2) order. Her argument is that “(o)nce 
express knowledge of a court order could be established and attributed to the
--------
website, it seems to be that there are better prospects of establishing that a 
social networking site like Facebook has made a publication in breach of s. 4(2) 
than for a search engine”. This, it is suggested, is subject to a final determination 
as to whether a social networking site is to be regarded as a publisher. It is 
argued that this may be resolved by way of a finding that they are publishers on 
the basis that the site is providing the means of publication and it has the power 
to stop it.  

29. As to “blogs” and other similar content providers, Ms Michalos drew my 

attention to certain practical difficulties, which include identifying individual 
users and the large number that the court would need to deal with. That said, it 
is suggested that it is clear that an individual user who places material on a 
webpage or blog plainly publishes the material (see AG v Pelling [2005] EWCH 
414 (Admin); [2005] Fam Law 854). 

30. Ms Michalos contended that under Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce 

(EC Directive) Regulations 2002, most providers of services such as Google blogs 
will have a defence to criminal sanctions for contempt unless there has been 
effective – meaning highly specific – notification of the objectionable material.  

31. Ms Michalos suggested that material published by the general media or in blog 
publications do not fall within the normal understanding of contempt in the face 
of the court as they are removed in terms of time and physical proximity. Whilst 
Ms Michalos accepted in argument that there may be examples of publications 
that could amount to a contempt of this kind – “for example, media publications 
in flagrant disregard of court order or during a trial, publication of past 
convictions in a national newspaper” – she did not accept that the publications 
here qualify, on the grounds that they are “more removed and historic” and they 
in many instances would require a search to find the prohibited material.  

32. In any event, Ms Michalos contended that in this area it would be preferable, 
first, to summon the publisher to the Crown Court to explain its stance, and, if 
the answer is unsatisfactory, thereafter to refer the matter to the Attorney 
General for prosecution. In particular, she argued that given the difficulties in 
establishing strict liability contempt as against the various categories of potential 
contemnor, “it would be unwise to proceed on a summary basis”.  

33. As to the powers of the Crown Court, Ms Michalos reminded me that by section 

45(4) of the Senior Courts Act 1981: 

[…] the Crown Court shall, in relation to […] any contempt of court, the 
enforcement of its orders and all other matters incidental to its 
jurisdiction, have the like powers, rights, privileges and authority as the 
High Court.
--------
34. Aikens J used this provision when he granted an injunction to restrain a 
threatened contempt (Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [2002] EMLR 184).  
 

35. Given the comprehensive research and assistance provided by Ms Michalos, it is 

useful to set out her overarching conclusion:  

In my opinion, if the Court considers that continuing internet publication 
of historic material is likely to interfere with the administration of justice 
or  cause  prejudice  to  an  ongoing  trial,  the  proper  course  is  for  an 
application  to  be  made  for  an  injunction  against  the  relevant  media 
organisations in the High Court that specifically identifies the material to 
be enjoined and is not unnecessarily wide. If an injunction were granted 
and served, this brings with it a potential advantage of being able to bring 
overseas publishers within the realm of civil contempt if they disobey. It 
may remain to some extent a theoretical advantage as there would still 
be  practical  difficulties  with  enforcement.  However,  in  my  experience, 
reputable corporations beyond the jurisdiction do tend to co‐operate and 
take down material that is prohibited by a court order. 
 

Discussion and conclusions 

36. Although a number of important questions in this general area have been 
canvassed in the submissions of counsel, I have avoided the temptation of 
attempting to resolve issues which are, or have become, irrelevant or which 
have been resolved without the need for any, or any additional, indication or 
order from the court. As set out above, given the cooperative stance of the 
media, the only items that I need to address are the two articles that remained 
on the Mail’s Online website after 18 June 2012. Although one “blog” continued 
to rehearse elements of the inadmissible material, I have not been provided with 
any further details about this suggested publication and I have not received any 
submissions as to how the court should approach the continued availability of 
this prejudicial information.  
 
Are the two articles in the Mail On line “publications” for the purposes of CCA 
section 2(1)? 

37. Publication is defined in section 2(1) CCA as including “any speech, writing, 

programme included in a cable programme service or other communication in 
whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large or any section of the 
public”. I remain of the view that the words “at the time of the publication” in 
section 2(3) encompasses the entire period during which the material is available 
on a website from the moment of its first appearance through to when it was 
withdrawn (see Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs 
supra and Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [2001] QB 201 at 208 – 209). The
--------
distinction Mr Caplan sought to draw between current and archived reports is 
less clear than he suggested in argument. Anyone looking for contemporary 
reports of an ongoing trial will often do so by typing in search terms that are 
likely to reveal a mix of contemporary and earlier information. The “archived” 
material, certainly on the Mail’s Online site, remained readily available, and it 
was revealed by a general search for reports involving PC Harwood or Ian 
Tomlinson. A juror seeking contemporary information could easily have ended 
up viewing the reports that included references to the earlier allegations, 
without necessarily having set out to defy the court’s direction not to conduct 
research. Accordingly, in my judgment the two articles provided by the Mail 
Online continued to be “published” whilst the proceedings were active.   

Do the two articles in the Mail Online create a substantial risk that the course of 
justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced? 

38. As one of the two central questions in the case (the second was causation), the 

jury were directed to consider – when determining whether the push was a 
reasonable use of force – the defendant’s state of mind at the time, and whether 
his actions were guided by his genuine belief as to what was necessary. At the 
heart of that question self‐evidently lay the jury’s assessment of the defendant’s 
honesty (he gave evidence during the trial) and whether his description of only 
taking such steps as he believed were necessary was truthful. If jurors had 
accidentally discovered (in the circumstances I have described above) that he 
had an alleged history of violent and irrational behaviour, their judgment on the 
issue of his honest belief was likely to have been prejudiced. This was highly 
damaging material that went directly to one of the two cardinal issues in the 
case.  
 

39. As I have already indicated, both articles were extremely easy to find on the 

newspaper’s website, and I have been guided by the line of authority that it is 
sufficient for a finding of contempt that the court makes the assumption that if 
the offending publication reached the attention of a juror, this would have 
created a seriously arguable ground of appeal (see Her Majesty’s Attorney 
General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers Ltd 
above). As just indicated, a juror looking for contemporary articles on the trial 
(which is entirely permissible) could, with little effort or by accident, have come 
across either of these articles, and accordingly I am of the view that their 
publication constituted a substantial risk of impeding or prejudicing the course of 
justice. 

What steps should the court take? 

40. The approach to be taken by the court will always depend on the circumstances. 
It may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Attorney General for a possible 
prosecution or to suggest to the party that is troubled by the continuing 
publication that it should consider making an application to the High Court for an
--------
injunction. The circumstances will be infinitely various, but if the Crown Court is 
to resolve the issue, its ability to deal with matter effectively and fairly is critical. 
The Crown Court judge will usually have a good understanding of the issues in 
the case and the likely impact of the information if read by a juror; there may be 
time constraints, with an impending trial that would be prejudiced if delayed; 
and this issue will usually be of greatest concern to the defendant who, 
particularly if funded by the Legal Services Commission, may not be able to meet 
the costs of an approach to the High Court.  
 

41. The circumstances relating to these two publications were straightforward. The 

publisher is based in the UK and was readily identifiable; the material 
complained about was equally clear (two on‐line news articles); I reached 
conclusions without difficulty, on the basis of my involvement in the case, as to 
its potential to cause prejudice; and this debate originally occurred in the 
context of a trial that was about to start, and this particular issue only 
crystallised whilst it was ongoing. In these circumstances, as trial judge I 
considered that I was well placed to deal with the problem, and any other 
remedy was likely to cause delay, expense and prejudice to the defendant and 
the witnesses (viz. an application to the High Court), or it may be ineffective to 
prevent prejudice to the trial (viz. a prosecution by the Attorney General). 

42. Section 45 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 gives the Crown Court the same 

power and authority as the High Court as regards any contempt of court. Aikens 
J in Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd indicated at [23]:  

There is no general power in the Crown Court to grant injunctions. But I 
am satisfied that the Crown Court has the power to grant an injunction to 
restrain a threatened contempt of court in relation to a matter that is 
before the Crown Court in question. Whether an injunction should be 
granted will depend, of course, on whether all the conditions are fulfilled 
in the case at issue.  

43. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the two publications constitute a 

contempt of court under the strict liability rule. I am equally certain that issuing 
an injunction for the relatively short period of this trial was necessary and 
proportionate, and that in taking this step I was not acting in a way that is 
incompatible with the right of freedom of expression under Article 10(1) of the 
European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. This order, in my judgment, was necessary under Article 10(2). The 
means employed (ordering the removal of two articles for a short period of time) 
was proportionate to the need I have identified (ensuring the fair trial of the 
accused by avoiding serious prejudice). I had in mind that injunctions of this kind 
are rarely appropriate, but in the instant case the threat was specific and could 
be satisfactorily defined, and the failure to grant this injunction ran the risk of far
--------
greater prejudice than if I granted the injunction (to paraphrase Aikens J in Ex p. 
HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [35]). 
 

44. In all the circumstances, on 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two 

articles. Since the trial is now at a close, it is clearly unnecessary for the Court to 
consider resorting to its summary contempt powers.",2012-07-24 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

on appeal from
the court of appeal for ontario

 

Criminal law — Trial — Verdicts — Accused convicted of several
offences — Fresh expert evidence available after convictions upheld on appeal
discrediting Crown witnesses — Whether verdicts would necessarily have been the
same — Whether manslaughter conviction should be substituted for conviction for
murder — Whether accused should be acquitted of murder and criminal negligence
causing death.

 








The accused, M and A, were convicted of offences committed against their
infant son.  M was convicted of second degree murder, aggravated assault and
assault causing bodily harm; A, of criminal negligence causing death and
failure to provide the necessaries of life.  The Court of Appeal upheld their
convictions.  Following the appeal, expert opinions by P and another expert
became available.  This fresh evidence adduced before this Court discredits
evidence given by S, an expert called by the Crown, and renders unreliable
evidence given by C, a Crown witness.

 

Held:  The appeals should be allowed. 

 

The convictions of the accused should be set aside and a new trial
ordered with respect to the offences of which M and A were convicted.  S’s
evidence, which is now conceded to be unreliable, was central to the Crown’s
case.  S’s evidence may have influenced the jury’s conclusion on both the
causation and intent elements of the murder charge.  It would therefore be
inappropriate to substitute a conviction for manslaughter for M’s conviction
for murder.  Acquittals on the counts of murder and criminal negligence causing
death would also not be appropriate because it cannot be said that a properly
instructed jury, acting reasonably, could not find the accused guilty of the
homicide‑related offences based on the remaining evidence.  Lastly,
although the fresh evidence relates mainly to the convictions for murder and
criminal negligence causing death, it nonetheless bears as well, albeit to a
lesser degree, on the other counts, and it would be speculative and unsafe to
conclude that any of the verdicts would necessarily have been the same but for
S’s evidence.  To attempt at this stage to insulate the effect of S’s evidence
on one count from its possible effect on the others would amount to an
unwarranted exercise in appellate speculation.  [5-7] [13-14]

James Lockyer, for the appellant Anisa Trotta.

 

Lucy Cecchetto, for the respondent.

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

Fish J. — 

 

                                                                              I

 

1                                  
Marco Trotta and his wife Anisa Trotta stand convicted of culpable
homicide and other offences, all concerning the short life and tragic death of
their infant son Paolo.

 

2                                  
At the conclusion of their joint trial before judge and jury, Marco
Trotta was found guilty of second degree murder, aggravated assault and assault
causing bodily harm; Anisa Trotta, of criminal negligence causing death and
failure to provide the necessaries of life.  Their convictions were upheld by
the Court of Appeal for Ontario ((2004), 191 O.A.C. 322).

 








3                                  
The outcome of their present appeals to this Court depends on fresh
evidence available neither at the time of trial nor when their convictions were
upheld by the Court of Appeal.  We have concluded that a new trial must be had
on all counts.  It would therefore be inappropriate to say more about either
the fresh evidence or the evidence at trial than is necessary to explain our
decision.

 

II

 

4                                  
Essentially, the fresh evidence — mainly the expert opinions of Dr.
Michael Pollanen and Dr. Simon Avis — discredits the evidence given at trial by
Dr. Charles Smith, an expert called by the Crown.  And the evidence of a second
Crown witness at trial, Dr. David Chan, has been rendered unreliable as a
result.

 

5                                  
It is conceded by the Crown that the fresh evidence should be admitted
and that Marco Trotta’s conviction on the murder charge cannot stand.  With
respect to that count, however, the Crown urges us to substitute a conviction
for manslaughter instead of ordering a new trial. The Crown contends that the
impugned evidence of Dr. Smith could have affected the jury’s finding on the
fault element, or mens rea, that distinguishes murder from manslaughter,
but not on the actus reus, or element of causation common to both
offences.  We do not find this submission persuasive.  On the contrary, we
believe that the evidence of Dr. Smith may well have influenced the jury’s
conclusion on both essential elements of the murder charge — that Mr.
Trotta caused Paolo’s death and that he did so intentionally.

 








6                                  
In the Crown’s view, moreover, the fresh evidence has no bearing on any
of the other convictions of either appellant.  We are therefore urged by the
Crown to dismiss the appeals in respect of those convictions.  As we shall
presently see, this submission fails as well.  We recognize that the fresh
evidence adduced in this Court relates mainly to the appellants’ convictions
for murder and criminal negligence causing death.  It nonetheless bears as
well, albeit to a lesser degree, on the other counts.

 

7                                  
Both appellants, on the other hand, seek acquittals on the counts of
murder and criminal negligence causing death, and urge us to order a new trial
only on the remaining counts.  We are satisfied that acquittals would at this
stage be inappropriate, since we are not prepared to say that there remains no
evidence upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could find
the appellants guilty of the homicide-related offences of which they were
convicted at trial.

 

III 

 

8                                  
It was the position of the Crown at trial that Marco Trotta repeatedly
assaulted Paolo from shortly after his birth in September 1992 until his death
in late May 1993, and that Paolo’s death resulted from a final assault sometime
shortly before he died.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge summarized
the Crown’s position this way:

 

Only by that evidence led at this trial which you accept does the Crown
seek to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Marco Trotta engaged in a
pattern of abuse, a mode of assaultive behaviour towards his infant son for the
duration of that short life and not only did his violent actions endanger the
life of Paolo by such aggravated assaultive behaviour as in count two, and
actually cause bodily harm to him by the continuing assaults, count three, but
they escalate[d] to such a degree after May 6th, 1993, that they culminated in
his murder by May 29th, 1993, and that is count one.

 








9                                  
Moreover, in considering the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict on the
murder count, the Court of Appeal expressly noted the potential link between
the evidence of lifetime abuse and the death of Paolo, and concluded (at para.
31):

 

There was cogent, if not overwhelming, evidence that
Paolo was a battered child and that Marco was his abuser.  On the evidence, the
jury could find that the physical abuse escalated during Paolo’s life and
continued until very shortly before Paolo’s death.  There was evidence that
Paolo’s death was not the result of any disease process, natural causes (e.g.
SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]) or accidental
trauma.  Dr. Smith’s evidence indicated that his death was consistent with head
trauma and/or asphyxia, both of which could occur as a result of an assault.  On
the totality of this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that the
pattern of abuse of Paolo by Marco culminated in Paolo’s death at the hands of
Marco.  This finding was available even if the jury could not decide the exact
nature of the final assault. [Emphasis added.]

 

10                              
Again, in the words of the Court of Appeal (at para. 84):

 

The Crown relied on [Dr. Smith’s] evidence to eliminate certain
possibilities (e.g. disease and SIDS) and to point to the most likely
possibilities, head trauma and/or asphyxiation.  The Crown contended that when
Dr. Smith’s evidence was put with the rest of the evidence of ongoing abuse,
the resulting “big picture” left no doubt that Paolo died at the hands of his
father. [Emphasis added.]

 

11                              
The Court of Appeal identified certain errors committed by the trial
judge in his conduct of the trial and in his charge to the jury.  He was found
to have erred in admitting some of the evidence concerning Marco Trotta’s
demeanour.  The judge’s instruction on causation was described as “unfocussed”
and he was found to have made an “inappropriate” remark in his charge to the
jury (paras. 58 and 81).  Finally, with respect to a factual error made by the
trial judge, the Court of Appeal stated (at para. 91):

 








The factual error made by the trial judge in his review of Dr. Smith’s
evidence was significant.  The error related to an important part of the
evidence given by an important witness.  The trial judge also repeated the
error on one other occasion in the course of his instructions.  

 

 

The Court of
Appeal was nonetheless satisfied that none of these errors could have affected
either the fairness or the outcome of the trial.

 

12                              
As mentioned at the outset, however, neither the trial judge nor the
Court of Appeal had the benefit of the fresh evidence adduced in this Court. 
That evidence places in a fresh light the trial judge’s unfortunate errors and
the conclusion of the Court of Appeal as to their effect on the outcome of the
trial.

 

IV

 

13                              
In deciding that a new trial must be had on all the counts, we bear in
mind particularly:

 

(1)  the central importance of Dr. Smith’s evidence to the Crown’s case
at trial;

 

(2)  the Crown’s position throughout the trial as to the relationship
between the charges;

 

(3)  that the factual error made by the trial judge in his review of Dr.
Smith’s evidence was found by the Court of Appeal to be significant, and later
repeated;

 








(4)  that Dr. Smith’s evidence is now conceded to be unreliable;

 

(5)  that the Court of Appeal identified several errors made at trial
that related not only to the homicide charges, but to the other counts as well;

 

(6)  the fact that the Crown chose to proceed on all the counts against
both accused at a single trial — and alleged, moreover, that all five
offences had occurred within an overlapping time frame;

 

(7)  that Dr. Smith testified not only as to the cause of Paolo’s death —
the basis of the homicide charges — but also as to Paolo’s previous injuries,
the basis of the other counts;

 

(8)  that it is impossible to determine what effect Dr. Smith’s evidence
(and that of Dr. Chan) had on the jury’s evaluation of the Trottas’ credibility
with respect to their out of court explanations as to those injuries;

 

(9)  the fact that these explanations were put into evidence by the Crown
as part of its case against the appellants; and

 

(10)  that, understandably, the trial judge did not instruct the jury to
limit its consideration of the evidence of Dr. Smith and Dr. Chan to the
homicide counts.

 








14                              
In this light, we think it neither safe nor sound to conclude that the
verdicts on any of the charges would necessarily have been the same but for Dr.
Smith’s successfully impugned evidence.  To attempt at this stage to insulate
the effect of Dr. Smith’s evidence on one count from its possible effect on the
others would amount to an unwarranted exercise in appellate speculation.

 

15                              
Plainly, then, if a new trial must be had, as we think it must, the
preferable course is to order an untainted trial on all counts.

 

V

 

16                              
For all of these reasons, both appeals are allowed, the appellants’
convictions are set aside, and a new trial is ordered with respect to the
offences of which they were convicted.

 

17                              
Having reached that conclusion for the reasons given, we find it is
unnecessary to consider the issue of post-conviction disclosure raised by the
appellants.  That issue has become entirely moot and should therefore be left
for another day.

The  jury  verdicts  against  the  appellant  and  Marlow  reflect  substantial 

GLEESON CJ, HAYNE AND HEYDON JJ.   The appellant appeals against the 
dismissal  by  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  of  Tasmania  of  his  appeal  against 
conviction by a jury sitting in the Supreme Court of Tasmania1.  The appellant 
was  charged  with  murdering  Tony  George  Tanner  on  or  about  23  November 
1990.  He was tried with Michael John Marlow (""Marlow""), whom the jury also 
convicted  of  murder,  and  Gary  Hilton  Williams  (""Williams""),  whom  the  jury 
acquitted both of murder and of being an accessory after the fact.   
 
The background 
 
 
acceptance of the following Crown case.   
 
 
The  Crown  contended  that  Marlow  disliked  the  victim  for  giving  the 
police information about an incident of bungled stealing in 1987.   As a result, 
Marlow  was  sentenced  to  eight  months  imprisonment  after  pleading  guilty  to 
being an accessory after the fact.  The Crown also contended that the appellant 
hated the victim for being a police informant.   
 
 
On the afternoon of 23 November 1990, the victim made an arrangement 
to meet the appellant and set out to fulfil it.  There is no evidence that he was 
ever seen alive again except by the person or persons who murdered him.  Paul 
Paget  (""Paget"")  gave  evidence  that  that  evening  he  was  present  at  a  meeting 
between  the  appellant,  Marlow  and  Williams,  at  which  it  was  agreed  that  the 
appellant would lure the victim to a logging site where the appellant had been 
working.  The plan was for Marlow to murder the victim at that place.  The role 
of Williams, according to the evidence of Paget about which the jury must have 
experienced a reasonable doubt, was to drive the victim's car to the airport and 
leave it there, so as to suggest that the victim had departed from Tasmania.   
 
 
Later, in the early hours of the morning, according to Paget, Marlow said 
that he had killed the victim with a shotgun for informing on him, and that the 
victim had been buried in a deep hole dug by the appellant with an excavator.   
 
 
On 25 November 1999 the appellant said to the police that he and Marlow 
had murdered the victim.  On 4 March 2000 during a video-recorded interview, 
although he accepted that he had confessed in this way, the appellant said that the 
confession was false and offered certain explanations for having made it.  While 
Marlow  made  no  admissions  to  the  police,  he  did  make  statements  to  other 
people in the years between 1990-2000 which could be treated as admissions.

In March 2000 the victim's body was found with shotgun wounds in a hole 
which could only have been dug by a skilled excavator operator in a log landing 
site  where  the  appellant  used  to  work.    The  appellant  was  a  skilled  excavator 
operator.    Found  with  the  body  was  a  considerable  quantity  of  builder's  lime, 
which was not a natural part of the soil at that place.   
 
The special leave point 
 
 
The appellant and  Marlow appealed to the  Court of Criminal Appeal of 
Tasmania.  The appeals were dismissed.  Both the appellant and Marlow applied 
to this Court for special leave to appeal.  Only the appellant succeeded, and only 
on one point:  whether a statement by the appellant to police officers on 4 March 
2000 (""the impugned statement"") was a ""confession or admission"" which should 
not have been received by the trial judge in view of its non-compliance with the 
requirement  of  video-taping  contained  in  s  8(2)(a)  of  the  Criminal  Law 
(Detention  and  Interrogation)  Act  1995  (Tas)  (""the  Act"").    The  impugned

""8. (1)  In this section – 

 

 

 

'confession or admission' means a confession or an admission – 

(a) 

that was made by an accused person who, at the time when 
the  confession  or  admission  was  made,  was  or  ought 
reasonably  to  have  been  suspected  by  a  police  officer  of 
having committed an offence; and 

(b) 

that was made in the course of official questioning;

'official  questioning'  means  questioning  by  a  police  officer  in 
connection with the investigation of the commission or the possible 
commission of an offence; 

'serious offence' means an indictable offence of such a nature that, 
if  a  person  of  or  over  the  age  of  18  years  is  charged  with  it,  the 
indictable  offence  cannot  be  dealt  with  summarily  without  the 
consent of the accused person and, in the case of a person under the 
age  of  18  years,  includes  any  indictable  offence  for  which  the 
person has been detained. 

(2)  On the trial of an accused person for a serious offence, evidence of 
any  confession  or  admission  by  the  accused  person  is  not  admissible 
unless –

(d) 

there  is  available  to  the  court  a  videotape  of  an  interview 
with  the  accused  person  in  the  course  of  which  the 
confession or admission was made; or 

if the prosecution proves on the balance of probabilities that 
there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  as  to  why  a  videotape 
referred  to  in  paragraph  (a)  could  not  be  made,  there  is 
available  to  the  court  a  videotape  of  an  interview  with  the 
accused  person  about  the  making  and  terms  of  the 
confession or admission or the substance of the confession 
or  admission  in  the  course  of  which  the  accused  person 
states that he or she made a confession or an admission in 
those  terms  or  confirms  the  substance  of  the  admission  or 
confession; or 

the  prosecution  proves  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that 
there was a reasonable explanation as to why the videotape 
referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) could not be made; or 

the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances 
which, in the interests of justice, justify the admission of the 
evidence. 

For  the  purposes  of  subsection  (2),  'reasonable  explanation'

How did the impugned statement come to be made? 
 
On 22 November 1999 the appellant, who had already been interviewed 
 
more than once about the victim's death, was interviewed by Detective Sergeant 
Lopes, Detective Allen and Detective Pretyman about a robbery that took place 
in 1991.  The latter officer went away to look for the custody sergeant, and in her 
absence a discussion between Detective Sergeant Lopes, Detective Allen and the 
appellant took place.  Detective Sergeant Lopes said that Marlow was going to be 
charged with the murder of the victim and there was a chance that the appellant 
could be charged also.  They then discussed whether the appellant might receive 
an ""indemnity"" for cooperating with the police.  On Detective Pretyman's return, 
the appellant was charged with the 1991 robbery and remanded in custody. 
 
 
On 25 November 1999 Detective Sergeant Lopes and Detective Pretyman 
took the appellant into a police interview room in a city building in Hobart, but 
the appellant said he wanted to talk in the open air.  Those officers and Inspector 
Little then accompanied the appellant to the roof.  There the appellant admitted 
that he and Marlow, but not  Williams, were  involved in  murdering the victim, 
and raised the subject of an indemnity.  While Detective Sergeant Lopes and the 
appellant  waited  on  the  roof  for  the  appellant's  wife  to  arrive,  the  appellant 
requested an indemnity and bail.  Thereafter the appellant said he did not wish to 
take part in a video-recorded interview, but he did write out a statement in his 
own hand describing how he assisted Marlow by telling him how to get access to, 
and to use, the excavator.   
 
 
On 4 March 2000 the appellant was at liberty, having been granted bail on 
the robbery charge.  He was then arrested on a charge of murdering the victim 
and taken to Launceston, where a video-recorded interview took place.  Including 
breaks, it lasted from  5.57pm to 9.17pm.  In that interview Detective Sergeant 
Lopes  and  Detective  Pretyman  reminded  the  appellant  of  the  statement  he  had 
made on 25 November 1999.   
 
 
The appellant contended that he had made the statements only because of 
police threats that if the statements were not made the appellant would be denied 
bail and every effort would be made to ""stitch him up"" on a charge of murdering

the  victim,  because  he  felt  the  need  to  obtain  bail  so  that  he  could  protect  his 
family  from  a  criminal  named  Jarvis  and  because  of  pressure  placed  on  his 
family.    Detective  Sergeant  Lopes  denied  these  contentions.    After  much 
questioning on these subjects, and on various circumstantial connections between 
the appellant and the victim's death, the interview concluded as follows:   
 

""ML  And so you're saying you've got no involvement in it whatsoever? 

SK    No, no, I haven't got any involvement in it whatsoever. 

ML    But in a matter of approximately three and a half months ago you 

told me that you and Marlow were involved in it. 

SK    Yeah, and I told you why, you know why. 

ML    Well I, I don't know why you've told me that and now you're saying 

to me that you don't know anything about it. 

SK  You know why I've done it. 

ML  

Is there anything else you want to ask? 

AP  No. 

14 

ML  Are you happy about the way you've been treated today? 

SK  Yeah no complaints. 

ML  Right,  in  that  case  then  we'll  conclude  the  interview  and  it's 

approximately 9.17pm."" 

 
The  appellant  then  made  some  telephone  calls.    He  was  charged, 
fingerprinted  and  photographed.    It  was  then  proposed  that  he  be  taken  to  the 
Launceston General Hospital for the purpose of obtaining samples of blood and 
hair.  Just before the appellant and accompanying officers got into the car, the 
appellant  made  the  impugned  statement.    He  said,  according  to  Detective 
Sergeant Lopes and Detective Pretyman:   
 

""Sorry about the interview – no hard feelings, I was just playing the game.  
I suppose I shouldn't have said that, I suppose you will make notes of that 
as well."" 

The police officers did not respond to this statement.  They made no note of it.  
They also did  not attempt to return the appellant to the interview room with  a 
view to making a video-recording of the appellant repeating what he had said so 
as  to  attract  s  8(2)(b)  of  the  Act.    Detective  Sergeant  Lopes  thought  the
--------

appellant's statement was made thirty to forty minutes after the video-recording 
had  ceased  and  the  appellant  had  left  the  video  interview  room;  Detective 
Pretyman thought it took place nearly an hour after those events.  
 
The fate of the appellant's objection 
 
 
The  reception  of  the  appellant's  impugned  statement  was  objected  to  at 
trial.  The trial judge overruled the objection on the ground that the statement was 
not made in the course of official questioning.  In the course of his summing-up 
the trial judge warned the jury about the disadvantages which the accused faced, 
the potential unreliability of the evidence, and the need to scrutinise the evidence 
of the statement with care.   
 
 
On appeal no complaint was made about these directions of the trial judge.  
The  sole  complaint  on  appeal  was  that  the  statement  should  not  have  been 
admitted.   
 
 
A majority (Underwood J, Evans J concurring) of the Court of Criminal 
Appeal  agreed  with  the  trial  judge's  reasoning.    Underwood  J  found  that  the 
impugned statement was not made in the course of official questioning, because 
all questioning had ceased by the time the appellant had left the video interview 
room.  His Honour said3:   
 

""The  plain  fact  in  this  case  is  that  the  impugned  admission  was 
volunteered  by  the  appellant  …  and  was  not  made  in  the  course  of  any 
questioning at all.  The questioning had clearly come to an end at the time 
the appellant … left the video interview room and set off for the charge 
room.    The  evidence  was  that  no  other  question  was  asked  of  him  by 
Detective Lopes or Detective Pretyman thereafter.  It would be straining 
the  language  of  the  legislature  to  hold  that  …  the  course  of  official 
questioning  was  still  in  progress  when  the  impugned  admission  was 
made."" 

 
Slicer  J,  on  the  other  hand,  construed  s  8  of  the  Act  as  conferring  a 
protection  which  was  ""temporal,  encompassing  events  (including  statements 
against interest) occurring whilst a person is in custody4"".  He therefore disagreed 
with the majority, but he joined in the order dismissing the appeal on the ground 
that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred:  Criminal Code 
(Tas), s 402(2).

7. 

The one material issue in this case was whether the impugned statement 

 
 
Immaterial issues 
 
 
was ""made in the course of official questioning"".   
 
 
No attempt was made to contend in this Court or the courts below that any 
of  the  possibly  applicable  exceptions  referred  to  in  ss  8(2)(b)-(d)  of  the  Act 
applied; hence it is not necessary to consider them, save to the extent that they 
may  throw  light  on  what  the  expression  ""made  in  the  course  of  official 
questioning"" means.   
 
 
One other potential controversy may be excluded from consideration.  The 
trial  judge  had  entertained  doubt  whether  the  impugned  statement  was  a 
""confession or admission"", on the ground that it was not an admission of guilt, 
but only an admission of making false allegations against the police in the video-
recorded interview.  In the course of argument in this Court a question was raised 
as to whether that doubt was soundly based.  There is a debate as to whether the 
expression ""confession or admission"" includes, in addition to statements which 
are apparently intended to be inculpatory, those which are apparently intended to 
be exculpatory5.  The point is important not only in various legislative contexts, 
but also in relation to the common law voluntariness rules6.  If it is possible that 
an exculpatory statement can be characterised as an admission, it is also possible 
that the impugned statement, which is not in terms inculpatory but which casts 
doubt on the exculpatory explanations offered during the video-recorded part of 
the interview of 4 March 2000 to account for the making of the confession of 25 
November 1999, can also be characterised as an admission.  Since this important 
point was not argued in the Court of Criminal Appeal or in this Court however, 
and since the appeal fails on other grounds, it is undesirable to decide it one way 
or the other. 
 

                                                                                                                                     
5   The view that it is is supported by such cases as R v Raso (1993) 115 FLR 319 at 
346 per Ormiston J and R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 at 437 per Wood CJ at 
CL (Sully and Ireland JJ concurring); support for the contrary view can be found in 
such  cases  as  R  v  Arnol  (1997)  6  Tas  R  374  at  382  per  Zeeman  J  and  R  v  GH 
(2000) 105 FCR 419 at 422-425 [14]-[22] per Spender J.

The problem of confessions to the police 
 
 
Though for many years before the 1960s legal rules had been developed in 
some detail to regulate the proof of confessions to police officers, from the 1960s 
on  concern  about  that  topic  increased.    The  key  questions,  from  case  to  case, 
were whether a confession was made; if so, in what terms; whether it was to be 
excluded as involuntary; whether it was to be excluded in the court's discretion 
either as having been obtained unfairly, or as having been obtained illegally or 
improperly; and whether it was reliable.  All these issues were capable of being 
affected  by  the  means  by  which  the  confession  was  perceived,  recorded  or 
recollected, and then transmitted to the court.   
 
 
in Driscoll v The Queen, Gibbs J said7: 
 

Particular concern was directed to allegedly fabricated confessions.  Thus 

""It is very common for an accused person to deny that he made an oral 
confession which police witnesses swear that he made.  The accused has 
an obvious motive to claim that police testimony of this kind is false.  On 
the other hand it would be unreal to imagine that every police officer in 
every case is too  scrupulous to succumb to  the temptation to  attempt to 
secure the conviction of a person whom he believes to be guilty by saying 
that he has confessed to the crime with which he is charged when in fact 
he has not done so."" 

Disputes could arise in circumstances including the following: 

But the problem went well beyond possible fabrication. 
 
 
 
(a)  where an oral confession was not noted down; 
 
(b)  where  an  oral  confession  was  noted  down,  whether  contemporaneously 
(for example, by a police typist laboriously recording each question and 
answer) or otherwise, and whether by a single police officer, or by two or 
more police officers acting separately or collaboratively; 

 
(c)  where  an  oral  confession  was  reduced  to  writing  but  not  signed  by  its 

maker; 

 
(d)  where an oral confession was reduced to writing by police officers before 

being signed by its maker; and

(e)  where a confession was written out by its maker. 
 
 
The disputes could turn on questions not only of fabrication, but also of 
misunderstanding,  misrecollection,  coercion,  or  oppression  in  a  broad  sense.  
Considerable amounts of court time were taken up, generally in the absence of 
the jury, in resolving disputes about confessions.  Considerable amounts of police 
time,  too,  were  taken  up  in  interviews  slowly  recorded  by  officers  operating 
typewriters  or  writing  in  notebooks.    Grave  allegations  were  commonly  made 
suggesting  police  perjury,  brutality  and  pressure.    Unfounded  though  many  of 
these allegations may have been, they were damaging to public confidence in the 
criminal  justice  system.    Over  time  the  courts,  law  reform  agencies  and 
legislatures  began  to  respond  to  this  state  of  affairs.    In  particular,  as  audio 
recording  became  more  common  in  commercial  and  social  life,  and  as  the 
necessary  equipment  became  more  efficient,  easier  to  operate,  and  cheaper,  it 
was  increasingly  suggested  that,  either  as  a  matter  of  sensible  practice  or  as  a 
precondition to admissibility, police interviews in criminal investigations should 
be  electronically  recorded.    Pilot  studies  were  conducted  which  suggested  the 
utility of this technique.  It was hoped that the introduction of a reliable means of 
recording  confessions  would  not  only  save  police  and  court  time  directly,  and 
reduce  the  need  for  police  officers  to  spend  long  periods  at  court,  but  also 
encourage more, and earlier, pleas of guilty.  All this would save public money as 
well  as  improving  the  integrity  of  the  trial  process  and  the  efficiency  of  the 
police.   
 
 
There were suggestions of this kind by members of this Court.  Thus in a 
case in which the police said that they had recorded a confession in a document 
composed  by  typing  out  their  questions  and  the  accused's  answers,  and  the 
accused had refused to sign it, Murphy J observed8: 
 

""The  liberty  of  the  accused,  the  reputation  of  the  police  and  the 
proper  administration  of  justice  are  jeopardised  by  the  failure,  where 
opportunity  permits,  to  provide  a  more  independent  record  of  police 
questioning."" 

In Driscoll v The Queen, another case involving an unsigned record of interview, 
Gibbs J (Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ concurring) said9:

""If the police wish to have supporting evidence of an interrogation there 
are other methods, such as tape recording, or the use of video-tape, which 
would  be  likely  to  be  more  effective  than  the  production  of  unsigned 
records of interview, and would not be open to the same objection."" 

27 

 
This  Court  decided  that  the  following  matters  were  relevant  to  the 
question of whether alleged admissions were in fact made:  attempts by police 
officers to prevent a solicitor getting in touch with a client held for questioning, 
refusals  by  them  to  allow  a  solicitor  to  be  present  during  questioning,  and  a 
failure to serve a copy of a record of interview on an accused person as soon as 
practicable after it was made (because it gives rise to a suspicion that the record 
may  have  been  altered)10.    These  matters  were  also  relevant  to  a  discretion  to 
exclude the evidence on grounds of unfairness11.  A written record of interview 
was held to be admissible if in the accused's handwriting or acknowledged by the 
accused in the presence of some impartial person12 or if otherwise adopted by the 
accused13 though there was a discretion to exclude it on grounds of unfairness14.  
Where a written record of interview was neither signed nor otherwise adopted, it 
was held to be not itself admissible, though the officers who prepared it might 
refresh  their  memory  from  it15.    More  recently,  in  McKinney  v  The  Queen16  a 
majority  of  this  Court  held  that  the  jury  should  be  instructed  to  give  careful 
consideration  to  the  dangers  involved  in  convicting  an  accused  person  in 
circumstances  where  the  only  (or  substantially  the  only)  basis  for  finding  that

guilt  has  been  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt  is  a  confession  allegedly 
made in police custody, unless its making has been reliably corroborated17.  This 
conclusion  was  reached  after  the  practice  of  recording  police  interviews  had 
begun  to  grow,  and  an  audiovisual  recording  was  seen  as  one  type  of  reliable 
corroboration18.   
 
 
Simultaneously  with  the  judicial  development  of  these  principles,  law 
reform agencies and commissions of inquiry began responding to the problem.  
Thus in 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended19: 
 

""Interviews should preferably be (a) recorded by mechanical means or (b) 
corroborated by a third person and, if these measures are not practicable in 
the  circumstances,  (c)  checked  by  a  third  person  after  being  reduced  to 
writing, or at least (d) reduced to writing and signed by the accused."" 

Both in the United Kingdom and Australia, numerous other bodies recommended 
that  the  admissibility  of  confessions  to  police  should,  in  general,  depend  on 
whether they had been tape-recorded20. 
 
 
As a result, it came to be viewed as a commonplace, not only in circles 
favourable to defence interests but also in police circles, that, despite its financial 
cost, the electronic recording of police interviews, particularly video-recording, 
would  generate  real  advantages.    It  would  be  useful  in  providing  a  means  of 
establishing exactly what was said; in proving that requirements for cautioning

and  other  formalities  had  been  complied  with;  in  narrowing  the  time  within 
which it could be alleged that threats had been made; in helping to estimate the 
fairness  and  propriety  of  the  questioning;  and  in  helping  to  evaluate,  by 
assessment of the demeanour and manner of the interviewee in responding, the 
reliability of what was said.   
 
The variety of available approaches 
 
 
The  debates  on  the  problem,  and  the  legislative  responses  to  them, 
revealed  a  variety  of  possible  solutions.    Leaving  aside  issues  about  whether 
confessions of all, or only some, crimes should be recorded, and which particular 
exceptions to any general prohibition of non-recorded confessions should exist, 
the following are among the possibilities which arose. 
 
Universal  exclusion:    not  adopted.    One  approach  would  have  been  to 
 
require that no confession to a police officer be admitted unless video-recorded – 
whether  or  not  the  maker  was  in  custody;  whether  or  not  the  maker  was 
suspected, or ought reasonably to have been suspected, of committing the crime 
confessed; and whether or not the maker had been asked any question by a police 
officer.  This approach has attracted no significant support, and it has not been 
followed by any Australian legislature21. 
 
Exclusion  of  confessions  by  persons  who  were  or  ought  to  have  been 
 
suspected:    Victoria.    A  second  and  more  limited  approach  requires  that  no 
confession  to  a  police  officer  made  by  a  person  who  was  suspected  or  ought 
reasonably  to  have  been  suspected  of  having  committed  an  offence  should  be 
admissible  unless  video-recorded.    On  this  approach,  it  is  necessary  to  video-
record confessions made without stimulation by the police or without warning to 
the police22. 
                                                                                                                                     
21   If  s  8(2)  of  the  Act  were  read  by  itself  and  ""confession  or  admission""  were  not 
defined in s 8(1) in the way it is, the Tasmanian legislation would have adopted this 
approach.  But the definition of ""confession or admission"" imposes two significant 
limits:    the  requirement  for  suspicion  on  the  part  of  a  police  officer,  and  the 
requirement  that  the  confession  or  admission  be  made  in  the  course  of  official 
questioning.   

22   This was the recommendation of the Coldrey Committee:  Victoria, Consultative 
Committee on Police Powers of Investigation, Custody and Investigation:  Report 
on  Section  460  of  the  Crimes  Act  1958,  (1986)  at  89  [6.22].  It  has  operated  in 
Victoria  since  1988:    Crimes  Act  1958  (Vic),  s  464H,  introduced  by  the  Crimes 
(Custody and Investigation) Act 1988 (Vic).

Exclusion  of  confessions  by  persons  suspected  on  reasonable  grounds:  
 
Western  Australia  and  Northern  Territory.    A  third  approach  requires  that  no 
confession to a police officer made by a person who is suspected on reasonable 
grounds of having committed an offence be admissible unless it is video-taped23.  
On  this  approach  too,  it  does  not  matter  whether  or  not  the  police  officer 
triggered  the  confession  by  a  question  –  for  though  a  non-video-recorded 
confession  could  be  admitted  if  there  were  a  ""reasonable  excuse""  for  its  not 
having  been  video-recorded  and  three  of  the  four  instances  of  a  reasonable 
excuse  referred  to  an  ""interview"",  nothing  in  the  legislation  required  that  the 
confession be an explicit response to particular questions. 
 
Exclusion  of  confessions  by  persons  who  were  or  ought  reasonably  to 
 
have  been  suspects  in  the  course  of  police  questioning  or  interviewing:    New 
South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia.  A fourth approach requires that no 
confession made by a person who is, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected 
by a police officer of having committed an offence is admissible if made in the 
course of official questioning or interviewing unless it is video-recorded24.   
 
Exclusion of confessions made during questioning of persons in custody:  
 
Queensland 1997-2000.  A fifth approach requires that no confession made to a 
                                                                                                                                     
23   This was introduced in Western Australia in 1992: Criminal Code (WA), s 570D, 
introduced  by  the  Acts  Amendment  (Jurisdiction  and  Criminal  Procedure)  Act 
1992  (WA),  s  5,  not  materially  amended  by  the  Criminal  Code  Amendment  Act 
1999  (WA),  s  5.    It  has  operated  in  the  Northern  Territory  since  1992:  Police 
Administration Act (NT), ss 142 and 143, introduced by the Police Administration 
Amendment Act (No 2) (NT), s 7.  (The legislation in its primary operation rendered 
inadmissible both confessions made before the commencement of questioning and 
confessions made during questioning.) 

24   This  approach  was  adopted  in  1995  in  New  South  Wales,  Tasmania  and  South 
Australia.  In New South Wales it first appeared in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW),  
s 424A introduced by the Evidence (Consequential and Other Provisions) Act 1995 
(NSW) Sched 1 [3].  In 1999, s 424A was transferred from the Crimes Act to the 
Criminal  Procedure  Act  1986  (NSW)  as  s  108:    Crimes  Legislation  Amendment 
(Sentencing)  Act  1999  (NSW)  Sched  2  [31]  and  Sched  3  [15].    In  2001  it  was 
renumbered as s 281:  Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) 
Act 2001 (NSW) Sched 1 [102].  In Tasmania this approach was embodied in s 8 of 
the Act.   In South Australia it appears in the Summary Offences Act 1953 (SA),  
s 74D (the expression ""in the course of official questioning"" is not used:  the duty is 
cast on an investigating officer ""who proposes to interview"" a suspect).

police officer during the questioning of a person in custody be admitted unless 
video-recorded25.  
 
Exclusion of confessions to a police officer by a person being questioned 
 
as  a  suspect:    Commonwealth,  Australian  Capital  Territory  and  Queensland 
since 2000.  A sixth approach requires that no confession made to a police officer 
by  a  person  being  questioned  as  a  suspect  (whether  under  arrest  or  not)  be 
admissible unless video-recorded26.  The relevant legislation applies only where 
the maker of the confession is in the company of a police officer for the purpose 
of being questioned as a suspect.  There is no provision relating to the case where 
the maker of the confession ought reasonably to have been suspected.   
 
 
Few now doubt the advantages of the widespread police practice of video-
recording  confessions,  and  few  now  criticise  the  various  types  of  legislation 
which  underpin  that  practice.    But  neither  the  advantages  of  the  legislation 
viewed generically, nor the varieties of the legislation viewed species by species, 
cast  specific  light  on  the  construction  of  particular  parts  of  it.    It  is  of  some 
interest, however, to compare s 8 of the Act with the legislation enacted around 
or  before  the  time  of  its  enactment.    Section  8  of  the  Act  did  not  adopt  the 
techniques used, different as they are in other respects, in Victoria since 1991, 
Western Australia since 1992 and the Northern Territory since 1992, of imposing 
a duty to video-record independently of the existence of police questioning.  It 
did adopt the expression ""in the course of official questioning"" used in the New 
South Wales legislation enacted in the same year, which may owe its origin to 
the reference to ""being questioned as a suspect"" in the Commonwealth legislation 
introduced in 1991:  Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 23V(1).     

                                                                                                                                     
25   This  was  the  approach  adopted  in  Queensland  in  the  period  1997-2000:    Police 

Powers and Responsibilities Act 1997 (Q), s 104. 

26   This is the approach adopted by the Commonwealth since 1991:  Crimes Act 1914 
(Cth), s 23V, introduced by the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) 
Amendment Act 1991 (Cth), s 3; amended, but not materially, in 2000:  Crimes at 
Sea Act 2000 (Cth) Sched 2, cll 1-2.  A similar provision prevails to some extent in 
the ACT:  Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 23A(6) (indictable offences); Crimes Act 1900 
(ACT), s 187 (summary offences).  It was also the position recommended by the 
Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland, Report on a Review of Police Powers 
in  Queensland,  vol  4,  Suspects'  Rights,  Police  Questioning  and  Pre-Charge 
Detention (1994) at 738-740, and now adopted in Queensland: Police Powers and 
Responsibilities Act 2000 (Q), ss 246 and 263-266.

Explanatory materials 
 
 
The Second Reading Speech of the Minister for Justice in support of the 
Bill which became the Act was delivered on 4 May 1995.  The Minister referred 
to Report No 64 of 1990 of the Law Reform Commissioner of Tasmania, entitled 
Police Powers of Interrogation and Detention (""the Report"").  He said that the 
Law Reform Commissioner27: 
 

""recommended that legislation be introduced to ensure that a police officer 
who has arrested any person, or has custody of an arrested person, either 
release the person or present him/her before a court within a reasonable 
time. 
  In  addition,  the  [C]ommissioner  recommended  that  police 
confessional evidence must be by way of electronic recording unless the 
prosecutor  can  prove  there  was  a  reasonable  excuse  as  to  why  an 
electronic  recording  was  not  made.    The  Government  has  accepted  the 
Law Reform Commissioner's recommendations."" 

 
The Minister may have had some other source for s 8 of the Act in mind, 
since  there  is  very  little  in  the  Report  about  electronic  recording,  and  no 
recommendations.   The Report  deals almost  entirely with questions about how 
long police officers may detain suspected persons in custody.  It did contend that 
""legislation  is  required  to  proclaim  the  rights  of  arrestees,  to  define  so  far  as 
possible the powers of the police, to supplement that definition by illustration and 
to provide sanctions""28.  Although the Report did state that the legislation should 
""impose  some  recording  duty  on  police  officers  to  enable  their  actions  and 
reasons  to  be  scrutinized  at  a  subsequent  time""29,  nothing  was  said  about 
electronic recording in its statement of recommendations.  Recommendation 2(d) 
was  that  any  officer  having  custody  of  an  arrested  person  at  a  police  station 
should,  contemporaneously  with  the  facts  recorded,  record  various  times, 
including  the  times  when  questioning  commenced  and  ended,  in  a  ""custody 
book""30. 
  In  Appendix  B  the  Report  summarised  various  statutes  and 
recommendations since 198631, noting that in March 1989 the Gibbs Committee

recommended  ""the  tape-recording  (on  audio-tape  or  video-tape)  of  cautioning, 
confessions and admissions"", and that the court have power to admit evidence of 
a  confession  or  admission  which  was  not  tape-recorded  if  this  would  not  be 
contrary  to  the  interests  of  justice32.    Appendix  B  also  referred  to  the 
recommendations  of  the  Coldrey  Committee33  in  1986,  which  were  adopted  in 
1988 in the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).  It noted that s 464G of that Act ""imposes a 
duty  on  an  investigating  official  to  record  (on  audio-tape  or  video-tape)  the 
caution, the advice of the suspect's rights, and the suspect's responses, if any"".  It 
also noted that34: 
 

""Section  464H  makes  admissible  any  evidence  obtained  by  an 
investigating official which is in the nature of a confession or admission 
(or  a  confirmation  thereof)  which  is  made  by  a  suspect  who  is  charged 
with an indictable offence, as long as that evidence has been recorded on 
audio-tape or video-tape.  Evidence which has not been so recorded may 
be  admissible  if  the  person  seeking  to  adduce  the  evidence  satisfies  the 
Court  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  circumstances  are 
exceptional and would justify the reception of the evidence."" 

40 

 
The  Minister  argued  before  the  House  of  Assembly  that  the  Bill 
represented  a  compromise.    On  the  one  hand,  the  Minister  pointed  to  the 
contention  in  the  Report  that  some  members  of  this  Court  in  Williams  v  The 
Queen had unduly hampered the investigative powers of the police by saying that 
it was35: 
 

""unlawful for a police officer having the custody of an arrested person to 
delay  taking  him  before  a  justice  in  order  to  provide  an  opportunity  to 
investigate  that  person's  complicity  in  a  criminal  offence,  whether  the 
offence under investigation is the offence for which the person has been 
arrested or another offence.""

The  Minister  said  that  this  would  be  remedied  by  cl  4(2)  of  the  Bill,  which 
enabled36: 
 

""every  person  who  has  been  taken  into  custody,  that  is,  who  is  under 
lawful arrest, to be detained by a police officer for a reasonable time after 
being  taken  into  custody  for  the  purposes  of  questioning  the  person,  or 
carrying  out  investigations  in  which  the  person  participates,  in  order  to 
determine his or her involvement, if any, in relation to an offence."" 

41 

42 

On  the  other  hand,  the  Minister  saw  it  as  necessary  that  there  be  ""appropriate 
safeguards in response to the liberalisation of police powers""37.  He then gave a 
lengthy description of the benefits of tape-recorded interviews, and summarised  
s 8 of the Act.  But his speech cast no specific light on the meaning of the words 
""in the course of official questioning"".  
 
The appellant's submissions 
 
 
The  appellant  submitted  that  s  8(1)(b)  should  be  construed  so  as  to 
promote the purpose or object of the Act.  That submission may be accepted.  But 
it raises two questions.  First, what is the purpose or object of the Act?  Secondly, 
what is the construction which promotes that purpose or object?   
 
 
As to the first question, the appellant submitted that the purpose or object 
was  to  overcome  ""perceived  problems  with  the  so-called  police  'verbal'  which 
was  dealt  with  by  the  High  Court38  in  McKinney's  case""39.    The  appellant 
described  these  ""perceived  problems""  as  including  the  possibility  of  police 
fabrication and the ease with which experienced police officers can effectuate it, 
the frequent lack of reliable corroboration of the making of the statement, and the 
practical burden on an accused person seeking to create a reasonable doubt about

the  police  evidence40.    The  appellant  submitted  that  those  problems  were 
experienced by him in view of the circumstances in which the appellant found 
himself  at  the  time  when  the  police  officers  said  he  made  the  impugned 
statement.  The Crown submitted, on the other hand, that the perceived problems 
were  somewhat  narrower  –  that  the  real  vice  of  criminal  trials  was  not  the 
attribution to the accused of brief admissions made at the scene of the crime or 
on arrest or while being driven to a police station, but the tender of elaborate and 
lengthy  typed  records  of  interview  which  were  not  signed  and  the  making  of 
which  was  not  corroborated.    That  submission  is  to  be  rejected,  and  the 
appellant's  submission  is  to  be  preferred:    the  problems  perceived  by  both  the 
courts and other observers included imperfections in both kinds of admission.   
 
 
However, though it may be accepted that the purpose or object of s 8 of 
the  Act  was  to  overcome  the  ""perceived  problems""  identified  in  many  earlier 
cases,  as  the  range  of  legislative  responses  shows,  those  problems  can  be 
overcome  in  different  ways  and  to  different  degrees.    The  ""purpose  or  object"" 
identified  does  not  compel  any  particular  construction  of  the  quite  detailed 
language of s 8 of the Act.  What the correct construction is must depend on the 
particular words used. 
 
 
The  appellant  accepted  that  if  a  police  officer  arrived  at  the  scene  of  a 
crime  and  asked  what  had  happened,  and  a  person  there  present  at  once 
confessed, s 8 of the Act could not apply, because the person was not, and ought 
not  reasonably  to  have  been,  suspected.    The  same  was  true  where  a  police 
officer picked up a telephone and a voice at the other end confessed to a crime.  
The  appellant  thus  accepted  that  the  point  before  which  video-recording  was 
unnecessary was the period leading up to the time when the police decided, or 
ought reasonably to have decided, that the maker of the statement was a suspect.  
But the appellant submitted that after that point, ""questioning"" extended beyond 
the  posing  of  interrogative  remarks.    Its  primary  meaning  included  any  words 
spoken between a person who is in custody and who is, or ought reasonably to 
have been, suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence, and a 
police  officer  investigating  an  offence41.    The  appellant  submitted,  in  the 
alternative,  that  if  that  meaning  were  too  broad,  a  narrower  meaning  was 
available  by  adding  two  qualifications:    that  the  words  be  ""spoken  within  a 
reasonable period following the conclusion of a period of formal questioning of 
the suspect by police"", and that the words ""seek to touch upon or to qualify or 
                                                                                                                                     
40   McKinney v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 474-476. 

41   The  appellant  thus  adopted  the  approach  of  Slicer  J  in  the  Court  of  Criminal 

Appeal:  Marlow and Kelly (2001) 129 A Crim R 51 at 86 [148].

modify anything said by the suspect during that period of formal questioning"".  
Hence the narrower meaning applied in this case, where a statement was made 
close  to  the  time  of  the  video-recorded  questioning  and  where  that  statement 
arose out of it in the sense that it modified what had been said during it.  It was 
also submitted that ""in the course of"" official questioning meant ""arising out of"" 
or ""as a result of"" official questioning. 
 
The construction of ""in the course of official questioning"" 
 
 
A person may make admissions during a period in which police officers 
are conducting official questioning without those admissions being responsive to 
any particular question.  This can arise in two ways.  First, an answer proffered 
may  simply  be  quite  unresponsive  or  unrelated  to  the  particular  question.  
Secondly, deliberately or fortuitously, the persons asking the questions may fall 
silent, and the person who is with them may, whether because of a desire to fill 
the silence or for some other reason, confess.  The legislation does not in terms 
require that the statement be made ""in response to a question put"" as s 86 of the 
Evidence  Act  2001  (Tas)  does,  for  example.    That  language  is  significant, 
because  it  appears  in  s  86  of  the  Evidence  Act  1995  (Cth)  and  s  86  of  the 
Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as well.  The language may be contrasted with the use 
of the expression ""in the course of official questioning"" in s 85(1)(a) of the three 
Acts.    ""Official  questioning""  is  defined  in  each  of  the  three  Acts  as  meaning 
""questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of 
the commission or possible commission of an offence""42.  That is in substance the 
same as the definition appearing in s 8(1) of the Act.  The contrast between the 
language of s 86 of the three Acts and the language of s 8 of the Act suggests that 
a  confession  which  is  entirely  non-responsive  to  any  question,  or  is  uttered 
during  a  pause  in  the  flow  of  the  questions  without  being  stimulated  by  any 
particular question, is one which falls within s 8 of the Act43.  The words ""in the 
course  of""  do  not  require  that  there  be  any  causal  connection  between  the 
admission  and  the  official  questioning.    Thus  ""a  monologue  in  response  to  a

43   Answers which are not ""in response to a question put"" could cover a wide range, 
from  answers  by  highly  intelligent  persons  which  wholly  or  partly  deal  with  the 
question while containing some material which, though related to the subject of the 
question, was not sought by its terms, to answers bearing no rational relationship of 
any kind to a question.  The precise meaning of ""in response to a question put"" in  
s 86 must be left to cases in which deciding the question is crucial.

general  enquiry  about  what  happened""44  has  been  held  to  be  in  the  course  of 
official questioning for the purposes of s 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and 
an  answer  volunteered  by  the  person  being  questioned  is  in  the  course  of 
questioning even though it is not directly responsive to any question45. 
 
 
However,  that  does  not  help  the  appellant.    His  case  depends  on  the 
correctness  of  either  the  broad  or  the  narrow  constructions  he  has  propounded 
and there are various difficulties in each of them.   
 
 
First, the constructions are too restrictive.  To require ""custody"" is to take 
a  limiting  step  which  the  legislative  language  did  not  take.    Some  police 
questioning of suspects takes place even though the suspects are not in custody.  
To require that the suspect be in custody cannot be supported on any available 
approach to construction, whether purposive or otherwise.   
 
 
Secondly, a major difficulty with the appellant's narrower constructions is 
that they involve inserting ideas which have no foothold in the language of s 8 of 
the  Act.    Section  8  requires  that  the  confession  or  admission  be  made  ""in  the 
course of official questioning"" – not ""within a reasonable period following the 
conclusion of a period of formal questioning"", and not  ""as a result of"" official 
questioning.   
 
 
Thirdly, a major difficulty with the appellant's broader construction is that 
by  seeking  to  include  ""any  words""  spoken  between  the  suspect  and  the  police 
officer,  it  gives  no  weight  to  the  requirement  that  there  be  questioning.    The 
appellant's broader construction means that s 8 of the Act applies where a police 
officer says to a suspect – ""Let us go to the police station so that I can ask you 
some questions.  I do not propose to question you until we get there"" – and the 
suspect  then  volunteers  a  confession.    An  event  cannot  be  said  to  have  taken 
place ""in the course of official questioning"" if the official nominates a future time 
when that course of questioning will commence, and the event happens before 
that time.  The appellant's  broader construction also  means that s  8 of the Act 
applies where the police officer says that no further questions will be asked and 
that the suspect is free to go home, and some time later the suspect confesses.  
These consequences of the appellant's broader construction are inconsistent with 
the statutory language and indicate that that construction is fallacious.

Slicer  J  concluded  that  the  expression  ""in  the  course  of  official 
questioning""  encompassed  all  ""events  …  occurring  whilst  a  person  is  in 
custody""46.  He saw this as being the ""widest interpretation permitted""47.  He said 
that  his  construction  ""reconciled""  the  ""competing  considerations"",  though  he 
acknowledged that it  did so ""imperfectly""48.   He arrived at his construction  by 
drawing an ""analogy"" with English cases on the Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act 1984 (UK), Code C49.  The reasoning underlying the English cases has been 
put thus50: 
 

 
""If this interview was correctly admitted, the effect would be to set 
at nought the requirements of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 
and  the  code  in  regard  to  interviews.    One  of  the  main  purposes  of  the 
code is to eliminate the possibility of an interview being concocted or of a 
true  interview  being  falsely  alleged  to  have  been  concocted.    If  it  were 
permissible for an officer simply to assert that, after a properly conducted 
interview produced a nil return, the suspect confessed off the record and 
for that confession to be admitted, then the safeguards of the code could 
readily be bypassed."" 

 
However, the English cases do not offer a sound basis for the appellant's 
construction.    Parliament  could  have  chosen  to  adopt  a  wider  solution  to  the 
problem than that which appears in s 8 of the Act, but it is not open to the courts 
of this country to ignore or alter the meaning of s 8 in order to achieve what they 
might  think  is  a  better  solution  by  creating  safeguards  which  Parliament  itself 
chose not to create.  In numerous respects the legislature contemplated in s 8 that 
confessions  or  admissions  could  be  admitted  without  being  video-recorded  by 
reason of matters resting wholly or partly on the oral uncorroborated evidence of 
police  officers.    One  such  matter  is  whether  its  maker  was  suspected  or  ought 
reasonably to have been suspected:  s 8(1) of the Act.  Another group of matters 
is whether it  was  practicable not to video-tape the confession or admission, or 
whether equipment was unobtainable, or whether the  maker did not consent to 
being video-taped, or whether the equipment malfunctioned:  s 8(3) of the Act.

Another matter is whether there are exceptional circumstances: s 8(2)(d) of the 
Act.  And yet another relates to issues of when official questioning started and 
ended,  and  what  happened  outside  that  period.    To  identify  the  possibility  of 
uncorroborated  police  evidence  being  admitted  on  these  questions  is  not  to 
identify  absurd  loopholes  to  be  closed  at  any  cost  to  the  actual  language 
employed.  The legislature was attacking part of the problem of uncorroborated 
police evidence.  Minds can differ on whether it should have attacked more of the 
problem.  The question is:  what part did it in fact attack?  That question is not to 
be answered by presuming that all parts were attacked. 
 
 
The  expression  ""in  the  course  of  official  questioning""  in  s  8  of  the  Act 
marks out a period of time running from when questioning commenced to when 
it ceased.  It renders s 8(2)(a) of the Act relatively narrow in the sense that it does 
not provide that video-recording is a condition for admissibility of all confessions 
made by persons who are suspected or ought reasonably to have been suspected 
of  having  committed  a  crime:    video-recording  is  only  a  condition  for 
admissibility  of  those  made  ""in  the  course  of  official  questioning"".    It  renders  
s 8(2)(a) of the Act relatively broad in the sense that it does provide that video-
recording is a condition for admissibility of confessions made ""in the course of 
official questioning"", without any limitation turning on whether the maker of the 
confession  is  in  custody  or  under  arrest.    The  requirement  that  confessions  be 
video-recorded extends to confessions made anywhere so long as they are made 
""in the course of official questioning"" – whether in police stations, in police cars, 
at the scene of a crime, or during informal encounters.  The difficulty of video-
recording  confessions  in  particular  circumstances  is  met  by  ss  8(2)(b)-(d)  and 
(3)(a)-(d)  of  the  Act.    But  whether  the  expression  ""in  the  course  of  official 
questioning""  is  viewed  as  making  s  8(2)(a)  narrow  or  broad,  it  stipulates  a 
relatively clear criterion, suitable for application by police officers, whose usual 
procedures are formal and methodical.   
 
 
In this matter ""the course of official questioning"" ended when Detective 
Sergeant Lopes ceased to ask questions and said at 9.17pm:  ""[W]e'll conclude 
the interview"".  Other activities of the appellant not related to official questioning 
and  other  police  procedures  not  involving  questioning  then  took  place.    No 
further question was asked which triggered the impugned statement.  To treat the 
impugned  statement  as  having  been  made  in  the  course  of  official  questioning 
would be to ignore the statutory language.  The impugned statement in this case 
is in the same position as the statement made by the accused in R v Julin51 where, 
after questioning had ceased, the accused had been arrested and cautioned, and 
driven  half  a  kilometre  to  the  scene  of  the  crime  during  which  time  no

conversation  took  place  between  him  and  the  police  officer:    ""[t]he  official 
questioning of the accused concluded prior to the car trip when he was arrested 
and cautioned …"".   
 
 
The  Crown  submitted  that  the  use  of  the  word  ""interview""  in  ss  8(2)(a) 
and  (b)  and  (3)(b)-(d)  of  the  Act  was  significant,  and  that  that  word  was 
synonymous with ""the course of official questioning"".  There is authority against 
that submission52.  It is not necessary to reach a view on the Crown's submission 
in order to decide the  present appeal.  Either ""official questioning"" is identical 
with an ""interview"" with an accused person, or it is broader, because it cannot be 
narrower.    If  the  impugned  statement  was  not  made  ""in  the  course  of  official 
questioning"", it does not matter whether or not it was made in an interview.  For 
the reasons set out above, it was not made in the course of official questioning. 
 
The proviso 
 
 
Many arguments were devoted to the question whether, if the majority of 
the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  had  erred,  the  appeal  should  nonetheless  be 
dismissed  on  the  ground  that  no  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  actually 
occurred,  pursuant  to  s  402(2)  of  the  Criminal  Code  (Tas).    In  view  of  the 
conclusion arrived at above that the  majority  did not err, it is not necessary to 
discuss those arguments in detail, but it is appropriate to deal briefly with them as 
follows. 
 
 
The appellant drew attention to the fact that although Slicer J had joined in 
dismissing  the  appeal  by  reason  of  s  402(2),  the  Crown  had  not  relied  on  that 
provision in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That does not prevent reliance on it 
in this Court.   
 
 
The appellant contended that there had been a substantial miscarriage of 
justice  in  admitting  the  impugned  statement,  because  it  caused  him  to  lose  a 
chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted, since on the evidence, 
apart from the impugned statement, it could not be said that he would inevitably 
have been convicted.  That contention fails for the following reasons. 
 
 
At the trial the appellant argued that he was not involved in the murder of 
the victim, but did not advance any evidence as to who was.  Beyond his denial, 
and  beyond  seeking  to  explain  the  25  November  1999  confession  which  he 
admitted,  in  substance,  making  in  chief,  he  called  no  evidence  capable  of

negating  inferences  arising  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  from  the  following 
circumstances. 
 
 
On 23 November 1990 the victim's partner answered the telephone at their 
residence.  The caller, a male, asked to speak to the victim.  The victim spoke 
briefly on the telephone and the victim's partner heard him arranging to meet the 
caller.  When the call terminated, the victim told his partner that he had to meet 
""Ned"" at a K-Mart in Launceston.  The only person whom the victim's partner 
had  heard  him  referring  to  as  ""Ned""  in  the  previous  twelve  months  was  the 
appellant.  Neither the victim's partner, nor anyone else apart from the person or 
persons who killed him, ever saw the victim alive after he went to meet ""Ned"".   
 
 
Marlow disliked the victim because he had informed on him in relation to 
the  bungled  stealing  incident  in  1987.    The  appellant  had  a  strong  dislike  of 
informants.   
 
 
On  1  March  2000  the  victim's  body  was  found  in  a  hole  approximately 
four  metres  deep.    That  hole  could  only  have  been  dug  by  an  experienced 
excavator  driver.    The  hole  had  been  made  in  an  old  disused  log  landing  at 
Bellevue Tier in the Central Highlands of Tasmania behind a locked boom gate.  
The victim had been shot with a shotgun twice in the back and once in the head, 
at close range.  In November 1990 the appellant's father-in-law was operating the 
log landing.  Few people had access to the site.  The appellant had worked on the 
site until about one month before the victim disappeared.  He had access to the 
keys  to  the  boom  gate,  which  was  supposed  to  be  locked  at  all  times,  and  the 
keys to an excavator which was on the site and which never left the site.  The 
appellant was an experienced excavator driver. 
 
 
According to Paget, in 1990 he was present at a meeting with Williams, 
Marlow and the appellant at which it was decided that the appellant would meet 
the victim, who was a drug addict, and would lure him with drugs to the log site 
operated  by  the  appellant's  father-in-law;  that  Marlow  would  shoot  him  there 
with a sawn-off double barrel shotgun; that the appellant would dig a grave with 
the  excavator  on  the  site;  and  that  Williams  would  take  the  victim's  car  to  the 
airport.  He also said that later that night Marlow admitted shooting the victim, 
but said that  when the victim  was shot in the chest he was only  wounded and 
began screaming, and that Marlow then blew his head off.  He also said that the 
appellant told him later that he had buried the victim deep in a hole he had dug 
with an excavator.   
 
 
While the appellant attacked the credibility of Paget strongly in this Court, 
and not without reason, Paget had told various details of his story to the police 
before the victim's body was found.  These were:  that the victim was to be taken 
to a bush work area where the appellant had been working, that the weapon used

on the victim was a shotgun, that Marlow had told him there had been more than 
one shot, that Marlow had told him that he had blown the victim's head off, and 
that the appellant had admitted burying him deep in a hole he had dug with an 
excavator.  All these matters were confirmed in whole or in part by the discovery 
of  the  victim's  body,  and  were  matters  of  which  Paget  could  have  had  no 
knowledge unless he had been told about them by the murderers.   
 
The appellant knew the victim, Marlow, Paget and Williams.  The other 
 
workers who had access to the site where the victim's grave was found did not 
know the victim, Marlow or Paget. 
 
 
On 22 November 1999 the appellant expressed interest to police officers 
in  discussing  an  indemnity  from  prosecution  which  the  State  Government  had 
offered in order to obtain information about the victim's death.   
 
 
Though  Detective  Sergeant  Lopes  and  the  appellant  differed  on  the 
details, the appellant accepted in his evidence in chief that on 25 November 1999 
he had confessed to Detective Sergeant Lopes that he and Marlow were involved 
in killing the victim.  The appellant accepted in this Court that this concession 
was ""crucial and, in the absence of any explanation, probably fatal to his chances 
of acquittal.""  The same concession was made in the video-recorded interview of  
4 March 2000.  Each concession was coupled with explanations.  The credibility 
of  the  explanations  was  low.    They  were  advanced  at  different  stages,  and  the 
differences  between  some  of  them  verged  on  contradiction.    One  was  that 
Detective Sergeant Lopes threatened to ""stitch him up"" for the murder.  Another 
was that pressure was being placed on his family.  Another was that he wanted 
bail  so  as  to  protect  his  family  from  Jarvis,  a  violent  criminal  shortly  to  be 
released  from  gaol.    Another  was  that  the  appellant  saw  Detective  Sergeant 
Lopes as a corrupt officer, and was endeavouring to trap him by getting evidence 
of his corruption on tape.  As Slicer J said, the assertions of the appellant during 
the  video-recorded  interview,  in  these  and  other  respects,  were  ""contradictory, 
evasive and indicative of 'playing a game'""53.   
 
 
Finally, Garry Armstrong (""Armstrong"") gave evidence that while he was 
in  prison  he  heard  Marlow  say  in  the  presence  of  the  appellant  that  he  would 
murder  the  victim  for  his  role  in  the  botched  1987  stealing  incident  and  for 
informing about it, and would dump him in the Central Plateau.  He also gave 
evidence  that  Marlow  and  the  appellant  had  confessed  to  him  that  they  were 
responsible  for  the  victim's  death.    Armstrong's  credibility  was  attacked  at  the 
trial, but his evidence fitted closely with the circumstantial evidence and with the

25 November 1999 confession, and by the time he gave evidence he had left gaol 
and had little to gain from giving evidence.   
 
 
The  appellant  accepted  that  there  was  no  flaw  in  the  trial  judge's 
summing-up.  The appellant also accepted that the trial judge put the appellant's 
case very favourably in relation to matters such as the credibility of Paget and the 
need to look for corroboration of his testimony.  Indeed, the acquittal of Williams 
was probably due to the jury's having attended to that warning and having failed 
to identify any corroboration of the case against Williams. 
 
 
The  explanations  proffered  by  the  appellant  for  the  making  of  the  25 
November 1999 confession, when taken into account with all the other evidence, 
even  when  allowance  is  made  for  significant  difficulties  in  some  of  Paget's 
evidence,  were  not  capable  of  raising  a  reasonable  doubt.    Their  inherent 
deficiencies were such that the impugned statement did not cause them further 
damage.   
 
 
In all the circumstances the admission of the impugned statement can have 
made  no  difference  to  the  finding  of  guilt  on  the  part  of  the  appellant.    There 
were  numerous  coincidences  operating  against  the  appellant,  which  cannot  be 
explained  by  postulating  his  innocence  and  are  only  consistent  with  his  guilt 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 
 
  

The appeal is dismissed.

72  McHUGH J.   The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant's conviction for 
murder  should  be  set  aside  because  the  trial  judge  admitted  into  evidence  a 
""confession  or  admission""  by  the  appellant.    The  appellant  denied  making  the 
""confession or admission"".  However, he contends that in any event it was not 
admissible because it was not videotaped, as required by s 8(2) of the Criminal 
Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act 1995 (Tas) (""the Act"")54.   
 
 
In my opinion, evidence of the ""confession or admission"" by the appellant 
was not admissible.  Section 8(2) of the Act requires the judge at a criminal trial 
to  reject  evidence  that  a  person  made  a  confession  or  admission  to  a  police 
officer if two matters are proved.  The first is that the officer suspected, or ought 
reasonably  to  have  suspected,  that  the  person  had  committed  an  offence.    The 
second  is  that  the  person  made  the  confession  or  admission  in  the  course  of 
""questioning  by  a  police  officer  in  connection  with  the  investigation  of  the 
commission or the possible commission of an offence""55.  However, the section 
provides  four  broad  exceptions  to  this  general  rule.    The  first  is  where  the 
confession  or  admission  was  videotaped56. 
is  where  an 
acknowledgment of the confession or admission was videotaped57.  The third is 
where  ""the  prosecution  proves  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  there  was  a 
reasonable explanation as to why"" a videotape of the confession or admission and 
the acknowledgment of it could not be made58.  The fourth is where ""the court is 
satisfied  that  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which,  in  the  interests  of 
justice, justify the admission of the evidence.""59 
 
 
In the present case, police officers suspected that the appellant was a party 
to  the  murder  for  which  he  was  convicted.    The  alleged  ""confession  or 
admission""  was  made  in  connection  with  the  questioning  of  the  appellant  in 
connection  with  the  investigation  of  the  murder.    For  the  purpose  of  s 8,  a 
confession or admission so made is made ""in the course of official questioning"".  
No videotape of the confession or admission or any acknowledgment of it was 
made.  Neither at the trial nor in this Court did the prosecution contend that there 
was a reasonable explanation why a videotape of the confession or admission or 
an acknowledgment of it could not have been made.  In addition, the prosecution

the  evidence  of 

did not contend at the trial that the interests of justice justified the admission of 
evidence of the confession or admission.  In these circumstances, evidence of the 
confession or admission was not admissible at the appellant's trial. 
 
 
However,  the  case  against  the  appellant  was  so  overwhelming  that 
evidence of the confession or admission could not have affected the result of the 
trial.    The  jury  would  have  convicted  the  appellant  even  if  the  trial  judge  had 
rejected 
the  confession  or  admission.  
Consequently,  the  Crown  has  established  that  the  erroneous  admission  of  the 
""confession  or  admission""  has  not  resulted  in  any  miscarriage  of  justice.    The 
appeal should be dismissed. 
 
Statement of the case 
 
In the Supreme Court of Tasmania, a jury convicted the appellant, Shane 
 
Leslie  Kelly,  and  another  man  of  murdering  Tony George Tanner 
in 
November 1990.    The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  of  Tasmania  dismissed  their 
appeals against their convictions60.  Underwood J (Evans J agreeing) held that the 
confession  or  admission  of  Kelly  was  not  made  in  the  course  of  official 
questioning because, at the time, questioning of Kelly had ceased and the police 
had left the video interview room61.  Dissenting on this point, Slicer J held that 
the  statement  was  inadmissible  because  s 8  precluded  the  admission  of  any 
statement while a person was in custody  unless the case fell within one of the 
four exceptions specified in s 8(2) of the Act62.  However, Slicer J held that the 
Crown had proved that no miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of the 
wrongful  admission  of  evidence63.    Subsequently,  this  Court  granted  special 
leave to Kelly to appeal against his conviction on the ground that a statement that 
he made to police officers was a ""confession or admission"" that was inadmissible 
by reason of the provisions of s 8 of the Act. 
 
The material facts 
 
 
In November 1999,  two police officers took Kelly  to a police interview 
room in a city building in Hobart where he said he wanted to talk in the open air.  
When  taken  to  the  rooftop  area  of  the  building,  Kelly  admitted  that  he  and 
another man were involved in murdering Tanner.  Later, he wrote out a statement

in which he described how he had assisted the other man to obtain the keys to the 
excavator that was used to bury Tanner. 
 
 
However,  it  was  not  until  4  March  2000  that  Kelly  was  arrested  and 
charged  with  murdering  Tanner.    He  was  taken  to  Launceston  where  he  was 
interviewed by the same police officers.  The interview took over three hours and 
was  video-recorded.    In  the  interview,  Kelly  claimed  that  he  made  the  earlier 
incriminating statements only because of various threats that the police officers 
had made.  He denied ""any involvement in it whatsoever.""  The interview ended 
when one of the detectives, having been told by Kelly that he had no complaints 
about how he was being treated ""today"", said:

Kelly was then charged, fingerprinted and photographed.  Afterwards, he 
was taken by car to a hospital to obtain samples of his blood and hair.  According 
to  the  police  officers,  somewhere  between  30  minutes  and  an  hour  after  the 
video-recording had ceased, and just before Kelly got into the car, he said:  
 

""[S]orry about the interview, no hard feelings, I was just playing the game. 
... I suppose I shouldn't have said that, I suppose you will make notes of 
that as well."" 

The police officers made no attempt to take Kelly back to the interview 

 
room to confirm that he had made this statement. 
 
In the course of official questioning 
 
 
At the trial and in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Crown successfully 
argued  that  s 8  of  the  Act  did  not  preclude  the  admissibility  of  the  above 
statement concerning ""playing the game"" because it was not made in the course 
of official questioning, a pre-condition to the section's preclusion.  The Crown 
contended that the course of official questioning had ceased at 9.17pm when the 
recorded interview terminated.  In response, counsel for Kelly contended that the 
course of official questioning included anything said by a person in custody to a 
police officer investigating an offence and who suspects or ought reasonably to 
suspect that person of committing the offence.  Alternatively, counsel for Kelly 
contended  that  the  course  of  official  questioning  covered  any  words  spoken 
within a reasonable time after the conclusion of formal questioning by the police 
and which pertained to matters referred to in the formal questioning. 
 
 

At the time when Kelly was charged, s 8 of the Act provided:

age  of  18  years,  includes  any  indictable  offence  for  which  the 
person has been detained.

If the words ""made in the course of official questioning"" are read with a 
temporal connotation and in isolation, without regard to the policy or purpose of 
s 8(2),  the  official  questioning  in  this  case  ended  at  9.17pm  on  4 March  2000 
when the recorded interview ended.  The phrase ""in the course of"" ordinarily has 
a temporal and not a causal connotation64.  Its primary meaning suggests that the 
preclusion in s 8(2) is directed to confessions or admissions made during a period 
of  police  questioning  that,  although  commenced,  has  not  ended.    Further,  the 
logic  with  which  s 8  is  constructed  requires  that  the  definition  of  ""official 
questioning"" in s 8(1) be read into s 8(2).  If that is done, the apparent primary 
meaning  of  the  definition  when  applied  mechanically  in  s 8(2)  confines  the 
confessions  or  admissions  to  which  that  sub-section  applies  to  those  that  are 
made  during  a  period  of  police  questioning.    On  that  view,  any  confession  or 
admission  made  before  official  questioning  commences  or  after  it  ends  is 
admissible in evidence. 
 
 
However,  a  legislative  definition  is  not  or,  at  all  events,  should  not  be 
framed  as  a  substantive  enactment.    In  Gibb  v  Federal  Commissioner  of 
Taxation, Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Taylor JJ stated65: 
 

""The function of a definition clause in a statute is merely to indicate that 
when particular words or expressions the subject of definition, are found

in  the  substantive  part  of  the  statute  under  consideration,  they  are  to  be 
understood  in  the  defined  sense  –  or  are  to  be  taken  to  include  certain 
things  which,  but  for  the  definition,  they  would  not  include. 
... 
[Definition] clauses are ... no more than an aid to the construction of the 
statute and do not operate in any other way."" (emphasis added) 

In addition, as Dixon CJ once pointed out, ""the context, the general purpose and 
policy  of  a  provision  and  its  consistency  and  fairness  are  surer  guides  to  its 
meaning than the logic with which it is constructed.""66  At issue here is not the 
meaning  of  the  phrase  ""in  the  course  of  official  questioning""  when  read  in 
isolation.  The issue is the meaning of s 8(2) when read with the aid provided by 
the definitions of ""confession or admission"" and ""official questioning"" in s 8(1), 
by  the  evident  policy  of  s 8  and  by  the  mischief  that  it  sought  to  overcome.  
When  that  is  done,  s 8(2)  does  not  have  the  meaning  for  which  the  Crown 
contends and which the courts in Tasmania accepted.  Subject to four exceptions, 
s 8(2) has the purpose of preventing evidence being given at a criminal trial of 
any incriminating statement made to a police officer by a person after the officer: 
 
 

had  or  ought  to  have  suspected  that  the  person  had  committed  a 
crime; 

. 

 

. 

had  questioned  or  intimated  an  intention  to  question  that  person 
about the crime;  

and the statement was made in response to or was otherwise connected with any 
questioning or proposed questioning by the officer. 
 
 
 

The four exceptions are: 

(1) 

the statement was videotaped; or 

85 

(2) 

(3) 

an acknowledgment of the confession or admission was videotaped 
and  there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  for  the  omission  to 
videotape the statement when it was made; or 

there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  for  the  omission  to  videotape 
both the statement and an acknowledgment of it; or 

(4) 

the interests of justice justify the admission of the statement.

The mischief to which s 8 is directed 
 
 
The reliability of confessions – particularly those made to police officers – 
have  long  troubled  the  common  law  courts.    In  R v Thompson67,  Cave J 
commented that it was remarkable how rarely evidence of a confession was given 
 

""when the proof of the prisoner's guilt is otherwise clear and satisfactory; 
but, when it is not clear and satisfactory, the prisoner is not unfrequently 
alleged to have been seized with the desire born of penitence and remorse 
to supplement it with a confession; – a desire which vanishes as soon as he 
appears in a court of justice.""   

 
In 1912, the English judges of the King's Bench Division promulgated the 
Judges'  Rules  to  deal  with  concerns  about  the  voluntariness  and  reliability  of 
confessions or admissions made to police officers by a person who was suspected 
of having committed an offence.  Despite the adoption – expressly or by practice 
–  in  common  law  jurisdictions  of  the  Judges'  Rules  or  their  equivalents, 
throughout  the  20th  century  accused  persons  regularly  complained  that 
confessions that they had made or allegedly made had been obtained by physical 
force or unfair psychological pressure or had been invented.   
 
 
Cases concerning professional criminals created a special problem. Where 
the  accused  was  a  professional  criminal,  often  the  only  evidence  sufficient  to 
convict him or her was an alleged oral confession made to one or more police 
officers.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that, in many of these cases, no signed 
confession  could  be  obtained  from  the  accused,  despite  severe  physical  or 
psychological  pressure  being  placed  on  that  person.      In  these  circumstances, 
manufacturing  an  oral  confession  (the  so-called  ""verbal"")  was  an  effective  – 
often the only – means of convicting an accused person believed by unscrupulous 
police officers, often through reliable informants, to be guilty of an offence. 
 
 
In  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century,  another  form  of  confessional 
evidence became widespread: the unsigned typewritten record of interview where 
the accused allegedly confessed freely and in great detail to a police officer but 
refused to sign the typed record of the interview.  If the officer claimed that the 
accused  had  adopted  the  typewritten  document  recording  the  interview,  the 
document  was  admissible  as  evidence  against  the  accused68.  In  Driscoll  v  The 
Queen69, Gibbs J said:

""[I]f the accused has acknowledged or adopted the document as such – eg,

admissible. ... If part only of the document has been acknowledged, only 
that part is admissible.""

91 

The document was not admissible merely because, when read to the accused, he 
or  she  acknowledged  its  contents  as  true70.    The  accused  had  to  adopt  or 
acknowledge the document itself as correct before it was admissible in evidence. 
 
In Dawson v The Queen71, Dixon CJ had said of the document recording 
 
the  interview  in  that  case  that  it  was  admissible  because  the  accused 
acknowledged its correctness after reading it aloud.  Subsequently, in New South 
Wales – and no doubt in other States – it became a common practice for a police 
officer  to  allege  that,  although  the  accused  refused  to  sign  the  record  of 
interview,  he  or  she  had  acknowledged  the  accuracy  of  the  document  after 
reading it – in some cases aloud72.  Unsigned records of interview were a feature 
of, and the principal – sometimes the only – evidence, in many cases concerned 
with  ""heavy""  crimes,  such  as  gangland  killings,  armed  hold-ups,  safe-breaking 
and  drug-related  offences,  for  example,  where  the  accused  was  a  professional 
criminal. 
 
 
No  one  has  ever  satisfactorily  explained  what  psychological  mechanism 
would  induce  a  person,  particularly  a  hardened,  professional  criminal  –  often 
with years of experience of the criminal courts – to refuse to sign the record of 
interview after sitting on the other side of a desk for an hour or more slowly and 
freely confessing in great detail to the offence.  It may be true, as Lawton LJ once 
said73:

""It is a matter of human experience, which has long been recognised, that 
wrongdoers  who  are  about  to  be  revealed  for  what  they  are,  often  find 
relief from their inner tensions by talking about what they have done.  In 
our  judgment  and  experience  this  is  a  common  explanation  for  oral 
admissions made at or about the time of arrest and later retracted."" 

92 

However, this statement does not explain why the accused should refuse to sign 
the  record  of  interview  after  having  freely  confessed  to  police  officers  in  the 
knowledge  that  his  or  her  answers  to  questions  would  be  recorded  –  usually 
slowly – on a typewriter and would be used as evidence against him or her.  In 
any event, it is highly unlikely that hardened, professional criminals would seek 
relief by way of confession from inner tensions generated by the knowledge that 
they ""are about to be revealed for what they are"". 
 
 
There are good grounds for supposing that over the years many of these 
""records  of  interview""  tendered  in  evidence  have  been  fabricated74.    This  is  so 
even  though  an  objective  fact  or facts  often seemed  to  point  to  them  being  an 
accurate record of a real interview.  Frequently, the details of the offence were 
interwoven with or linked to some fact or facts, unconnected with the offence, 
that the accused admitted was true and which the police officer claimed had not 
been known to him until the accused confessed75.  Further, the answers seemed to 
catch the jargon, idiom and speech patterns of the accused76.  Sometimes, as the 
Wood  Royal  Commission  found77,  the  recorded  answers  did  not  directly 
inculpate  the  accused  but  were  cunningly  constructed  to  prejudice  the  jury 
against  that  person.    Many  records  of  interview,  if  they  were  fabricated,  were 
works of art, worthy of an award-winning scriptwriter.

15 ALR 305; Carr v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 314 and McKinney v The Queen 
(1991) 171 CLR 468 at 472 per Mason CJ, Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, where 
it was recognised that an unsigned police record of interview might be fabricated.  

75   For example, ""Q. Where did you learn about explosives?  A. Years ago, when I was 
working on road construction in New Guinea.""  This formed part of the allegedly 
fabricated statement in R v Fernon (1967) 85 WN (NSW) (Pt 1) 544. 

76   For example, ""Q. Police searched your home ... and found an arsenal of weapons ... 
A.  They  are  just  tools  of  trade  Mr  Morey,  protection  you  know.""  (Driscoll  v

The  dangers  of  admitting  unsigned  records  of  interview  into  evidence 
were convincingly pointed out by Gibbs J in this Court in Driscoll v The Queen.  
His Honour said78: 
 

""In  Reg  v  Ragen79,  McClemens  J  suggested  that  it  would  be  more 
satisfactory to put before the jury the contemporaneous record itself than 
to allow a witness to give oral evidence which he had probably learnt by 
heart after studying the record.  The answer to this suggestion is that as a 
general rule such a record, if unsigned, will add nothing to the weight of 
the testimony of the police officers who give oral evidence as to what was 
said  in  the  course  of  the  interrogation,  and  will  in  itself  be  of  little 
evidential value.  The fact that a police officer has sworn that the accused 
adopted  the  record  makes  it  legally  admissible,  but  it  is  for  the  jury  to 
decide whether they are satisfied that the accused did adopt it and if they 
are not so satisfied they may not use it in reaching their decision.  The fact 
that the record had been prepared would in most cases be of no assistance 
to the jury in deciding whether the accused person had adopted it.  The 
mere existence of a record is no safeguard against perjury.  If the police 
officers are prepared to give false testimony as to what the accused said, it 
may  be  expected  that  they  will  not  shrink  from  compiling  a  false 
document as well.  The danger is that a jury may erroneously regard the 
written  record  as  in  some  way  strengthening  or  corroborating  the  oral 
testimony.  Moreover the record, if admitted, will be taken into the jury 
room  when  the  jury  retire  to  consider  their  verdict,  and  by  its  very 
availability may have an influence upon their deliberations which is out of 
all proportion to its real weight.  For these reasons, it would appear to me 
that in all cases in which an unsigned record of interview is tendered the 
judge should give the most careful consideration to the question whether it

Notwithstanding  repeated  claims  by  accused  that  unsigned  records  of 
interview  had  been  invented,  for  a  long  period  –  at  least  until  the  1970s  –

officers would fabricate these unsigned records of interviews.  They appeared to 
find  it  even  more  difficult  to  accept  that  senior  police  officers  –  often  an 
inspector or higher rank – would falsely testify that, when called in at the end of 
the  interview,  the  accused  confirmed  that  he  had  said  what  was  recorded  but 
refused to sign the interview.  However, a series of Commissions and Inquiries in 
Australia81 and England82 established that ""the fabrication of evidence by police 
officers – particularly of confessional evidence – does occur""83.  Commissioner 
Fitzgerald84, for example, found that falsifying evidence was a routine feature of 
""police culture"".  He said85: 
 

""As part of that culture, many police are routinely involved in misconduct, 
in  rejecting  the  applicability  of  the  law  to  police,  in  improperly 
influencing the outcome of court proceedings, and in lying under oath as 
well as breaching their oath to enforce the law. ... Such verballing involves 
a rejection of fundamental standards.""

Subsequently,  other  Commissions  and  Committees  recommended  similar 
procedures87. 
 
The legislative response to the mischief 
 
 
Acting on the recommendations and findings of various Commissions and 
Inquiries,  all  Australian  legislatures  have  enacted  legislation88  that  seeks  to 
protect  the  rights  of  accused  persons  during  a  period  when  their  rights  are 
vulnerable by reason of the mistaken recollection or lies of police officers.  The 
enactments of the various legislatures are broadly similar in principle although 
they  differ  in  detail.    In  general,  they  identify  the  period  of  vulnerability  as 
commencing with the time when the facts raise a suspicion of the accused's guilt.  
In  most  jurisdictions,  the  period  is  thereafter  open-ended.    The  enactments 
recognise  that  miscarriages  of  justice  may  occur  when  there  is  no  mechanical 
record confirming an allegation by police officers that the accused has confessed 
to a crime or made a damaging admission after he or she was or ought reasonably 
to have been seen as a suspect.  The evident policy of the enactments is that it is 
against  the  interests  of  justice  to  admit  evidence  of  such  confessions  or 
admissions unless there is a mechanical record of such confession or admission 
or  an  acknowledgment  of  it,  or  in  some  jurisdictions  that  exceptional 
circumstances justify the admission of the evidence. 
 
 
Given the mischief to which the Australian legislatures have directed their 
attention  and  the  policy  behind  the  enactments,  it  would  not  be  defensible  to 
make the admissibility of confessions or admissions made during the period of 
vulnerability  turn  upon  fine  verbal  distinctions  between  the  legislation  of 
particular  jurisdictions.    Rather,  courts  construing  the  various  legislative 
enactments  should  construe  them  in  the  same  broad  way  that  Dixon J  in

Little v The  Commonwealth89  thought  that  protective  provisions,  such  as  time 
limitation provisions, should be construed.  As far as the statutory language will 
permit, the legislation of the various jurisdictions should be interpreted liberally 
and  uniformly  to  give  effect  to  what  is  a  national  policy  behind  this  class  of 
legislation.  To so construe the legislation of a particular jurisdiction in this way 
is not to reject the will of the legislature of that jurisdiction.  It is merely another 
application of the dictum of Dixon CJ that ""the context, the general purpose and 
policy  of  a  provision  and  its  consistency  and  fairness  are  surer  guides  to  its 
meaning than the logic with which it is constructed.""90  It also accords with the 
purposive theory of statutory construction. 
 
Purposive construction 
 
Purposive construction is the modern approach to statutory construction91.  
 
Legislative enactments should be construed so as to give effect to their purpose 
even if on occasions this may require a ""strained construction"" to be placed on 
the legislation92.  The literal meaning of the legislative text is the beginning, not 
the  end,  of  the  search  for  the  intention  of  the  legislature.    As  Learned  Hand J 
famously pointed out93: 
 

""Of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the 
primary,  and  ordinarily  the  most  reliable,  source  of  interpreting  the 
meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract, or anything else.  But it 
is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to 
make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always 
have  some  purpose  or  object  to  accomplish,  whose  sympathetic  and 
imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.""

  In  addition,

electronic  recording  was  not  made.    The  Government  has  accepted  the 
Law Reform Commissioner's recommendations.""95 

the  commissioner  recommended 

100 

101 

102 

 
The Report makes only the first recommendation.  It does not consider the 
second  recommendation.    Nevertheless,  the  Second  Reading  Speech  indicates 
that the purpose of s 8 of the Act is to exclude confessions made while a person 
is in custody and has not been brought before a court.  Such confessions would 
be admissible only if electronically recorded or there was a reasonable excuse for 
not so recording them.  
 
 
Read without the definitions in sub-s 8(1), sub-ss 8(2) and (3) indicate a 
policy of excluding as evidence all confessions unless they are videotaped or the 
interests of justice require their admission or there is a reasonable explanation for 
the failure to videotape the confession.  Moreover, a confession is not admissible 
even  if  it  is  proved  that  there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  for  the  failure  to 
videotape it.  To make the confession or admission admissible, the prosecution 
must  prove  that  there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  for  not  subsequently 
videotaping an acknowledgment of the confession or admission.  
 
 
However,  s 8(2)  must  be  read  with  the  definitions  of  ""confession  or 
admission"",  ""official  questioning""  and  ""serious  offence""  in  s 8(1).    Those 
definitions show that s 8(2) does not require the videotaping of all confessions or 
admissions, but only those made to police officers in respect of serious offences.  
This accords with the Minister's statement in the Second Reading Speech that it 
is directed at ""police confessional evidence"".  The need to limit s 8's preclusion to 
police confessional evidence also explains the use of the awkward phrase ""in the 
course  of  official  questioning"".    Although  the  phrase  is  a  pre-condition  to  the 
operation of s 8(2), given the mischief at which the section was aimed, it is better 
to treat the phrase as a concept rather than a precise criterion of legal rights and

duties.  The fact that the phrase is in a definition clause and that the section must 
be construed purposively provides further support for doing so. 
 
 
As  I  earlier  pointed  out,  the  function  of  a  definition  is  not  to  enact 
substantive law.  It is to provide aid in construing the statute.  Nothing is more 
likely to defeat the intention of the legislature than to give a definition a narrow, 
literal meaning and then use that meaning to negate the evident policy or purpose 
of a substantive enactment.  There is, of course, always a question whether the 
definition  is  expressly  or  impliedly  excluded.    But  once  it  is  clear  that  the 
definition  applies,  the  better  –  I  think  the  only  proper  –  course  is  to  read  the 
words  of  the  definition  into  the  substantive  enactment  and  then  construe  the 
substantive  enactment  –  in  its  extended  or  confined  sense  –  in  its  context  and 
bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome.  
To construe the definition before its text has been inserted into the fabric of the 
substantive  enactment  invites  error  as  to  the  meaning  of  the  substantive 
enactment.  In so far  as the judgment of Megarry J in No 20  Cannon St  Ltd v 
Singer & Friedlander Ltd96 suggests his Lordship thought that an interpretation 
or  definition  clause  should  be  construed  independently  of  the  substantive 
enactment, I think his Lordship erred.  The long title to the first Interpretation 
Act 1850 (UK) (13 & 14 Vict c 21) was ""An Act for shortening the Language 
used in Acts of Parliament"".  The long title to the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 
(Tas),  is  ""An  Act  to  provide  certain  rules  for  the  interpretation  of  Acts  of 
Parliament; to define certain terms commonly used therein; and to facilitate the 
shortening  of  their  phraseology"".    These  titles  convey  the  true  purpose  of  an 
interpretation  or  definition  clause.    It  shortens,  but  is  part  of,  the  text  of  the 
substantive enactment to which it applies.  
 
 
The mischief at which s 8 is aimed is clear:  the attack on the integrity of 
the  administration  of  justice  by  false  or  unreliable  confessions  or  admissions 
allegedly  made  by  suspects  during  a  police  investigation  of  a  serious  criminal 
offence.  It should be interpreted, so far as possible, to overcome that mischief.  
The  prohibition  in  the  section  may  not  be  confined  to  oral  confessions.  
Arguably, it includes written as well as oral confessions unless ""in the course of 
official  questioning""  impliedly  excludes  a  written  confession  or  admission.    In 
any event, however, the section's effect on the mischief that it was intended to 
overcome  would  be  seriously  undermined  if  ""in  the  course  of  official 
questioning"" were defined by the clock and the officer's testimony as to the times 
when questioning commenced and ended.  To construe s 8(2) in the way that the 
learned judges did in the Supreme Court of Tasmania is to undermine its purpose 
and to fail to deal effectively with the mischief at which it is aimed.  Such an 
interpretation  would  also  make  the  section's  operation  hostage  to  the  oral 
evidence of the police officers as to when the questioning commenced and ended.

When the definitions in s 8(1) are read into s 8(2), that sub-section shows 
that, subject to specified exceptions, evidence of a confession or admission is not 
admissible  if  it  was  made  in  the  course  of  questioning  by  a  police  officer  in 
connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of a 
serious  offence  in  circumstances  where  the  person  was  or  ought  reasonably  to 
have been suspected by a police officer of having committed an offence.  Given 
the purpose of the section and the mischief that it was designed to overcome, I 
see no difficulty in reading s 8(2), as defined, as applying to any confession or 
admission that is connected to questioning or proposed questioning by a police 
officer  in  connection  with  the  investigation  of  a  serious  offence.    Judicial 
expositions of the phrase ""in the course of"" show that, in particular contexts, it 
can have a meaning equivalent to ""in connection with"".  Thus, in In re Pryce; 
Ex parte  Rensburg97,  Bacon CJ  denied  that  the  expression  ""debts  due  to  the 
bankrupt in the course of his trade"" meant a debt incurred while engaged in his 
trade.  The Chief Justice said98 that the particular debt in that case had ""nothing 
whatever to do with the bankrupt's trade.""  The headnote of the report interpreted 
the  decision  as  meaning  that  the  statutory  expression  covered  ""only  debts 
connected with the trade"".  In re Pryce; Ex parte Rensburg99 was followed and 
applied by the Divisional Court (Cave and Wills JJ) in In re Jenkinson; Ex parte 
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Bank100.  Similarly in Davidson v M'Robb101, 
Lord Dunedin said: 
 

""'[I]n  the  course  of  employment'  is  a  different  thing  from  'during  the 
period  of  employment'.    It  connotes,  to  my  mind,  the  idea  that  the 
workman or servant is doing something which is part of his service to his 
employer or master."" (emphasis added) 

106 

 
Given the purpose of the section, there is no difficulty in construing the 
words ""confession or an admission ... made in the course of official questioning"" 
as  referring  to  a  confession  or  admission  made  in  connection  with  police 
questioning.    Nor  do  I  think  there  is  any  difficulty  in  holding  that  the  section 
applies to any confession or admission that is made in response to an intimation 
that the officer intends to question the suspect.  The legislature is not likely to 
have  intended  the  section's  preclusion  to  operate  only  on  confessions  or

admissions allegedly made after a police officer has asked a question connected 
with the investigation, however trivial it might be.  Of course, the confession or 
admission  must  be  related  to  police  questioning  in  connection  with  the 
investigation, but it will be so related if it is made in response to an indication 
that the suspect is to be questioned.  It borders on the absurd to think that s 8 does 
not  apply  to  a  confession  or  admission  made  immediately  after  the  officer  has 
said,  ""I  want  you  to  come  to  the  station  for  questioning"",  but  applies  to  a 
confession or admission made in answer to the officer's first question:  ""What can 
you tell me about the assault on X?""  To so hold would make ""a fortress out of 
the  dictionary"".    It  would  treat  the  term  ""questioning""  as  a  precise  criterion  of 
admissibility  rather  than  as  an  element  in  a  compound  conception  that  is 
concerned to limit the admissibility of ""police confessional evidence"". 
 
 
In the present case, the alleged admission – if it was an admission, and I 
doubt  that  it  was  –  was  directly  connected  to  the  extensive  questioning  by  the 
police officers that had occurred about an hour earlier.  The Crown did not argue 
that it was not an admission.  Because that is so, it was an ""admission"" to which 
s 8 applied.  The learned trial judge should have rejected evidence concerning it.  
 
 
However,  as  the  evidence  set  out  in  other  judgments  demonstrates,  the 
case against Kelly was so cogent that it is impossible to believe that the result of 
the trial was affected by the admission of the evidence concerning the ""playing 
the  game""  statement.    Accordingly,  the  Crown  has  established  that  no 
miscarriage of justice occurred in this case by reason of the wrongful admission 
of that evidence.

110  KIRBY  J.      The  point  upon  which  Mr Shane  Kelly  (""the  appellant"")  obtained 
special leave to appeal to this Court was the admissibility of an oral statement 
attributed to him by police witnesses.   
 
 
At trial, the appellant denied making the statement.  It was allegedly made 
within less than an hour of the conclusion of lengthy questioning of the appellant 
by  police,  recorded  on  video  film.    For  the  appellant,  the  impugned  statement 
was precisely the kind of ""police verbal"" that had led to the enactment throughout 
Australia of laws providing for the recording of statements made between police 
and  suspects.    On  this  footing,  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  impugned 
statement was inadmissible.  It should have been rejected at his trial pursuant to 
the  applicable  Tasmanian  law,  namely  the  Criminal  Law  (Detention  and 
Interrogation) Act 1995 (Tas) (""the Act"")102. 
 
 
The  trial  judge  rejected  the  appellant's  submission.    A  majority  of  the 
Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania confirmed that ruling103.  However, one 
judge  in  that  court  (Slicer J)  dissented  on  this  point104.    He  held  that  the  Act 
rendered  the  impugned  statement  inadmissible  and  that  it  should  therefore  not 
have been received before the jury.   
 
 
Notwithstanding this opinion, Slicer J, by reference to the other evidence 
adduced at the trial, found that the appellant's case was one for the application of 
the ""proviso"" governing criminal appeals105.  Concluding that there had been no 
miscarriage of justice, he affirmed the outcome of the trial reflected in the jury's 
verdict  that  the  appellant  was  guilty  of  the  murder  of  the  deceased.    He  had 
therefore been properly convicted of that crime.   
 
 
Before this Court, the appellant supports the approach to the application of 
the  Act  accepted  by  the  dissenting  judge.    However,  he  contends  that  the 
""proviso"" was unavailable or ought not to have been applied in his case.

The facts, legislation and decisional history 
 
The facts are stated in the reasons of the other members of this Court106.  
 
Also contained there are the relevant provisions of the Act107, as it stood at the 
applicable time, namely ""[o]n the trial of [the appellant] for a serious offence""108.  
The  appellant's  trial  for  the  offence  of  murder  was  for  a  ""serious  offence""  as 
defined109. 
 
 
The other reasons also contain an account of the dismissal of the objection 
to the admission of the impugned statement at trial110 and the respective decisions 
of the majority111 and of the dissenting judge112 in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
It will be necessary to say a little more about the reasons that led to the dissent.  
However, sufficient appears to demonstrate that this is another case concerning a 
dispute  over  statutory  language  in  respect  of  which  differing  conclusions  have 
been reached below and now in this Court.  Those conclusions are influenced by 
the  conflicting  attractions  to  the  judicial  mind  of  the  verbal  expression  of  the 
statutory prescription and of the apparent purpose which that prescription seeks 
to attain. 
 
The issues 
 
 
 
(1) 

The confession/admission issue:  Whether, within the Act113, the impugned 
statement was evidence of any ""confession or admission"" by an accused 
person114. 

The following issues arise on the appeal:

The course of questioning issue:  Whether, if the impugned statement did 
constitute evidence of a confession or admission, in the general sense, it 
fell within the statutory requirement, essential to attract the protection of 
the Act, namely that it ""was made in the course of official questioning""115. 

The admissibility issue:  If the impugned statement was a ""confession or 
admission""  within  the  foregoing  requirements,  whether  the  trial  judge 
erred, in the circumstances, in ruling that it was admissible and whether 
the  majority  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  erred  in  confirming  that 
ruling. 

The availability of the proviso issue:  Whether, in the circumstances that 
the  prosecution  did  not  expressly  rely  in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal 
upon the ""proviso"", it was open to the dissenting judge to conclude that 
the  ""proviso""  applied  and  whether,  in  any  case,  the  ""proviso""  was 
available to this Court. 

The application of the proviso issue:  Whether, if the impugned statement 
was inadmissible, and ought to have been rejected, and the ""proviso"" was 
available,  it  applies  on  the  ground  that  no  miscarriage  of  justice  has 
actually occurred, so that the appellant's conviction ought to be confirmed. 

 
Narrowing the issues 
 
The confession/admission issue:  I agree with the reasons of Gleeson CJ, 
 
Hayne and Heydon JJ (""joint reasons"") that it would be undesirable in this case to 
resolve  any  controversy  that  may  exist  concerning  whether  the  impugned 
statement was a ""confession or admission"" in the general sense of those words116.  
Although I am inclined to believe that the impugned statement falls within the 
ambit of those words, at least as they are used in this statutory context117, it is not 
essential  in  this  appeal  to  determine  that  point.    It  was  not  argued  before  the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeal.    I  will  therefore  assume  that  the  statement,  if 
otherwise  falling  within  the  requirements  of  the  Act,  was  a  ""confession  or 
admission"".  But I will not decide that issue.   
 
The  admissibility  issue:    Passing  over  the  course  of  questioning  issue,  I 
 
can  likewise  dispose  quickly  of  the  admissibility  issue.    If,  otherwise,  the

impugned statement was a ""confession or admission"", it certainly fell within the 
first  statutory  requirement  of  the  special  definition  of  that  expression  in  the 
Act118.    The  impugned  statement  was  made  by  the  appellant  as  an  ""accused 
person"".    At  the  time  it  was  made,  he  ""was  or  ought  reasonably  to  have  been 
suspected by  a police  officer of having committed an offence"".  Indeed, at the 
relevant time, the appellant was about to be taken, in the company of Detective 
Sergeant  Lopes  and  Detective  Pretyman,  to  a  hospital  for  the  purpose  of 
obtaining body samples for police investigative purposes.  This was a course of 
conduct  that  could  only  be  explained  on  the  footing  that,  at  that  time,  the 
appellant was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected of having committed 
an offence.  I did not take this point to be contested.   
 
 
Nor  could  I  conclude  that,  if  otherwise  the  impugned  statement  was 
inadmissible,  any  of  the  qualifications  and  exemptions  contained  in  the  Act119 
were made out.  Although an extensive videotape of a protracted police interview 
with  the  appellant  was  available  to  the  court,  there  was  no  videotape  of  the 
impugned statement120.  Nor did the prosecution prove that there was available to 
the court a videotape of an interview with the appellant ""about the making and 
terms  of  the  confession  or  admission  or  the  substance  [of  it]  in  the  course  of 
which the [appellant] states that he … made a confession or an admission"" in the 
same  or  substantially  similar  terms  to  the  impugned  statement121.    Nor  did  the 
prosecution  prove  that  there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  as  to  why  the 
videotape referred to in both of the preceding provisions (including a subsequent 
interview on videotape) could not have been made122.   
 
 
Finally,  if  all  other  requirements  were  established,  and  particularly 
because of the failure of the police officers to do what could readily have been 
done  (take  the  appellant  back  to  the  interviewing  room,  recommence  the 
interview and confront him with the impugned statement) I am unconvinced that 
""exceptional  circumstances""  have  been  demonstrated  which,  in  the  interests  of 
justice,  would  justify  the  admission  of  the  evidence  in  the  case123.    No  such 
finding has ever been made by any judge who has considered the matter.

On  these  assumptions,  if  otherwise  the  impugned  statement  was  a 
""confession or admission"" within the Act, it was not admissible and should have 
been excluded at the trial.  I shall return to this issue. 
 
The availability of the proviso issue:  Whatever was the correctness of the 
 
approach of the dissenting judge in the Court of Criminal Appeal, in reaching his 
conclusions  upon  the  basis  of  the  ""proviso""  not  relied  upon  in  that  Court  (a 
matter  upon  which  I  say  nothing),  there  was  no  legal  inhibition  upon  the 
prosecution's reliance on the ""proviso"" in this Court.  In this, I also agree with the 
joint reasons124.   
 
 
Before  this  Court,  the  question  of  the  application  of  the  ""proviso""  was 
fully argued and rightly so because of the nature of the appeal and the evidence 
adduced against the appellant at his trial.  In the Tasmanian Criminal Code the 
""proviso"" appears in conventional terms.  It is addressed to the ""[d]etermination 
of appeals"", in the sense of appeals against the judgment or order of the court of 
trial,  relevantly  where  a  ""wrong  decision  of  any  question  of  law""  is  shown125.  
The  language  of  the  Criminal  Code  permits  the  Court  (meaning  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeal),  notwithstanding  the  demonstration  of  error,  to  ""dismiss  the 
appeal  if  it  considers  that  no  substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  has  actually 
occurred""126.   
 
 
This  Court  is  empowered  to  make  the  order  which  ought  to  have  been 
made below127.  As the application of the ""proviso"" has been fully argued in this 
Court,  if  otherwise  the  appellant  demonstrated  the  inadmissibility  of  the 
impugned statement, it would be necessary for this Court to decide the point.  No 
inhibition  or  impediment  arises  because  of  the  way  in  which  the  prosecution 
presented the issues in the Court of Criminal Appeal128.   
 
 
It  cannot  be  suggested  that  there  is  any  procedural  unfairness  to  the 
appellant  by  adopting  this  course.    The  entire  evidence  at  the  trial  is  on  the 
record.  It is open to this Court to consider that record.  So it did, on the footing

of extensive submissions about the case against the appellant, and the evidence 
and arguments presented at trial by both sides. 
 
The application of the proviso issue:  I agree with the reasons of the other 
 
members  of  this  Court,129  that  the  prosecution  case  against  the  appellant  was 
overwhelming and compelling. 
 
 
Although I was party to the decision to grant special leave to the appellant, 
I did so substantially upon the basis of the suggested importance of the course of 
questioning issue and because similar questions have arisen under like legislation 
in other States.  A greater familiarity with the evidence in the appellant's case, 
permitted by full argument in the appeal, sustained, in retrospect, the submission 
of the prosecution at the special leave hearing.  This was not, in the end, a very 
suitable case in which to resolve the contested point of statutory construction.   
 
 
This was so because,  even if the appellant's submissions were accepted, 
they  cannot  affect  the  outcome  of  his  case.    The  evidence  against  him  was 
overwhelming.  His conviction was inevitable130.  Although the jury deliberated 
for over 18 hours131 this (as Slicer J observed) was an indication of their careful 
consideration of the mass of evidence, lengthy addresses and detailed summing 
up that followed a  trial involving three accused and 70 witnesses  which lasted 
over eight weeks132.  One of the co-accused in that trial, Mr Williams, was found 
not  guilty.    The  differential  consideration  of  his  case  (where  the  inculpating 
evidence was much weaker and unconfirmed) provides one clear reason for the 
length of the jury's deliberations.  So does the seriousness of the consequence of 
the verdict of guilty in the cases of the other accused, including the appellant. 
 
 
Apart  from  everything  else,  so  far  as  the  ""proviso""  is  concerned,  two 
particular features weigh in my assessment of whether a ""miscarriage of justice"" 
is shown in the appellant's case.  The first is the strong summing up to the jury by 
the trial judge concerning the particular care with which they should approach the 
weight to be given to the impugned statement, taking into account the fact that it

had  not  been  confirmed  by  recording  or  other  independent  means133.    The 
directions  given  by  the  trial  judge  were  harmonious,  in  this  regard,  with  the 
instruction of this Court in McKinney v The Queen134.  Counsel for the appellant 
properly conceded that the trial judge's direction was a ""full"" one, ""warning of 
the dangers of relying on unrecorded incriminating statements said to have been 
made by accused persons"" to those in authority. 
 
 
Secondly,  in  the  context  of  the  entirety  of  the  trial,  and  the  very  strong 
prosecution  case  against  the  appellant,  the  impugned  statement  would  have 
played an insignificant role (if any) in the deliberations of the jury.  I agree with 
the  dissenting  judge  that  the  impugned  statement  was  but  a  minor  addition  to 
other, more inculpatory contradictions, evasions and indications suggesting that 
the  appellant  was  ""playing  a  game"",  which  was  what  he  was  alleged  to  have 
conveyed  in  the  impugned  statement.    In  that  sense,  viewed  in  context,  the 
impugned  statement,  when  received  into  evidence,  ""did  little  to  enhance  the 
prosecution's  case"".    Isolated  and  put  under  a  forensic  microscope,  the 
significance  of  the  statement  can  be  painted  as  important.    However,  in  ""the 
context  of  this  case,  the  identified  evidence  does  not  suggest  a  'miscarriage  of 
justice'""135.   
 
 
A reflection of this impression may be found in the fact that, having lost 
the  objection  to  the  admissibility  of  the  impugned  statement,  the  appellant  did 
not, at the trial, seek its exclusion on the basis of an exercise by the trial judge of 
his  residual  discretion  to  reject  evidence  where  its  prejudice  outweighed  its 
probative value.  The course of the trial confirms my impression that the point of 
objection raised for the appellant was, and was only, a technical one of principle 
based on the language of the Act.  It was not, as such, one based on the potency 
of  the  statement  to  prejudice  the  appellant's  case,  when  that  statement  was 
viewed in the context of the trial as a whole. 
 
 
The result is that, reserving for the moment the course of questioning issue 
raised  by  the  meaning  of  the  Act,  all  of  the  issues  presented  in  the  appeal  are 
determined  against  the  appellant  with  the  result  that  his  appeal  must  fail.    I 
acknowledge that this involves taking the consideration of the ""proviso"" out of its 
proper  order.    In  terms  of  the  Criminal  Code  and  logic,  consideration  of  the 
""proviso"" does not strictly arise until some ""point raised by the appeal might be

decided in favour of the appellant""136.  Relevantly, this occurs on a demonstration 
of a ""wrong decision of any question of law"" in the course of the trial137.  As a 
matter of strict law, consideration of the ""proviso"" should therefore be postponed 
until  any  errors  complained  of  by  an  appellant  in  a  criminal  appeal  are 
determined and the accuracy and safety of the trial can then be viewed in their 
entirety138.   
 
 
Nevertheless,  in  this  appeal  I  have  proceeded  directly  to  the  ""proviso"" 
issue,  on  an  assumption  that  a  wrong  decision  on  a  question  of  law  could  be 
established on the course of questioning issue, warranting a decision in favour of 
the  appellant.    I  have  done  so  because  the  case  against  the  appellant  was  so 
overwhelming  that  a  real  question  was  presented  to  my  mind  as  to  whether 
special leave should be revoked139. 
 
 
However,  having  come  so  far,  and  narrowed  the  issues  as  I  have,  it  is 
appropriate  to  respond  to  the  arguments  of  the  appellant  on  the  course  of 
questioning  issue,  if  only  because,  in  the  end,  I  have  reached  a  conclusion 
different from the majority.  But for the foregoing reasons, it is not a conclusion 
that  warrants  disturbance  of  the  unanimous  order  of  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeal. 
 
The course of official questioning 
 
The purpose of contested words:  I agree with much of the joint reasons on 
 
the  remaining  issue.    Those  reasons  have  explained  the  background  against 
which the provisions of the Act in issue in this appeal have to be read.  For some 
time, the problem of confessions to police, and specifically of so-called ""police 
verbals""140  bedevilled  the  administration  of  criminal  justice  in  Australia,  as  in 
other countries.  It came under particular attention in decisions of this Court in 
the 1970s141 and 1980s142.

As  the  other  members  of  this  Court  explain,  public,  judicial,  police  and 
other concerns about the problems of contested oral and written confessions and 
admissions  to  police  resulted  in  law  reform  and  similar  reports143,  as  well  as 
insistence on the part of this Court upon heightened scrutiny by trial judges and 
intermediate  appellate  courts  throughout  Australia.    Eventually,  this  Court,  in 
McKinney established  a new rule of practice.  That rule obliged trial judges to 
give strong directions to juries, warning against findings of guilt based only (or 
substantially only) on confessions allegedly made in official custody, unless the 
making  was  reliably  corroborated  (as  by  electronic  recording,  especially  video 
recording).   
 
Duty  to  the  statutory  language:    There  is  no  doubt  that  the  decision  in 
 
McKinney144  worked  a  considerable,  and  beneficial,  change  in  police  practice, 
prosecution  conduct  of  trials,  judicial  vigilance  and  appellate  scrutiny.    It  also 
stimulated  legislative  changes,  introduced  in  federal,  State  and  Territory  law.  
These  changes,  and  the  variations  amongst  them,  are  explained  in  the  joint 
reasons145.    They  support  the  observation  that  the  solution  to  the  legal  issue 
remaining in this appeal is not to be found in generalities or perceived necessities 
to tackle globally the problem of unreliable confessions or admissions to officials 
or ""police verbals"".  In each case, where legislation has been enacted to express 
the requirements of the law, such requirements will be found in the terms of the 
legislation.   
 
 
Because that legislation varies, as the joint reasons have demonstrated, in 
significant ways in different parts of Australia (and in the case of Queensland in

different terms at different times)146, it is essential to determine contested issues 
of  admissibility  by  reference  to  each  statutory  prescription  that  governs  the 
matter.    If  it  should  prove  that  such  prescription  is  inadequate  to  meet  every 
problem of disputed confessions and admissions or every case of ""police verbals"" 
perceived as offending against the principles stated in McKinney, the courts are 
not bereft of remedies.  The rule in  McKinney still applies.   Trial  judges  must 
give  the  warning  mandated  by  that  decision  for  residual  cases  of  contested 
confessions and admissions.  This was done in the present case. 
 
In appropriate circumstances, subject to any legislative prescription to the 
 
contrary,  judges  also  retain  a  residual  power  to  exclude  such  confessions  and 
admissions  where  the  prejudice  of  admitting  them  would  outweigh  their 
probative  value147.    What  is  not  permissible,  in  response  to  the  differentiated 
legislation enacted by the legislatures for the several jurisdictions of Australia, is 
the  imposition  by  this  Court  of  a  common  rule  that  ignores,  or  overrides,  the 
terms of the law as validly enacted  by those legislatures to govern such cases.  
Ultimately,  in  every  case,  where  legislation  has  been  enacted,  it  is  the  duty  of 
courts  if  the  legislation  is  valid  to  give  effect  to  it  according  to  its  terms.  
Statutory construction is a text-based activity148. 
 
Finding  the  legislative  purpose:    Having  said  this,  the  meaning  of  the 
 
expression ""in the course of official questioning"" in the Tasmanian Act in issue 
in this appeal remains to be ascertained.  The ambit of that expression will  be 
clarified by the circumstances of particular cases.  The task of a court, obliged to 
give  meaning  to  the  expression,  is  to  apply  the  statutory  words  to  the  case  in 
hand.    The  task  of  this  Court,  in  elucidating  the  expression,  is  to  do  so  by 
reference  to  general  principles  that  will  assist  in  the  later  application  of  the

legislation, and like provisions, in a wide range of cases in which circumstances 
will inevitably be different and the statutory words will need to be given content. 
 
 
To  perform  the  function  of  elucidating  statutory  meaning,  this  Court,  in 
recent times, has moved away from a purely verbal or linguistic approach to a 
broader, or ""purposive"", approach149.  There are now too many cases in which the 
Court  has  endorsed  the  ""purposive""  approach  to  warrant  a  return  to  narrow 
textualism.  Nothing in the reasoning of the joint reasons in this appeal contests 
these propositions.  However, the majority feel compelled by the language of the 
Act, particularly when considered beside alternative legislative formulations, to 
conclude that the reference to ""in the course of official questioning"" excludes the 
circumstances  of  the  impugned  statement  allegedly  made  by  the  appellant  to 
police in the police carpark.   
 
 
The  ""purpose""  can,  of  course,  only  extend  so  far  as  the  statutory 
prescription  provides.    Because  that  prescription  is  seen  as  amounting  to  a 
""compromise"" on the part of the Tasmanian Parliament150, it does not extend in 
the majority's opinion to a case such as the present.  They conclude that, for a 
court  to  say  otherwise,  involves  an  invalid  expansion  of  the  legislative 
prescription in accordance with a ""purpose"" larger than that which the Tasmanian 
Parliament ultimately endorsed. 
 
 
I  accept  the  force  of  the  majority's  reasoning.    As  in  most  cases  of 
statutory construction reaching this Court, there are arguments both ways.  In the 
end,  however,  I  have  concluded,  alike  with  McHugh J  and  Slicer J,  that  the 
words  ""in  the  course  of  official  questioning""  extend  to  circumstances  such  as 
those in which the impugned statement was made.  I must therefore explain the 
steps that lead me to this conclusion. 
 
Official questioning during police detention:  First, it is proper to start the 
 
task of interpretation by viewing the contested phrase (""in the course of official 
questioning"")  in  a  context  larger  than  the  words  taken  in  isolation.    The 
differences  in  the  legislative  responses,  in  Australia  and  elsewhere,  to  the 
problem of contested confessions and admissions to officials and ""police verbals"" 
must be given due weight.  But so must the generic problem to which, in their 
differing ways, the legislative texts respond.

As  Slicer J  points  out  in  his  dissenting  opinion  below151,  the  problem 
 
presented by such confessions and admissions was not only that of protecting the 
innocent accused against wrongful conviction.  It was also, in words of Lamer J 
in Rothman v The Queen152, borrowed by Slicer J, ""the protection of the system 
itself by ensuring that the repression of crime through the conviction of the guilty 
is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a society"".  Because, in 
Australia,  such  protection  lies  substantially  in  the  hands  of  the  judiciary,  in 
ascertaining the meaning of legislative prescriptions such as those in the Act, it is 
essential  that  real  weight  should  be  given  to  the  serious  problem  for  the 
administration of criminal justice that such legislation addresses.   
 
 
I  agree  with  Slicer J's  remark,  referring  to  the  successive  rulings  of  this 
Court in such cases as Cleland v The Queen153 and McKinney154.   His Honour 
observed155: 
 

""At one level a statement of those rights transcend the rights of an accused 
person.  Instead, the statement is one touching the values of our society 
and  defines  who  we  are.    A  culture  of  law  enforcement  which  permits 
possible abuse of power is not in the interests of society as a whole."" 

 
Abuse of power is not in the interests of the courts, of the accused or of 
public confidence in the police.  It is therefore appropriate, where an Australian 
legislature has responded to the problems identified by this Court over a space of 
two decades in the 1970s and 1980s, to give to any ambiguity that appears in the 
legislation a construction that ensures that it responds to the problem, so far as 
the language  permits.   The days have  passed when courts find any  pleasure in 
concluding that reformatory legislation is addressed to a problem but has missed 
its target156.  That is the important difference introduced by the adoption of the 
""purposive""  approach  to  statutory  interpretation.    It  has  its  limits.    But  in  the

present  case,  the  existence  of  a  relevant  ""purpose""  is  indicated  by  too  many 
judicial  statements,  official  reports  and  legislative  enactments  to  deny  its 
significance.   
 
 
On  the  face  of  things,  therefore,  an  interpretation  of  ""in  the  course  of 
official  questioning""  that  was  confined  to  the  room  at  police  headquarters  in 
which video recording equipment was set up, and which did not extend to words 
used by the accused soon after departing that room when he was still in police 
detention,  would  seriously  undermine  the  statutory  ""purpose""  of  requiring  a 
video  recording  of  such  exchanges.    It  would  also  undermine  so  much  of  the 
""purpose""  as  was  addressed  to  responding  to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in 
McKinney  and  the  direction  which  that  case  obliged  judges  to  give  to  juries 
concerning  the  danger  of  ""police  verbals"".    Arguably,  the  impugned  statement 
would fall within that description.  The starting point of analysis, then, is that the 
statement would appear to fall within a legislative provision addressed generally 
to  remedy  contested  and  unconfirmed  statements  to  police  officers  by  accused 
suspects whilst detained by them. 
 
 
Secondly, specific confirmation  that this was the general purpose  of the 
Tasmanian Act may be found in the nature of the Act and the statement of the 
Attorney-General  explaining  its  object  to  the  Tasmanian  Parliament  and  the 
balance that it sought to strike.   
 
The  Minister  for  Justice,  in  his  Second  Reading  Speech,  told  the 
 
Tasmanian Parliament that the Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Bill 
1995  (Tas)  had  its  genesis  in  a  report  of  the  Law  Reform  Commissioner  of 
Tasmania157.  That report had been accepted by the Government.  As its short title 
indicated, its purpose was to enhance police powers of detention of suspects but 
upon  conditions  that  responded  to  the  revealed  problem  of  misuse  of  police 
powers.    That  problem  included  the  contested  attribution  of  confessions  and 
admissions to accused persons in police detention which could not be confirmed 
in some objective and reliable way and against which the accused was in a very 
vulnerable  position  to  launch  an  attack,  especially  if  he  or  she  had  a  criminal 
record.   
 
 
In  short,  according  to  the  Minister  a  new  balance  was  to  be  struck  in 
Tasmania.  Police were to secure larger powers of detention.  But they were also 
to be subject to new requirements to ""videotape … an interview with the accused 
person,  in  the  course  of  which  [a]  confession  or  admission  was  made""  as  a

precondition  to  the  admission  of  evidence  of  ""any  confessional  admission""  in 
specified trials158.   
 
 
The word ""interview"" is used in the Act, although not precisely as it is in 
other  legislative  prescriptions159.    It  is  clear  that  the  Minister  understood  the 
expression  ""in  the  course  of  official  questioning""  in  the  Tasmanian  Act  to  be 
generally  equivalent  to  the  expression  ""interview""  which  he  adopted  as  a 
shorthand  synonym.    Textual  support  for  the  proposition  that  the  Act  was 
designed  to  strike  a  new  balance  between  enlarged  police  powers  and  new 
protective requirements governing confessions and admissions can be seen in the 
short title of the Act, with its reference both to ""detention"" and ""interrogation"".  
Further, its provisions address each of these purposes.  It would be contrary to 
the clear purpose of the Act, as explained by the Minister, to construe it so as to 
enlarge  the  powers  of  police  detention  without  significantly  enhancing  the 
security of the confessions and admissions obtained during such detention.  The 
construction favoured by the joint reasons undermines the balance apparent in the 
language of the Act. 
 
 
Thirdly, there are other textual indications that the Act was to extend to 
confessions  and  admissions  allegedly  made  whilst  an  accused  was  in  police 
detention,  in  circumstances  such  as  that  involving  the  appellant  when  the 
impugned statement was said to have been made.   
 
The  ""trigger""  for  the  initiation  of  the  application  of  the  new  protections 
 
was  the  moment,  provided  in  s 8(1)(a)  of  the  Act,  when  the  police  officer  to 
whom the confession or admission was made suspected, or ought reasonably to 
have suspected, the accused of having committed an offence.  Whilst it is true 
that this ""trigger"" would exclude from protection confessional statements made 
before  that  level  of  suspicion  was  reached  (and  hence  would  not  protect  a 
statement  blurted  out  by  a  person  at  a  crime  scene  or  on  the  telephone  before 
suspicion attached), the initiation of the obligation is significant.  On the face of 
things,  one  would  draw  from  the  text  an  inference  that  the  obligation  would 
continue thereafter, so long as the accused was, or ought reasonably to have been, 
suspected  and  until  the  police  officer  concerned  had  discharged  his  or  her 
policing function.

Of  its  nature,  the  policing  function  involving  the  appellant  was  not 
concluded by switching off a video or audio recorder.  It was only discharged by 
police taking the steps contemplated by the Act and transferring responsibility of 
the  accused  from  the  power  of  the  Executive  Government,  to  the  power  of  an 
officer in the independent judicial branch of government.  So much appears to be 
indicated  by  a  functional,  as  distinct  from  a  purely  verbal,  analysis  of  the  Act 
with  its  reference  to  the  initiation  of  police  duties  on  the  basis  of  actual  or 
reasonable suspicion of an offence.   
 
The  problem  presented  by  the  Act  is  a  new  manifestation  of  an  old 
 
controversy.  In the past, the existence of an actual or reasonable suspicion of an 
offence  was  the  ""trigger""  to  impose  upon  police  duties  the  responsibility  to 
administer warnings to the accused and to bring the accused promptly before a 
judicial  officer160.    That  duty  continued  until  it  was  discharged.    Given  the 
reformatory purposes of the Act, it would be an odd construction to excuse the 
police  officer  of  the  duty  to  record  the  confession  or  admission  on  videotape 
whilst the accused was still under suspicion, in detention and before he or she 
had been brought before a judicial officer for disposition in accordance with the 
general law.  The phrase ""in the course of official questioning"" takes its colour 
and meaning from that law. 
 
 
Fourthly,  there  are  still  other  textual  indications  in  the  Act  that  this 
broader view of its operation should be preferred.  The width of the expression 
""questioning by a police officer"" is demonstrated by the indication that it applies 
so  long  as  the  questioning  is  ""in  connection  with  the  investigation  of  the 
commission  or  the  possible  commission  of  an  offence""161.    Such  words  of 
connection could not be broader.  Certainly, at the time the alleged confession or 
admission was made in the form of the impugned statement, the appellant was in 
police  detention  in  such  a  ""connection"".    The  ""investigation""  by  police  was 
continuing.  The appellant was being taken to a hospital to procure body samples 
precisely for the investigative purpose. 
                                                                                                                                     
160  At common law police (and private citizens) had the power of arrest only for the 
purpose of taking the suspect promptly before a justice or magistrate to be dealt 
with according to law.    See  Dallison v Caffery  [1965] 1 QB 348  at 366-367 per 
Lord  Denning MR;  R v  Banner  [1970]  VR  240  at  249-250.    Australian  Law 
Reform Commission, Criminal Investigation, Report No 2, (1975),  Interim at 38 
[87].    As  there  pointed  out,  in  most  Australian  jurisdictions,  legislation  gave 
statutory expression to the common law principle delimiting the permissible time 
by  the  use  of  various  words  of  urgency:    ""forthwith"",  ""without  delay"",  ""without 
undue delay"", ""as soon as practicable"", ""not longer than is reasonably necessary in 
the circumstances"", ""within twenty-four hours"", and ""within forty-eight hours … or 
if not practicable … as soon as practicable after that period"".

There  are  additional  textual  clues.    One  well-established  technique  of 
""questioning"" persons in official custody involves prolonged silence on the part 
of the questioner.  In such circumstances, the subjects of interrogation often feel 
a need to fill the silences with elaboration, explanation, justification, exculpation, 
pleas  and  excuses.    It  would  be  unthinkable,  given  the  purpose  of  the  Act,  to 
suggest that statements of such a kind, made by a person in police detention to a 
police  officer,  who  actually  or  reasonably  suspects  that  person  of  having 
committed  an  offence,  fall  outside  the  protection  of  the  Act  because  not 
responsive to ""questioning"".  Clearly, ""questioning"" must include silences on the 
part of the police.  Yet, if such silences are included whilst the accused person is 
in  police  detention  in  connection  with  the  investigation  of  the  commission  or 
possible commission of an offence, in a police station or building, it is impossible 
in logic to exclude similar silences when the accused is under police detention in 
a nearby police carpark when identical or equivalent statements are made to the 
police officer engaged in the investigation.  The line of demarcation cannot be 
drawn at the door of the police building, still less the door of the police facility 
for the video recording of confessions and admissions. 
 
 
Fifthly, further confirmation that this is so is found in the textual provision 
contemplating that a confession or admission by an accused person, not recorded 
on videotape, should ordinarily result in a follow up interview with the accused 
person on videotape about the making and terms of the confession or admission 
or the substance thereof162.  This provision indicates Parliament's purpose where 
a  confession  or  admission  is  not  recorded  on  videotape,  namely  that  the 
opportunity  should be  taken immediately to  provide the facility of a follow-up 
recording.  Otherwise, the prosecution is required by the Act to prove that there 
was a reasonable explanation as to why the alleged confession or admission was 
not recorded on videotape or presented for follow-up recording163.   
 
 
Confronting the appellant with the impugned statement on video recording 
would  not  have  been  a  difficult  task  in  the  circumstances  of  the  present  case.  
When the impugned statement was made, the police detaining the appellant were 
still  in  the  vicinity  of  the  police  building,  only  minutes  away  from  the  video 
recorder.  It would have been a small inconvenience to return the appellant to the 
videotape  recording  facility  to  confront  him  with  the  accusation  of  his  alleged 
additional statement.  Then, the jury would have had the benefit of a prompt and 
contemporaneous  assertion  by  police  of  what  the  appellant  had  said  and  a 
recording of the appellant's immediate response.

The  object  of  the  Act  was  to  discourage  ""police  verbals"",  to  promote 
police  integrity,  to  save  court  time  and  to  ease  the  task  of  the  jury  by  such 
procedures.  I agree with the joint reasons that the prosecutor's argument, that the 
Act was addressed solely or mainly to unsigned written confessions, should be 
rejected164.    The  procedures  spelt  out  in  the  Act  indicate  a  parliamentary 
consciousness  of  the  risks  and  difficulties  presented  by  just  such  an  oral 
exchange as was alleged to have happened in the appellant's impugned statement.  
Given the language and objects of the Act, it cannot be the case that it is left to 
police  officers  alone  to  determine  conclusively  when  the  ""course  of  official 
questioning"" is concluded.   
 
 
Yet,  by  adopting  the  approach  stated  in  the  joint  reasons,  that  ""official 
questioning""  concluded  with  the  statement  to  that  effect  by  the  interrogating 
police officer, the switching off of the video recording and departure from the 
police recording room, effectively it is left to police to mark the boundaries of the 
obligations  imposed  upon  them  by  Parliament.    Such  a  construction  is 
unacceptable given that the object of the Act was to put checks on the conduct of 
police officers.  It would seriously undermine the achievement of that object to 
permit those placed under scrutiny to determine the limits and termination of the 
duration of their own scrutiny.  A more objective criterion, consonant with the 
language and objects of the Act, must be adopted. 
 
 
Sixthly,  adopting  such  an  objective  criterion  for  the  terminus  of  ""in  the 
course of official questioning"" would also be consonant with the approach of the 
English courts to equivalent provisions in their law.  It should not be thought that 
the problem of oral statements to police officers immediately before, and more 
particularly immediately after, the formal interviewing stage is one confined to 
the  courts  of  Australia  or  Tasmania.    On  the  contrary,  soon  after  a  law  was 
adopted  in  England  to  require  recording  of  certain  events  involving  police 
investigation of offences, similar problems arose.  This Court is also aware that 
like questions have also arisen elsewhere in Australia165.  Whilst each problem of 
such a kind must be solved by reference to the applicable legislation, Australian 
courts  can  derive  assistance  from  fifteen  years  of  consideration  by  the  English 
courts of the difficulties inherent in such legislation.   
 
 
The common challenge is that, whatever verbal formula is adopted, it will 
not anticipate all of the circumstances by which, licitly or illicitly, attempts are 
made  to  adduce  evidence  of  confessions  and  admissions  to  police  occurring 
outside the formal part of an ""interview"" or ""official questioning"".  The narrower 
the  approach  to  those  concepts,  ""the  more  likely  it  is  that  conversations,

discussions,  informal  chats,  talks,  introductory  remarks  and  other  expressions 
denoting communication between suspect and police officer will fall outside the 
ambit"" of the legislation to the destruction of its effectiveness166.   
 
In 1989, in Matthews167, Morland J, in the English Court of Appeal, said 
 
that it was ""not within the spirit of the Act or the code that 'interview' should be 
given a restricted  meaning"".  The same should be said about ""in the course  of 
official questioning"" in the Tasmanian Act.  There is no reason why this Court 
should  adopt  an  approach  different  from  that  adopted  by  the  English  Court  of 
Appeal.  There is every reason of principle and policy why it should not. 
 
 
The  joint  reasons  contain  reference  to  another  decision  of  the  English 
Court of Appeal in Bryce168.  However, that decision by no means concludes the 
list  of  English  cases.    A  number  of  them  are  collected  by  Slicer J  in  his 
reasons169.    They  extend  from  Maguire170  and  Clarke171  in  1989  through  to 
Cox172,  R v  Purcell173  and  Ward174.    I  agree  with  the  analysis  of  Slicer J  that, 
despite some inconsistencies (as for example in R v Younis and Ahmed175), it can 
be said with certainty that ""the theme of the English authorities is one designed to 
prevent the admission of 'verbals'""176.  The falling off in the number of such cases 
in recent years in England suggests that the approach to interpretation adopted by

the  English  courts  has  had  the  desired  result,  so  that  alleged  confessions  and 
admissions of police, subsequently tendered by the prosecution in evidence at a 
trial,  are  almost  invariably  recorded  on  video  film  initially  or  presented  to  the 
accused on video film immediately after an impugned statement is made so that 
the accusation is recorded contemporaneously and has the chance to respond in a 
way that will be available to the jury. 
 
 
The  English  cases  are  said  to  be  distinguishable  on  the  basis  that  the 
legislative  language  is  different  from  that  of  the  Act.    It  is  true  that  there  are 
points of difference.  However, in my view, alike with Slicer J, it is open to this 
Court to construe the phrase ""official questioning"" to have the meaning preferred 
by the English Court of Appeal in respect of the conduct of interviews and the 
consequences of ""anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances 
existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made … 
in  consequence  thereof""177.    The  phrase  in  the  Tasmanian  Act  is  opaque  and 
ambiguous.  Only the construction that McHugh J and I favour gives full effect to 
the  language  consistently  with  the  purpose  and  scheme  of  the  Act.    Only  that 
construction avoids the effective self-determination by police of the conclusion 
of  the  ""course  of  official  questioning"",  inherent  in  the  alternative  view.    That 
view cannot stand with the history of this legislation, its purpose and intended 
operation, derived from all of its provisions.  It is not necessary to its language. 
 
Conclusion:    ambit  of  recording  obligation:    It follows  that  I  prefer  the 
 
approach  of  Slicer J  in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal.    However,  I  would  not 
express the ambit of the obligation of recording of confessions and admissions to 
police officers in quite the same way as he did.  Notably, I would not do so by 
reference, as such, to ""custody"" of that person.   
 
 
Instead, using the language of the Act, I would conclude that the ""course 
of official questioning"" begins, in the case of an accused person who is or ought 
reasonably have been suspected of an offence and who is later tried for a serious 
offence,  when  that  reasonable  suspicion  arose,  or  ought  reasonably  to  have 
arisen,  in  the  minds  of  the  police  officers  detaining  that  person.    It  is  not 
terminated or interrupted by silence on the part of the police officer.  It includes 
responsive or unresponsive statements made whilst the accused is detained by the 
police  officer  in  connection  with  the  investigation  of  the  commission,  or  the 
possible commission, of an offence.  The official questioning is not concluded at 
the  termination  of  any  formal  interview,  the  termination  by  police  of  video 
recording  or  other  decisions  wholly  within  the  power  of  police  officers.    The 
termination only occurs when the investigation of the offence whilst the accused

person is in police detention178 is terminated either by the release of that person 
or  by  the  action  of  police  in  bringing  the  accused  to  a  judicial  officer  upon  a 
charge laid by the police officer concerning an offence.   
 
 
On the basis of this functional approach to the meaning of the Act, and on 
the assumption about the meaning of ""confession or admission"" in this context 
described above, the impugned statement, attributed to the appellant by Detective 
Sergeant Lopes and Detective Pretyman, was not admissible at his trial.  It ought 
to have been excluded from the evidence before the jury.  The trial judge, and the 
majority of the Court of Appeal, erred in deciding otherwise. 
 
Conclusion and order 
 
 
the 
admissibility  of  the  impugned  statement,  does  not  require  that  the  appeal  be

50,2757589,R v RM [2011] NSWSC 861,"Judgment 

1The accused is charged with the murder of her son, BM, on 24 August 2009. The trial of the accused has proceeded as a trial by judge alone after the accused made an election pursuant to s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to be tried in that fashion. The accused indicated that she had received advice from her solicitor before making the election and the Crown indicated its consent to the matter taking the course which was proposed. Section 133 of the Act casts certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict in such a trial. I have had regard to those obligations: Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. 

2It is common ground that the accused killed the deceased with the requisite intention to constitute the offence of murder. Accordingly, the only issue which I have to determine is whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the killing. Even upon that issue the evidence is all one way and the parties are in agreement that I should find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. 

Background to the fatal incident 

3The accused, who is aged 34, and her former de facto partner of five (5) years, DW, are the natural parents of BM who was 17 months old at the time of his death. The accused gave birth to BM by way of emergency c-section at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, on 18 March 2008. He was a healthy child at birth and remained in good health until his death. He was their only child. Although the couple resided together, it appears that for some time they had done so for the sake of their child. Indeed at the relevant time they were occupying separate bedrooms. 

4The accused was a practising psychologist, having graduated from the University of New England. She remained in practice until 2006, at which time she was the subject of a complaint to the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) by one of her former patients, as a result of which she was de-registered in 2008. 

5The police investigation shows that as a child the accused was exposed to sexually inappropriate behaviour by her step-father and her mother. She reported that her step-father was violent and that he made frequent threats to kill himself. The accused's medical records show that she has suffered from mental health issues, particularly anxiety, since her teenage years. The first recorded incident of a panic attack in which medical attention was sought was in 1992 when she was 15. I have been provided with a great deal of material which addresses those issues. Although I have had regard to it, it is unnecessary to refer to every aspect of it. The medical records link her mental health problems to her history of abuse as a child. 

6The accused has been hospitalised on two occasions after taking an overdose of prescribed medications. The first occasion was in May 2004. Her GP, Dr Bailey, reported that the accused was suffering from severe depression, anxiety and panic disorder and had attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs that had been prescribed for her. Dr Bailey arranged a referral to Dr Timothy McDonald, Consultant Psychiatrist. 

7In a report dated 4 June 2004, Dr McDonald observed that: 

[RM] gave a history of longstanding anxiety from childhood, which crystallised into panic attacks from the age of fifteen. She describes classic panic attacks, but no agoraphobic response. In her adult years the tendency has been for the anxiety to become more pervasive and severe. She has been in intensive psychotherapy, dealing with early childhood traumas, but this has not helped stem the flow of panic. 

8A week prior to that admission the accused was upset and crying and told her sister ""that I don't want to be scared anymore"". 

9The second occasion occurred in March 2007 when she was hospitalised for more than a fortnight. She was found to be mentally ill and was detained as a temporary patient. Her medical notes reveal that she experienced ""mood congruent auditory hallucinations"". For nearly three weeks prior to this admission, she reported having heard music which she interpreted as ""time to go"" and having heard voices (mumbling) talking about her. 

10Between 2006 and 2009 the accused had conversations with various people which revealed something of her deteriorating state of mind. For example, DW told police that the accused had battled with anxiety and panic attacks and depression. He noted that her anxiety made her fear things that sometimes were not there. He also informed police that ""something (played) on her mind...like, dark stuff, like things out to get her"". 

11Sharan Taylor first met the accused in 2005/6. They were both working in a healing centre in Cessnock. Several months after they met, the accused told Ms Taylor that she was ""soul mates"" with Eddie Van Halen (a member of the rock group Van Halen) and that he had tricked her by falsely claiming that he was coming to pick her up. 

12Another acquaintance, KG, reported that the accused was ""dealing with things such as aliens, past lives, foreign spirits and other 'weird' phenomena"" and that her behaviour was ""unusual and erratic"". KG said that the accused believed that there was a spaceship that shone a blue light onto her house which protected her and gave her energy. 

13According to her sister, the accused ""really started being weird"" at around about the time she commenced working at the healing centre. For instance, the accused claimed that she was seeing and communicating with dead people; that she was communicating telepathically with a friend of hers and with her sister's cat; that she was seeing ""signs"" and on one occasion that she was communicating with Eddie Van Halen to try and help him get off drugs. The accused's sister commented that ""you'd talk to her and it's like you were talking to three different people at once"". The accused's brother noticed similar behaviour. 

14CC, who had been the accused's partner for many years until they separated in 2006, noticed changes in the accused about the time that she commenced work in the healing centre. He said that in May 2006 the accused began to develop an obsession with the band Van Halen. On one occasion CC saw the accused listening to very loud Van Halen music through headphones. The accused told CC that she was ""listening for the message...the message that Eddie had encoded for me"". The accused also told him about a ""Reptilian Human Conspiracy Theory"" and told him that ""reptilians"" exist in positions of power around the world. 

15Deborah Horsey met the accused in mid 2008. The accused told her that UFOs were hovering over her house and that she had to get away. She said that they were attacking both her and BM. The accused also told her that she heard voices in her head and on one occasion she told Ms Horsey about ""reptilian aliens"". 

16On 9 October 2008 the accused told a long time friend, Brett Stone, that she had aerial surveillance because of a threat upon her life. As they were chatting outside, a light aircraft flew overhead. The accused told Mr Stone ""there are my boys overhead in the plane. Let's just give them a wave so they know I am OK"". The accused asserted that the threat to her life and to BM emanated from the former patient who had lodged a complaint with the HCCC. In an email to Mr Stone dated 4 October 2008 the accused wrote, inter alia, ""...current intel indicates that my former patient is still on the loose & out for blood - she's intelligent, psychotic & is a qualified private investigator - a lethal mix..."" 

17In August 2009 the accused met Andre Coppenrath and they shared some of their personal experiences with UFOs. The accused told Coppenrath that there was a mothercraft over her house and that she was scared of the ""reptiles"". She said that she was worried about them getting into her head and taking her away. She said that she was also worried about what they might do to BM. 

18On the day of the offence, DW was picked up from home by a colleague at about 6.00am. BM was awake at that time and was apparently in good spirits. The accused was also awake. After work, DW along with a number of co-workers, attended a local club before arriving home at about 6.00pm. On his arrival he heard what he believed to be the sound of the accused snoring in her room. He assumed that BM was asleep in his cot. He watched television for about an hour and then proceeded to prepare a bottle of formula for BM. Upon entering the bedroom with the bottle he peered into the cot and noticed a piece of paper across the chest of BM. The note read, ""I am sorry I had to protect [ BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me "". DW noticed that BM was cold to touch and that he was stiff. 

19DW went into the accused's bedroom and screamed at her to get up. The accused, after some delay, got out of bed but was both incoherent and completely disorientated. DW, in anger, punched the accused's bedroom door a number of times, causing minor injuries to his hands. He also head- butted the wall. According to DW, the accused seemed to be scared of something. She was slurring her words. He said that she told him that something was after her. The accused went to the kitchen where she sat on the floor before lapsing into a state of unconsciousness. DW contacted emergency services and an ambulance officer arrived shortly afterwards. He examined BM and formed the view that he had been dead for some hours. The accused was conveyed under police guard to Wyong Hospital in an unconscious state. 

20A large number of empty blister packs of various prescription medications were located in the kitchen waste bin. These packs were collected by ambulance officers and taken to Wyong Hospital to assist with the treatment of the accused. A blood sample taken from the accused at 11.00 pm revealed the presence of codeine, alprazolam, promethazine and mirtazapine . A urine toxicological screen indicated a positive result for benzodiazepines and opiates. Dr Judith Perl, forensic pharmacologist, expressed the opinion that: 

In summary, there does not appear to be any indication of an overdose resulting in life-threatening effects of any particular medication used by [RM]. However, there is an indication that her higher than expected blood levels were due to higher than prescribed doses of mirtazapine and alprazolam having been used. This would have resulted in some of the symptoms observed in her after the incident and these suggest impairment of her cognitive and motor functions due to the sedative nature of these drugs. Some symptoms also appear to be due to her mental illness, but I cannot elaborate further on this area as it is not my field of expertise. 

21When the accused became coherent, police spoke with her at the hospital at 8.10am on 25 August. The accused was informed that she was under arrest and was cautioned. She remained under police guard until a medical and psychiatric release could be obtained . 

22Shortly after 1 pm that afternoon, police investigators attended the hospital after being informed that the accused was cleared for release pending a psychiatric evaluation. Upon their arrival, police were given an evaluation of the accused which had been conducted by a psychiatrist and two psychiatric registrars. During the course of the evaluation the accused said that she had suffocated BM. She had then written a note and blessed the child before taking an overdose of medication. She said that she wanted to die and that she expected to do so from the overdose. She said, ""Absolutely, it was wrong....I'm the one who fucked up everything and killed my son"". She was tearful and expressed remorse. During the evaluation she reported a four year history of delusions, perceptual disturbances and passivity phenomena. She said that she believed that ""reptilians"" had come to earth from space, mocking her and giving her commands to kill herself and that she was being controlled by them. She explained that this phenomenon had developed over the previous three months and that she had become increasingly worried about her son's safety. She said that she thought that her son would be safer from the ""reptilians"" in heaven. 

23During the evaluation the accused appeared to dissociate for brief periods of time. She reported seeing and hearing ""reptilians"" and experiencing physical sensations when they were near. In their joint report, the consultant psychiatrist and the two psychiatric registrars opined that the accused was mentally ill. They said that she presented with a psychotic illness, which was most probably related to paranoid schizophrenia. She also had a co-morbid Major Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Upon being placed under arrest the accused told detectives, that ""I deserve to be punished for what I've done"". The accused was conveyed to The Entrance Police Station and after being entered into custody, she agreed to be interviewed. During the interview the accused told police that she had killed her son because she did not want him to suffer in this world. She also said ""I've got nothing to hide. I'm guilty."" When asked why she was protecting her son, she said ""Please, I don't want to go there, I can't talk about it any more"". Her answers were lucid and concise although she did state that her son was a product of an immaculate conception and that his father was God. 

24She told police that she had ingested about a half a handful of her medication which included Avanza (an antidepressant) and Xanax (for anxiety). She then became distressed and declined to be interviewed any further. In a subsequent unrecorded interview with police, the accused admitted suffocating BM by using her hands and two white face washers whilst he was on the lounge room floor. Two face washers were found on a cabinet next to the entrance to the lounge room. There is no suggestion that the accused harmed the child in any way prior to this event. 

25The accused, who has no prior criminal history, has remained in custody since her arrest. On 23 June 2010 she waived her right to a committal hearing and was committed to this Court for arraignment. 

The psychiatric evidence concerning the accused's mental condition 

26Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a report, dated 28 October 2009, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of schizophrenia in the form of auditory hallucinations of several years' duration, giving rise to bizarre delusional beliefs. [RM's] presentation was also typical of a person with an undertreated schizophrenic illness in that she had a very blunted emotional range, appeared distracted as though experiencing auditory hallucinations during the interview, expressed the bizarre belief that I would be in danger if she disclosed the presence of symptoms to me. 

There was characteristic ambivalence in her attitude to her symptoms in that she agreed that her training should have enabled her to consider the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but also seemed compelled to obey the voices and to hold the belief that her son was better off dead because of the fate that he would have faced had she not killed him. 

[RM's] depressive illness appears to be secondary to the effect of very distressing psychotic symptoms, rather than her psychotic symptoms being a manifestation of severe depression. 

Consideration was given to the possibility that [RM] had drawn on her experience as a psychologist working in community mental health to fabricate her symptoms. However, her account of symptoms was thought to be consistent with the presence of severe mental illness and I expect the medical records from James Fletcher Hospital and other corroborative information will confirm the pattern of symptoms. 

There was no history of brain injury or substance abuse. 

Based on the information available and her presentation at the recent interview, I believe [RM] has the defence of mental illness open to her. She has a severe psychotic illness, probably schizophrenia, that gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the bizarre delusional belief that she and her son were in danger of a tormenting death in the hands of Alien creatures. 

Her illness did not deprive her of the knowledge of the nature or quality of her act which is reflected in her statements to the police afterwards or that the act was illegal. The effect of delusional beliefs arising from ongoing symptoms was to deprive her of the knowledge that killing her son was morally wrong. 

27Dr Richard Furst also prepared a report, dated 20 June 2010, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

There is well established history of anxiety with panic attacks for which she has been treated over several years with antidepressant medication and Xanax. 

Her clinical history is highly suggestive of a severe disturbance of mood in the form of a Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic symptoms, however the persistence of her delusional beliefs about aliens and various other psychotic phenomena over the last nine months now makes it more likely that she is suffering from a major psychotic illness best classified as Schizoaffective Disorder. She may also have an underlying personality disorder with Borderline features. ... 

In the case of [RM], she was suffering from a psychotic illness at the time in question that was characterised by multiple experiences of hearing and seeing alien figures she called 'reptilians' who she took to be an evil and dark presence over her house. She described increased worry and panic attacks in the period preceding the index offence, felt down and saw an alien ship blocking out the sun. She remembers that it was ""really dark"" and that she experienced nightmares. She told me that she would walk from one room of the house to another and that ""it was like it had been taken over by darkness...it looked darker."" She thought that this dark presence was due to the Reptilians and burnt incense and candle to try and get rid of them. 

She believed that both she and [BM] were being overcome by the reptilians, in that [BM] had changed his appearance, including his facial features and his eye colour. This description is consistent with a Capgras delusion (delusion of imposters), which reinforced her belief that the Reptilians were sucking his soul out and changing him into something else she referred to as a 'Changeling'. It is highly likely that she was panicking about [BM's] safety, as she heard the 'Reptilians' making hissing noises saying ""we're going to get him"". 

Although she could not recall killing [BM] when I interviewed her, there was a verbatim account of a highly emotional, thought disordered and psychotic nature on the morning after the index offence that is outlined in the statements of Dr Minoka Galappaththi and Dr Pashu that included the following exchanges: 

Dr Pashu: Who is [BM]? The accused: ""My son [BM...17 months old...over and over they told me that I need to kill [BM]...he needed to go to heaven."" 
Dr Pashu...What happened to [BM]? 
The accused: ""They are coming and going...'just kill the child and kill yourself'...that's the only way to end the suffering ""I killed him...suffocated him...I think it was the last evening'...I just can't see how I could have done it...may be it's wrong."" 

These responses indicate that [RM] was aware of her actions at the time in question and felt compelled to do this because she was being commanded to by the 'reptilians' and saw no real alternative to end her suffering and the suffering and attack she perceived [BM] to be under. Her act of placing a note on her son's 
body that said ""I am sorry I had to protect [BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me"" also illustrates her mens rea at the time in question, which led to her killing [BM] and trying to kill herself. 

Although the question of her mental illness at the time of the index offence is a matter for the trier of fact, she was clearly delusional about the victim, perceiving that he was under attack from the reptilians and that his soul was in danger. It is highly likely that her delusions were a product of her schizoaffective disorder, an illness that has been recognised in law as a disease of the mind. In my opinion, her psychotic symptoms deprived her of the ability to appreciate the moral wrongfulness of her actions in killing [BM] and stopped her from reasoning about her actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure. I believe that she has the mental illness defence open to her. 

28Dr Allnutt prepared a report, dated 2 November 2010, at the request of the Crown's legal representatives. He concluded: 

I am however more inclined to accept that she suffered panic attacks for many years and that in the material time leading up to the alleged offences, she was likely suffering depressive symptoms; and as a result , despite my misgivings, I am prepared to conclude that she suffered from, what in legal terms could be regarded as ""disease of the mind"" or an ""underlying condition"", due to a depression and anxiety. ... 

If the court accepts that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence - that is, that she rationalised that she should kill the child because it was in his interest and that she acted with delusional justification - the court could conclude that she was incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of her actions and that she has a mental illness defence because she would have been significantly compromised in that capacity. 

If the court does not accept that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence, but accepts she was suffering a depression with anxiety, then there are grounds to consider that she was to some lesser degree compromised in her capacity to know the wrongfulness of her actions and the (sic) could consider a defence of mental illness. 

29After having been provided with further material Dr Allnutt observed, in a subsequent report, dated 28 March 2011: 

Having regard to that ""timeline"", there is evidence of interest in crystals, Reiki, subliminal messages, commencing October 1987, with evidence of anxiety in the early 1990s and continuing; there appear to be changes occurring in her behaviour in early 2006...it is noted that she started saying ""weird stuff"" like she could see dead people, communicate them (sic), help people transition through death, that she communicates telepathically with a friend and a cat, and sees signs in things like number plates. 

These are symptoms that are consistent with psychosis that seem to emerge at a time where there is little evidence for underlying motive for fabrication or exaggeration, and I regard this as significant. 

While I continue to believe that her presentation is atypical, I accept that it is likely that she suffered psychosis at the material time that the alleged offence (sic). 

My opinion in regard to the defence available to her is explained in my report; that is, depending on how the court interprets the evidence she would be eligible for a defence of mental illness or substantial impairment. 

30To establish the defence of mental illness the accused must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time of the killing she was suffering from such a defect of reasoning arising from a disease of the mind that she did not know the nature and quality of what she was doing, or alternatively if she did know it, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong (the M'Naghten test). It is the second limb of that test which is of particular significance in the present case. That requirement was described in the following terms by Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182: 

The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. (at 189-90) 

See also Stapleton v R (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367. 

31It is to be observed that the opinions of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, particularly in those passages to which I have referred, are directed to the test which I am bound to apply. In light of the evidence which I have set out, which includes the various utterances and actions of the accused at the relevant time, as well as her lengthy history of mental illness, I have no hesitation in accepting the opinions of those experts, each of whom is eminently qualified in the area of forensic psychiatry. 

32I accept the submission made by each of the parties that the accused has established upon the balance of probabilities that she did not know, in the relevant sense, that what she was doing was wrong, and that therefore she was mentally ill at the time she killed the deceased. It is axiomatic that a person who is found to be mentally ill cannot be held criminally responsible for his or her actions. 

Order 

33In accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) I find the accused not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness. In doing so I have had regard, pursuant to s 37 of the Act, to the practical and legal consequences of that finding. See R v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 per Hall J [at para 69-79]. I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Act, in the custody of Corrective Services NSW until released by due process of law. The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by the court. I direct that the various reports of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and of Dr Allnutt be drawn to the attention of Justice Health. 

34Finally, I would like to take the opportunity of extending my sympathy to the family of the deceased, who undoubtedly have been deeply affected by this tragic event.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  Introduction

  1                     Arthur Winston Crane is a member of the Senate of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.  In December 1998, his Parliamentary and Electorate offices and his home were searched pursuant to search warrants issued under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  The warrants were issued in aid of an investigation into payments made in respect of charter flights taken by Senator Crane between 1995 and 1998.  Senator Crane brought to the Court what was initially a challenge to the validity of the warrants and a claim for parliamentary privilege in respect of documents seized.  The challenge to the validity of the warrants was abandoned.  However he now seeks a declaration as to his entitlement to the payments made in respect of charter services used.  He also maintains his claim for parliamentary privilege in respect of certain of the documents seized from his Parliamentary and Electorate offices.  The claim is not maintained in respect of the bulk of the documents seized which were released to the Australian Federal Police at the time of the hearing to enable them to continue their investigation.

  2                     The case raises important issues concerning the proper role of the Court in dealing with allegations of criminal conduct in the context of civil proceedings and the proper role of the Court in determining questions of parliamentary privilege which arise between the Executive and the Parliament and not in the course of judicial proceedings.

  Factual Background

  3                     On 18 December 1998, at Perth, Ronald John Gething, a Stipendiary Magistrate issued two search warrants pursuant to s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914.  The warrants related to the home and the electorate office of Arthur Winston Crane, a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament.  Senator Crane’s home address referred to in the relevant warrant is Oldfield Location 800 (located at the intersection of Fence Road and Jerdacuttup North Road, Jerdacuttup).  The electorate office is 890 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park.  Each warrant authorised the officer to whom it was issued to enter and search the premises described, to search for and record finger prints found at the premises, take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes and to search the premises for any evidential material that satisfied all of three conditions specified in the warrant and to seize any such evidential material that might be found.  The warrant also authorised the executing officer to:

  “- seize any other thing found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or the constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:

  - evidential material in relation to an offence to which this warrant relates; or

              - anything that is relevant to another offence that is an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth in that it is evidential material in relation to that offence;

  if the executing officer or the constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence;”

  The three conditions referred to were in the following terms:

              . Unit 1, Number 97 Ashburton Street, East Victoria Park, Western Australia

  THIRD CONDITION

  Things as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the commission of the following offence(s) against the laws of the Commonwealth:

  1.         That between 28 December 1994 and 14 July 1996 Arthur Winston Crane imposed upon the Commonwealth contrary to Section 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 by an untrue representation in that he forwarded to the (then) Department of Administrative Services (DAS), invoices showing air charter flights  between Perth and places in rural Western Australia with the view to obtaining a benefit, namely payment for charter flights between Perth-Ravensthorpe, Western Australia-Perth.

              And as an example that:

              A.         On the 26 April 1995 Arthur Winston Crane imposed upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation, in that he forwarded to DAS an invoice for air charter travel between Perth-Kalgoorlie Western Australia-Perth to the value of $1118.  In doing so Mr Crane received the benefit of an air charter flight between Perth-Ravensthorpe-Perth.

              B.         On the 4June 1995 Arthur Winston Crane imposed upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation, in that he forwarded to DAS an invoice for air charter travel between Perth-Mullewa, Western Australia-Perth to the value of $1248.  In doing so Mr Crane received the benefit of an air charter flight between Perth-Ravensthorpe-Perth.

              C.        On the 14 July 1996 Arthur Winston Crane imposed upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation, in that he forwarded to DAS an invoice for air charter travel between Perth-Albany, Western Australia-Perth to the value of $1521.  In doing so Mr Crane received the benefit of an air charter flight between Perth-Ravensthorpe-Perth.

  2.         That between 28 December 1994 and 14 July 1996, person or persons unknown from R.P.M. Management Pty Ltd trading as AD-Astral Aviation were knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence by Arthur Winston Crane, to wit imposing upon the Commonwealth contrary to Section 29B of the Crimes Act 1914.

  3.         That between the 14 July 1996 and the 3 October 1998 Arthur Winston Crane imposed upon the Commonwealth contrary to Section 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 by an untrue representation in that he forwarded to DAS and DoFA invoices showing air charter flights between Perth and places in rural Western Australia with the view to obtaining a benefit namely payment for charter flights between Perth-Ravensthorpe, Western Australia-Perth.

  4.         That between the 14 July 1996 and the 3 October 1998, person or persons unknown from R.P.M. Management Pty Ltd trading as AD-Astral Aviation were knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence by Arthur Winston Crane, to wit imposing upon the Commonwealth contrary to Section 29B of the Crimes Act 1914.”

  A third warrant issued on 17 December 1998 in Canberra was directed to premises described as:

  “The Parliamentary Office of Senator Arthur Winston Crane located at the Senate Wing, Ground Floor, Suite 117, Parliament House, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.”

  The issuing officer was Phillip Raymond Thompson, a Stipendiary Magistrate.  The terms of the warrant were virtually identical to those of the two warrants issued in Western Australia. 

  4                     The warrants were executed at or about the dates of their issue.  A quantity of documents was seized from each of the premises.  Senator Crane made contact with the Clerk of the Senate who wrote to him on 21 December 1998 confirming oral advice which he had given telephonically in relation to the question of parliamentary privilege.  In his letter the Clerk of the Senate indicated that he had been advised by the Australian Federal Police that material taken from “your office” – evidently a reference to both the Parliamentary office and the Electorate office – had been placed in sealed containers and delivered to the Registrar of the Supreme Court in Canberra and the issuing magistrate in Perth.  The Clerk of the Senate advised Senator Crane that he had three options for determining whether any of the material was the subject of parliamentary privilege:

  1.         To allow the police to have access to the material, wait to see whether any of it is proposed to be used in any legal proceedings and then contest the use of it in those legal proceedings in the court in which they are to take place.

  2.         Bring an action in a court to seek a judgment that all or some of the material is protected by parliamentary privilege and therefore immune from seizure.

  3.         Agree with the Australian Federal Police to the procedure whereby a neutral third party examine the material and determine whether any of it is the subject of parliamentary privilege.

   

  A description of material apparently seized from the Parliamentary office was attached to the letter.  It was as follows:

  1.         Document entitled “Extract from the Remuneration Tribunal 1989 Review”.

  2.         Document described as “Page 2 of a telephone message Tuesday, 11 November”.

  3.         Two x Verbatim brand backup tapes, one titled “Julie Canberra 22/5/98”, and one titled “CBR”.

  4.         Three Sony Magnets Optical Disks (AFP) containing images of hard disk drive of computers in Senator Crane’s suite, Parliament House.

  5                     On 22 December Senator Crane’s solicitors wrote to the Australian Federal Police and in particular to Officer Girling, who was named as the relevant officer in one of the warrants issued by Mr Gething.  The letter referred to a claim of parliamentary privilege having been “recognised in respect of documents located at our client’s parliamentary office and the same are now in the custody of the President of the Senate”.  The letter raised the question of the grounds upon which the warrant had issued and sought particulars of those grounds so far as they related to alleged offences.  The Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions responded to that letter observing that when the warrant was executed Senator Crane had claimed parliamentary privilege over all seized documents.  The executing officers had followed a protocol in accordance with guidelines agreed between the Australian Federal Police and the Law Council of Australia as to execution of warrants on lawyers’ premises where a claim of legal professional privilege is made.  Senator Crane was invited to enforce his claim for parliamentary privilege in the appropriate forum.  His lawyers were advised that should such action be not taken by Monday, 18 January the seized documents would be recovered by the Australian Federal Police and treated as if a claim for parliamentary privilege had not been made.  The request for particulars of the charges was denied.

  6                     On 28 January 1999 an application was filed in the Western Australia District Registry of this Court whereby Senator Crane, naming as respondents, the Magistrate at the Court of Petty Sessions held at Perth, the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Commissioner of Australian Federal Police, sought judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 (Cth).  The decision for which he sought review was that of the Magistrate at Perth “…to grant search warrants…to Scott Horace Girling and Others of the Australian Federal Police to conduct a search of the residence of the applicant at Ravensthorpe and of the premises at 890 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park, Western Australia being the electorate office of the applicant who is a Senator for the State of Western Australia.”

  7                     The application set out various grounds for review which were in the following terms:

  “1.       The Warrants are imprecise as to time (date of creation of documents), scope, and description of the things searched for;

  2.         The things to be searched for are ambiguous;

  3.         The alleged offences which have grounded the Warrants are imprecise and the Second Respondent has refused to supply particulars thereof;

  4.         The Warrants amount to a general warrant.”

  Relief claimed in the application was by way of order that the warrants be set aside.

  8                     The proceedings came on for directions before Nicholson J on 4 February 1999 and leave was given to Senator Crane to issue further proceedings or to amend the existing proceedings to enjoin a challenge to the warrant issued in Canberra.  He was also required to file an affidavit within fourteen days deposing to facts and circumstances providing the grounds and identifying which, if any, documents were subject to a claim for parliamentary privilege.

  9                     At a further directions hearing on 9 March 1999 orders were made removing the Director of Public Prosecutions as second respondent and joining the Magistrate’s Court of the Australian Capital Territory at Canberra as second respondent.  Senator Crane was given leave to amend the proceedings in terms of a minute of proposed substituted application.  It was also directed that a copy of all process filed to date be served by the District Registrar on the Clerk of the Senate so the Senate could determine whether it wished to appear or make submissions by counsel on any matter concerning the claim for alleged privilege or the procedure which the Court should follow in determining a disputed claim of privilege.  On 18 May 1999 the application was further amended by a new amended substituted application and statement of claim.  Directions were made for the filing of affidavits and the directions hearing was otherwise adjourned to a date to be fixed. 

  10                  On 26 July 1999 further directions were made changing the designation of the first and second respondents to Ronald John Gething and Philip Raymond Thompson respectively.  The Clerk of the Perth Court of Petty Sessions was to produce to the District Registrar of the Federal Court all documents held by him at the request of the applicant and the third respondent which had been seized by the third respondent pursuant to search warrants executed on Senator Crane’s premises.  The Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory was requested to produce to the District Registrar of the Federal Court in Perth all documents held by the Supreme Court Registrar at the request of Senator Crane and the third respondent.

  The Amended Application and Statement of Claim

  11                  The amended application as it stood at the hearing of these proceedings sought declarations that each of the warrants was invalid on somewhat expanded grounds  going to the ambiguity, want of precision and particularity in various respects and the “impossibility” for those reasons of making a claim for parliamentary privilege on any item which the police might seek to seize.  In addition to the declarations as to invalidity of the warrants, the application also sought:

  “2.       An order that the Warrants in each instance be set aside;

  3.         An order that documents seized pursuant to the Warrants be returned to the place from which they were seized;

  4.         A declaration that the Applicant was entitled to be paid an allowance by the Commonwealth for each of the Charter Flights;

  5.         Such further or other orders as the Court shall think fit;

  6.         Costs.”

  12                  By the amended substituted statement of claim Senator Crane raises questions relevant only to the claim for a declaration that he was entitled to be paid an allowance by the Commonwealth for each of the charter flights referred to in the warrants.  It is pleaded that he was at all material times entitled, pursuant to s 4 of the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 (as amended), to the Salary and Allowances to be paid to him from the Public Moneys of the Commonwealth:

  “(i)      prescribed in section 48 of the Constitution, and;

  (ii)       determined from time to time by the Remuneration Tribunal pursuant to subsections 7(1) and (4) of Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 (as amended).”

   The statement of claim then goes on to refer to determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal relating to reimbursement of members of the Commonwealth parliament for the use of charter transport, including the charter of aircraft.  It is said that pursuant to these determinations for each of specified charter flights listed in a schedule to the statement of claim Senator Crane claimed and was provided an allowance by the Commonwealth.  Each of the flights, it is said, was reasonable in the circumstances and within and for the service of the electorate.  So Senator Crane says he was entitled to be paid an allowance by the Commonwealth for each of the charter flights under the Remuneration Tribunal determinations and on that basis seeks the relevant declaration.

  13                  By way of defence, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police does not admit the entitlement to be paid, says that he and his officers are presently engaged in an investigation into the very question of whether or not the applicant was entitled to be paid the allowances as alleged and if not, whether he may have committed an offence against the law of the Commonwealth.  The Commissioner asserts that the search warrants, the subject of these proceedings, have been issued and are to be executed in pursuance of that investigation.  He says it will not be possible for him to reach a decision about whether or not there was an entitlement to payment for any or all of the charter flights until the investigation has been completed, including the execution of the warrants and the consideration of material evidence, if any, obtained as a result of that execution.  He does not admit that each of the charter flights was reasonable or within and for the service of the electorate and says he will not be in a position to address that contention without first completing the investigation.  As to the general claim of entitlement made in the statement of claim, the Commissioner says it is premature to adjudicate upon or attempt to determine it in these or other proceedings until the investigation presently being conducted has been completed and contends, as a matter of law, that this Court should decline to grant declaratory relief on the question presently under investigation which could possibly lead to the laying of criminal charges in due course.

  The Trial of the Action

  14                  Upon the hearing of the application, the attack upon the validity of the warrants was abandoned.   There were two issues remaining before the Court.  The first was raised by Senator Crane’s contention that he was entitled to the payments the subject of the investigation in aid of which the warrants were issued.  The second, albeit not formally raised on the amended application or the statement of claim, was whether and to what extent parliamentary privilege attached to certain documents seized from his Parliamentary and Electorate offices.  The claim for privilege was not maintained in relation to the great bulk of documents seized and orders were made by consent releasing those documents to the third respondent so that the investigation could continue.

  Statutory Framework Relating to Search Warrants and Imposition

  15                  Search warrants, in respect of suspected offences against laws of the Commonwealth, can be issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914.  The power to issue is conferred by subs 3E(1):

  “An issuing officer may issue a warrant to search premises if the officer is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.”

  Subsections 3E(5) and 3E(6) prescribe respectively what must be set out in all search warrants and what must be set out  in warrants relating to premises.  The things authorised by a search warrant, including entry on to premise and the search for and seizure of evidential material, are set out in s 3F.  Various ancillary powers, not relevant for present purposes, are set out in ss 3G to 3L respectively.  The occupier of the premises being searched, if present, must be given a copy of the warrant (s 3H).  “Evidential material” is defined in s 3C(1) as:

  ““evidential Material” means a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form;”

  That section also defines “offence” as follows:

  ““offence” means:

  (a)       an offence against a law of the Commonwealth (other than the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982); or

  (b)       an offence against a law of a Territory other than the Australian Capital Territory.”

  The term “issuing officer” in relation to a warrant to search premises means:

  “(a)     a magistrate; or

  (b)       a justice of the peace or other person employed in a court of State or Territory who is authorised to issue search warrants or warrants for arrest, as the case may be.”

  16                  Section 29B of the Crimes Act which is referred to in the warrants is in the following terms:

  “29B.  Any person who imposes or endeavours to impose upon the Commonwealth or any public authority under the Commonwealth by any untrue representation, made in any manner whatsoever, with a view to obtaining money or any other benefit or advantage, shall be guilty of an offence.”

  17                  The question of parliamentary privilege is regulated by the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth) which is referred to in more detail later in these reasons. 

  Claim of Entitlement

  18                  In support of a contention that he was entitled to the payments and benefits which are the subject of investigation, Senator Crane filed an affidavit in which he described the system of determining and administering allowances for charter aircraft hire for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.  The scheme of allowances is established by the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952.  Annual entitlements are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.  Senator Crane relied upon a determination of the Tribunal, No 17 of 1989, made pursuant to s 7(4)(a) and (b) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.  The relevant parts of the determination were as follows:

  “TRAVEL ENTITLEMENTS – SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT

  Senators and Members

  1.1  A senator or member when travelling within Australia on parliamentary or electorate business (but excluding party business) shall be entitled to travel at government expense on scheduled commercial/commuter air services, main line rail services or by motor coach and other vehicles operating as regular carriers.

  .

  .

  .

  CHARTER AIRCRAFT/DRIVE YOURSELF VEHICLES

  5.1  “Charter transport” includes charter aircraft and such other modes of transport as may be reasonable in the circumstances within and for the service of the electorate.  This entitlement does not extend to the use of taxis or hire cars in the metropolitan areas of capital cities or to the use by any person other than the senator or member  except when another senator or member or the spouse or member of the staff of the senator or member is accompanying the senator or member.

  5.2  A senator or member to whom one of the following criteria applies shall be entitled, at government expense, to use charter transport within and for the service of his or her State, Territory or electorate to the limit specified:-

  (a)       Senator                                    Maximum Reimbursement per annum

  .

  .

  .

  (ii)       representing Queensland

              or Western Australia               $12,363

  .

  .

  .

  5.3  A senator or member entitled by this determination to use charter transport within and for the service of their electorate, State or Territory shall be entitled to engage or dismiss the charter transport at a place outside his or her electorate, State or Territory adjacent to the point of departure or destination.

  5.4  The Minister for Administrative Services shall have a discretion to approve the use of charter aircraft within Australia at government expense in special cases, other than for the service of the electorate, including such use by the Leader of a recognised party of at least 5 members and circumstances where a senator or member would be unduly delayed by the use of scheduled services.”

  19                  Senator Crane resides at Jerdacuttup which is about 60 kilometres south east of Ravensthorpe by road and 150 kilometres west of Esperance.  Since his election in 1990 he has experienced difficulties in travel arrangements between his home and Perth and Canberra which are related to the distance from his home to Esperance airport and the scheduling of flights out of that airport.  Following discussions which he had in 1993 with the then Minister for Finance and Administrative Services, Senator Crane formed the view that he was entitled to make use of his charter aircraft allowance for the purpose of travel between Perth and his home at Jerdacuttup where there was no reasonable alternative commercial flight.  This was for travel to Perth for the purpose of carrying out his duties as a senator which included parliamentary and electoral work.  According to his affidavit evidence, charter invoices raised in respect of such flights were paid by the Department of Administrative Services on presentation.  According to Senator Crane, his entitlement was confirmed by the new Minister for Administrative Services in 1996. 

  20                  In his affidavit Senator Crane set out a list of the charter flights he took between 25 December 1994 and 8 December 1995, each of which ran between Ravensthorpe and Perth and was said to be for the purpose of attending electorate office business and, in some cases, to connect with travel between Perth and Canberra.

  21                  What all this amounted to was the contention that all of the charter travel taken at the expense of the Commonwealth between December 1994 and December 1995 was within Senator Crane’s entitlement. The question is, assuming that the entitlement could be made out, is Senator Crane able to seek a declaration to that effect and thus in a practical although not legal sense, pre-empt the ongoing police investigation.

  A Declaration of Innocence

  22                  Senator Crane’s desire to obtain a declaration from this Court of his entitlement to receive the charter allowances under investigation is understandable.  It is a fact of public life today that the making of an accusation or the initiation of an investigation is enough in the minds of some to seal the fate and reputation of the person under investigation.  The general question which must be answered in the circumstances of this particular case is whether this Court can and should accede to an application for declaratory relief on an issue of fact where there are no pending proceedings but an investigative process into those issues has been initiated.

  23                  Courts from time to time grant declaratory relief and other remedies by way of judicial review in relation to matters which are or could be the subject of criminal proceedings.  Applications for such relief usually face a substantial threshold the extent of which depends upon whether they concern matters involving past or future conduct and according to whether there are proceedings arising out of the conduct in question, pending in a criminal court:

   “… the civil courts are reluctant to grant declaratory relief when this involves determining whether particular conduct amounts to a crime because the grant of a declaration could result in conflict between the civil and criminal courts, with the civil courts usurping the proper role of the criminal courts.” –  De Smith Woolf and Jowell - Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell, 1995)

   

  Nevertheless, as Aronson and Dyer say in Judicial Review of Administrative Action (LBC 1996) at 886:

  “However, the generalised judicial expressions of reluctance to use the declaration in the area of criminal law ought to be read and applied in context.  One should always ask questions such as: Who is bringing these proceedings; the accuser, the accused or a stranger?  Are the criminal courts presently seised of the matter? Are they better equipped to deal with it?  Would it be efficient to hear this case?”

  See also Young, Declaratory Orders (2nd Edition, Butterworths (1984) pars 1701-1709 et ff) and Zamir & Woolf, The Declaratory Judgment (Sweet & Maxwell, 1993) pars 4162-4181.

  24                  The categories of case in which declarations may be sought in a civil court concerning conduct which could attract the sanctions of the criminal law include the following:

  1.         A declaration is sought in relation to past conduct and proceedings are instituted in a criminal court while the civil application is pending.

  2.         A declaration is sought in relation to past conduct while prior proceedings are pending in connection with that conduct in a court exercising criminal jurisdiction.

  3.         A declaration is sought in relation to past conduct and there is no conflict with either prior or subsequently instituted criminal proceedings.

  4.         A declaration is sought to determine whether a proposed course of conduct will contravene the criminal law.

  Each of these categories can be subdivided into categories where the question upon which the declaration is sought is a question of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

  25                  Where matters arising in civil proceedings were the subject of subsequently instituted criminal proceedings, Chancery could restrain the prosecution pending the outcome of the civil litigation – York Corporation v Pilkington (1794) 2 Atk 302 and like cases referred to in Thames Launches Ltd v Trinity House Corporation (Deptford Strond) [1961] 1 Ch 197.  In the latter case there were originating summonses pending in the Chancery Division of the High Court which involved the construction of the Pilotage Act 1913. The defendants were restrained from proceeding against the plaintiff on prosecutions subsequently commenced in the Magistrates Court alleging the commission of offences under the Act and raising substantially the same questions of law as were raised by the originating summonses.  Nevertheless, Buckley J accepted that jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief in such a case was to be exercised with the greatest care.  The Court would be slow to interfere with the course of criminal proceedings unless it was clear that the civil proceedings and the criminal proceedings were really about the same issue and that if the civil proceedings succeeded the criminal proceedings must necessarily fail (at 204). 

  26                  Declaratory relief impinging on criminal proceedings already commenced will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.  As Gibbs ACJ said in Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 26:

  “…a court will be reluctant to make declarations in a matter which impinges directly upon the course of proceedings in a criminal matter.  Once criminal proceedings have begun they should be allowed to follow their ordinary course unless it appears that for some special reason it is necessary in the interests of justice to make a declaratory order.”

  There were exceptional reasons to warrant the granting of a declaratory order in that case which turned on a question of law crucial to the private prosecution then pending by way of committal proceeding in the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory.  But the caution against the grant of declaratory relief where criminal proceedings have been properly instituted was reinforced by the House of Lords in Imperial Tobacco Ltd v Attorney General [1981] AC 718.  Viscount Dilhorne put it succinctly at 741:

  “I think that the administration of justice would become chaotic if, after the start of a prosecution, declarations of innocence could be obtained from a civil court.”

  See also at 746 (Lord Fraser and Lord Scarman) and at 752 (Lord Lane).

  27                  There is a distinction to be drawn between the case in which declaratory relief is sought in relation to past conduct, whether or not the subject of pending criminal proceedings and that in which declaratory relief is sought in relation to proposed or apprehended conduct – Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Sansom [1981] WAR 32 at 36 (Burt CJ).  Reservations have been expressed even in the latter category of case.  But it has been accepted that the capacity of courts to declare that conduct which has not yet taken place will not be in breach of a contract or a law “contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction” – Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Limited (1972) 126 CLR 297 at 305 (Barwick CJ).  This is notwithstanding, as Menzies J observed (McTiernan J agreeing) that the court, in exercising its discretion, would “take into account in an appropriate case, the principle that, in general, matters of criminal law should be dealt with at trial for alleged offences” (at 311).   Viscount Dilhorne in Imperial Tobacco  could “well see the advantages of persons being able to obtain rulings on whether or not certain conduct on which they proposed to embark will be criminal” although he observed that “it may be a defect in our present system that it does not provide for that” (at 741).  But the system does so provide to some extent.  In Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom v Department of Health and Social Security [1981] AC 800, a declaration was granted that departmental advice relating to termination of pregnancy by medical induction did not involve the commission by hospital staff implementing it of any offence against the Abortion Act 1967.  There was, no discussion in the House of Lords, of the desirability of the relief sought.  It was accepted sub silentio.  There was such discussion in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993] AC 789 in which a declaration was sought that the Trust and attending responsible physicians could lawfully discontinue life sustaining treatment and medical support for a young patient in a permanent vegetative state resulting from injuries sustained in a sporting accident three and a half years previously.  Lord Goff recognised “that strong warnings have been given against the civil courts usurping the function of the criminal courts” and referred to statements in the Imperial Tobacco case that a declaration as to the lawfulness or otherwise of future conduct would be “no bar to a criminal prosecution, no matter the authority of the court which grants it”.  The jurisdiction existed to grant such a declaration and it would be a deplorable state of affairs if no authoritative guidance could be given to the medical profession in a case such as that before the court (at 862).  See also Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 880, Lord Mustill at 888.

  28                  Attempts to establish by declaration, other than upon the application of the Attorney General or statutory regulators, that past conduct amounts to a criminal offence have been given short shrift – Inglis v Moore (1979) 24 ALR 411 at 414 (St John J) and 421 (Brennan and Davies JJ).  See also Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers [1978] AC 435; Attorney-General v Able [1984] QB 795.

  29                  In matters relating to the regulation of corporate behaviour, applications for such relief have been entertained at the instance of the Attorney-General or the regulator – Attorney-General (NSW) v Australian Fixed Trusts Ltd [1974] 1 NSWLR 110; Corporate Affairs Commission v MG Securities (Australasia) Limited (1975) 1 ACLR 157.  In the latter case, Reynolds JA (Moffitt P agreeing) expressed reservations as to whether any declaration should be made noting that:

  “…the utility thereof by way of res judicata or otherwise would be open to question and it might do no more than embarrass the parties if a prosecution were launched.” (at 163)

  Mahoney JA described the procedure as “a beneficial one and .. apt for cases such as the present” (at 178).  Each case will turn on its own circumstances.  So in Biggs v DPP (1997) 17 WAR 534 a declaration was made in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia that a verdict of acquittal given by a jury in the District Court entitled the accused to plead autrefois acquit in subsequent proceedings for the same offences even though the trial judge in the District Court had set aside the verdict on the basis of answers to questions she put to the jury after it had been delivered.  Kennedy J accepted that while the jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief in relation to criminal proceedings can only be exercised in exceptional cases, it does exist.  The case before the Full Court was one in which it was desirable to determine the questions raised.  The grant of relief would not interrupt any criminal proceedings and could obviate the need for a new trial if the plea autrefois acquit were otherwise to fail in light of the ruling of the judge at first instance (at 544).

  30                  Other circumstances in which civil proceedings especially by way of judicial review have involved suspected criminal behaviour as their subject matter, include applications for review of committal decisions for federal offences and applications challenging the validity of the issue of search warrants or telephonic interception warrants and the like.  In both categories of case relief, including declaratory relief, may be available but only in exceptional circumstances.  As to committal proceedings see Kunakool v Boys (1987) 14 FCR 489 at 498-499 and the cases reviewed therein.  In Flanagan v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 60 FCR 149, the Full Court referred to the well established principle that:

  “…criminal proceedings should not be fragmented by other courts’ entertaining, except in exceptional or extraordinary circumstances, applications of various kinds by or against one or more of the participants in the criminal trial.” (at 187)

   

  If, however, a claim for relief involves a precise question of law emerging from a context of undisputed fact, especially a question the resolution of which may clarify the law for other cases, then prima facie there is much to be said in favour of courts hearing and determining such a claim (at 188).  Where the facts are few and simple and the point is one of law, a claim may as an exception to the fragmentation principle be entertained on an application for judicial review (at 188).

  31                  What emerges from the case law generally is a spectrum of responses to claims for declaratory or consequential relief where such relief is based upon the proposition that the conduct at issue is or is not a contravention of the criminal law.  At one end of the spectrum is the case involving a claim for a declaration based upon undisputed facts and a question of law such as the construction or validity of a statute or delegated legislation or a statutory instrument.  Where there are no pending criminal proceedings the probability of such a claim being entertained is at its highest, albeit subject to discretion informed by the well-established reluctance of civil courts to enter into criminal jurisdiction.  Where a prosecution is pending the prospect of obtaining relief is less.  Where the claim is sought during a trial the prospect of obtaining relief are probably negligible.  Where the claim is made after a trial it will ordinarily be seen as subverting established appeal processes albeit it may be entertained in exceptional circumstances – Biggs v DPP (supra).

  32                  Where, as in this case, a claim for relief is made after an investigation has commenced and collateral to an attack on a search warrant issued in connection with that investigation and  where, as here, the claim for relief depends upon findings by the Court on the very matters of fact under investigation, the claim involves an unproductive interference with the normal processes of investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.  On the parameters generally established by the authorities already referred to, this is not a case in which the relief claimed can be entertained.  The factual matters asserted by Senator Crane in aid of his claim are not conceded by the third respondent.  Nor could they be, for those very matters are the subject of investigation.  In my opinion this case is well outside the range of cases in which the Court could properly entertain an application for declaratory relief.  That element of Senator Crane’s application fails.

  The Claim for Parliamentary Privilege

  33                  The issue of parliamentary privilege has not been raised with any precision in the amended substituted application except indirectly in the grounds for relief where it is asserted against the validity of the warrants that:

  “In their present form it is impossible to determine the scope of the warrants and therefore impossible to bring forward the claim for Parliamentary Privilege on any item which the police might seek to seize.”

  Nevertheless the President of the Senate, on behalf of the Senate, appeared by counsel.  The President was not joined as a respondent to these proceedings.  Counsel explained that his appearance was for a limited purpose only “to respond if necessary to any submissions that might be put in relation to a proper interpretation of the Parliamentary Privileges Act…”.   How precisely on the application before the Court it could enter upon a consideration of Senator Crane’s claim of parliamentary privilege was not at all clear.  Nevertheless I heard argument on the question.  No doubt it would be a matter which could be cured by further amendment of the claims for relief if it were open to the Court to deal with the issue at all. 

  34                  In the event, the documents in respect of which the claim for parliamentary privilege was maintained were set out in the consent order made on 6 October, which was in the following terms:

  “1.       The documents identified by the parties and contained in envelopes labelled respectively “Item No 5”, “Item No 6”, “Item No 7” and “Item No 8” be made available for inspection by the Court for the purpose of determination of a claim for parliamentary privilege.

  2.         The electronic data storage media contained in the envelope marked “Electronic Media WAG5 of 1999” be released to the third respondent’s solicitor for preparation for Court inspection by appropriate electronic means for the purpose of determination of a claim for parliamentary privilege.

  3.         The other documents held in the registry in the action be released to the third respondent.”

  35                   

  The optical disks which were the electronically stored data required decryption by a technician following the hearing of the application before they could be examined.  This took some time.

  36                  The electronically stored data seized from Senator Crane’s Parliament House office was transferred on to two CD Roms which I have inspected so far as possible using a Court laptop computer.  Some documents required the downloading of separate programs before they could be read and I have not inspected those.  Generally speaking the stored documents comprised a miscellany including records, memoranda and the like relating to the administration of the Senator’s parliamentary office.  Other contents related to constituent and interest group and other organisational communications.  Others related directly to parliamentary chamber work.  For example a draft bill was included on the disk and standard form questions of the kind which might be asked in parliamentary committee proceedings were set out in another document.  There was one document which contained in chart form, Sky West flights to and from Esperance.

  37                  The four envelopes numbered 5, 6, 7 and 8 were print outs of documents held electronically at Senator Crane’s electoral office.  They showed for each of the years 1995 to 1998 respectively detailed monthly sheets in a form of itineraries but including meetings and other functions for which written or telephoned apologies were to be tendered.  With each monthly bundle was a calendar sheet for the month showing whether Senator Crane was or was to be in Esperance, Perth or Canberra.  The running sheets plainly referred to his work as a parliamentarian with his constituents, his party organisation, special interest groups and so on.  It included the names of people with whom the Senator would be meeting from time to time. 

  38                  Both sets of documents included materials relating to the wide range of activities associated with being a Member of Parliament. 

   

  Parliamentary Privilege – Scope and Application

  39                  The constitutional base for the privileges of the Commonwealth Parliament is to be found in s 49 of the Constitution, which provides:

  “The powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and committees of each House shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.”

  From this section the Senate and House of Representatives derive the full powers, privileges and immunities of the House of Commons as at the foundation of the Commonwealth.  Those powers, privileges and immunities are not subject to restriction by implication from the constitutional separation of judicial and legislative powers.  As the High Court said in R v Richards; Ex parte Fitzpatrick and Browne (1955) 92 CLR 157 at 167:

  “…a general view of the Constitution and the separation of powers is not a sufficient reason for giving to these words, which appear to us to be so clear, a restrictive or secondary meaning which they do not properly bear.”

  The privileges and immunities of the House of Commons at the time of foundation of the Australian Federation included the freedom conferred by Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688:

  “That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of the parliament.”

  This was a parliamentary response to the prosecution of a former speaker of the House of Commons for authorising publication, as a parliamentary paper, of a libel on the Duke of York – Lock, Parliamentary Privilege and the Courts: The Avoidance of Conflict, Public Law, Spring 1985 pp 64-95.  Its immediate purpose was to provide protection for members of parliament against proceedings by the King in courts under his control for what they had said or done in proceedings in parliament – Harders, Parliamentary Privilege – Parliament versus the Court: Cross-examination of Committee Witnesses (1993) 67 ALJ 109 at 115 and references there cited.

  40                  The Australian parliament’s declaration of the powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and the House of Representatives pursuant to s 49 of the Constitution was not made until the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth).  Like the enactment of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, it was a response to a prosecution, namely that of the late High Court Judge and former Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy.  The purpose of the Bill as described by the Senate President in introducing it was:

  “To avoid the consequences of the very narrow interpretation and reading down of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 in its application to the Australian Parliament in the judgments of Mr Justice Cantor and Mr Justice Hunt in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in each trial in R v Murphy.” – Sen Deb 7/10/86 p 892

   

  The judgments referred to by the President of the Senate were rulings of Justices Cantor and Hunt, in the two trials of the late Justice Murphy, that prosecution witnesses could be cross-examined on evidence they had given in earlier Senate Select Committee proceedings. The ruling of Hunt J is reported in R v Murphy (1986) 5 NSWLR 18.  That of Cantor J, given on 5 June 1985 is unreported.  In each case the ruling was over the objection of the President of the Senate.  The parliament set up a Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege which reported, in October 1984 – Parliamentary Paper No 219-1984.  The Act gives effect to various of its recommendations.

  41                  The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 is described in its long title as:

  “An act to declare the powers, privileges and immunities of each House of the Parliament and of the members and committees of each House, and for related purposes.”

  In s 5 of the Act it is provided that:

  “Except to the extent that this Act expressly provides otherwise, the powers, privileges and immunities of each House, and of the members and committees of each House, as in force under section 49 of the Constitution immediately before the commencement of this Act, continue in force.”

  The Act therefore does not constitute an exhaustive code of parliamentary privilege. Specific provision is made in s 13 relating to unauthorised disclosure of in-camera evidence and submissions made to a House or a committee.  Section 14 provides for immunities from arrest or detention in civil causes and attendance before courts or tribunals on any day on which the House or a committee of which that person is a member meets and for a period five days before and five days after any such meeting day.  Section 16 provides for parliamentary privilege in court proceedings and is in the following terms:

  “16(1)  For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared and enacted that the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688 apply in relation to the Parliament of the Commonwealth and, as so applying, are to be taken to have, in addition to any other operation, the effect of the subsequent provisions of this section.

      (2)  For the purposes of the provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688 as applying in relation to the Parliament, and for the purposes of this section, “proceedings in Parliament” means all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes:

  (a)       the giving of evidence before a House or a committee, and evidence so given;

  (b)       the presentation or submission of a document to a House or a committee;

  (c)        the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business; and

  (d)       the formulation, making or publication of a document, including a report, by or pursuant to an order of a House or a committee and the document so formulated, made or published.

      (3)  In proceedings in any court or tribunal, it is not lawful for evidence to be tendered or received, questions asked or statements, submissions or comments made, concerning proceedings in Parliament, by way of, or for the purpose of:

  (a)       questioning or relying on the truth, motive, intention or good faith of anything forming part of those proceedings in Parliament;

  (b)       otherwise questioning or establishing the credibility, motive, intention or good faith of any person; or

  (c)        drawing, or inviting the drawing of, inferences or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of those proceedings in Parliament.

      (4)  A court or tribunal shall not:

  (a)       require to be produced, or admit into evidence, a document that has been prepared for the purpose of submission, and submitted, to a House or a committee and has been directed by a House or a committee to be treated as evidence taken in camera, or admit evidence relating to such a document; or

  (b)       admit evidence concerning any oral evidence taken by a House or a committee in camera or require to be produced or admit into evidence a document recording or reporting any such oral evidence, unless a House or a committee has published, or authorised the publication of, that document or a report of that oral evidence.

      (5)  In relation to proceedings in a court or tribunal so far as they relate to:

  (a)       a question arising under section 57 of the Constitution; or

  (b)       the interpretation of an Act;

  neither this section nor the Bill of Rights, 1688 shall be taken to prevent or restrict the admission in evidence of a record of proceedings in Parliament published by or with the authority of a House or a committee or the making of statements, submissions or comments based on that record.

      (6)  In relation to a prosecution for an offence against this Act or an Act establishing a committee, neither this section nor the Bill of Rights, 1688 shall be taken to prevent or restrict the admission of evidence, the asking of questions, or the making of statements, submissions or comments, in relation to proceedings in Parliament to which the offence relates.

      (7)  Without prejudice to the effect that article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688 had, on its true construction, before the commencement of this Act, this section does not affect proceedings in a court or a tribunal that commenced before the commencement of this Act.”

  It may be seen from the opening words of s 16 that it engrafts the provisions of Article 9 and declares their effect to extend to that of the subsequent provisions of s 16.  That does not codify or limit the operation of Article 9 in Australia for its declared effect is “in addition to any other operation”.

  42                  In a written submission the President of the Senate, through the Clerk of the Senate, contended that the relevant law of parliamentary privilege is largely codified in s 16.  It was said of the section:

  “It restricts the use to which evidence of parliamentary proceedings may be put in proceedings before a court or tribunal.”

  Reference was made to 16(2) and the extended definition of “proceedings” therein. The decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in O’Chee v Rowley (1997) 150 ALR 199 was cited.  That case concerned defamation proceedings against a member of the Senate who had been ordered, in the Supreme Court, to produce certain documents for inspection.  His claim for parliamentary privilege raised in respect of those documents was rejected at first instance.  The Court of Appeal set aside the order for inspection. McPherson JA, with whom Moynihan J agreed, held that documents said by the Senator to have been created, prepared or brought into existence for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of Senate business were within the scope of parliamentary privilege derived from s 16.  In so concluding McPherson JA looked for a connection with the then current business in the Senate Chamber.  He compared the dates and descriptions of the relevant documents with extracts from the Weekly Senate Hansards which were in evidence.  He observed:

  “…it is in my opinion enough to say that recording and compiling notes of information supplied and writing letters on a particular subject in anticipation of imminent discussion or debate on the same subject in the Senate is what one would ordinarily expect a member of parliament to do before speaking on that topic in the House.”(at 208-209)

   

  Other documents in issue consisted principally, if not exclusively, of letters sent by or documents received from other persons or sources.  The mere receipt by a parliamentarian of such documents would not, of course, confer parliamentary privilege on them.  McPherson JA said at 209:

  “The privilege is not attracted to a document by s 16(2) until at earliest the parliamentary member or his or her agent does some act with respect to it for purposes of transacting business in the House.”

  McPherson JA also considered the question whether production of a document covered by s 16(2) under compulsory process of the Court, amounted to impeaching or questioning in any court proceedings in parliament within the meaning of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights which has to be read in conjunction with s 16.  This is consistent with the approach taken in the submission lodged on behalf of the President of the Senate where it is said that: 

  “In order to invoke the immunity against production of documents, the documents in question would have to be closely related to proceedings in parliament such that they would fall within the expression used in the Parliamentary Privileges Act, “for purposes of or incidental to” proceedings in Parliament.”

  43                  It may confidently be supposed that most, if not all of the documents seized from Senator Crane’s Parliamentary and Electorate offices would be recognisable by parliamentarians as typical of the myriad of papers that are produced as an incident of work as a parliamentarian.  But that work and the papers it generates extend well beyond what could be described as “in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or a committee”.  I would not have regarded the itineraries as falling within the protected class.  The fact that they may include names of constituents who have made representations or have had meetings with the Senator and which neither they nor the Senator would want to make public does not of itself raise an issue of parliamentary privilege.  The documents do not otherwise answer the description in s 16.

  44                  The documents on the disks, to a substantial degree, comprise internal office communications and standard documents which will have little, if any, relevance to the proper objects of the search warrants.  On the other hand, some which might relate to the Senator’s movements during the relevant period, may be of relevance.  Like the itineraries, any such documents would seem unlikely to attract parliamentary privilege by reference to the criteria in s 16.

  45                  In the end however while these observations may be of assistance to the parties in reviewing their respective positions, they are academic.  That is because in my opinion it does not fall to this Court to determine the exercise of parliamentary privilege here.  Indeed it does not seem to me that the relevant privilege, if it exists, arises under s 16 at all.  The documents in question have been seized pursuant to a search warrant issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914.  The issue of the warrants, albeit done in each case by an issuing officer who was a magistrate, was an administrative and not a judicial act:

  “The power to issue a warrant to enter, search and seize must be exercised judicially.  But these indicia do not stamp the power to issue a search warrant with the character of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.  The issuing of a warrant can be described as a judicial act but not in the sense of an adjudication to determine the rights of parties.  Although judicial review is available to review an exercise of the power to issue a warrant, it is available whether the power be classified as judicial or as administrative in nature.  And although the duty to exercise the power to issue a warrant must be exercised judicially, that means only that the power must be exercised without bias and fairly weighing the competing considerations of privacy and private property on the one hand and law enforcement on the other.  In Love v Attorney-General (NSW),  this Court held that the power conferred by a State law on the Supreme Court of New South Wales to issue a warrant authorising the use of a listening device was an administrative not a judicial power, though it was a power to be exercised judicially.  Nor was the act of exercising the power a judicial act in the sense of an adjudication to determine the rights of parties.”Grollo v Palmer (1995) 184 CLR 348 at 359-360

   

  The former s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 was the statutory predecessor of s 3E.  The latter provision was substituted for s 10 by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994.  In the joint majority judgment of the High Court in Jacobsen v Rogers (1995) 182 CLR 572, it was said of s 10:

  “The section is concerned with the investigation and prosecution of crime.  That is a function of the executive government and the section operates in aid of that function.” (at 587)

   

  The issue of a search warrant therefore differs fundamentally from the issue of a subpoena or the making by a court of an order for the production and inspection of documents or the requirement that a person answer questions.  Those are coercive processes of a court.  The court can be asked, in connection with those processes, to determine questions of parliamentary privilege that may arise pursuant to s 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and Article 9 of the Bill of Rights which are essentially concerned with the interaction between parliamentary and judicial proceedings.  The issue of a search warrant is an executive act in aid of an executive investigation.  The investigation may lead to the initiation of criminal proceedings.  It may clear the person concerned or yield insufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a prosecution.  The issue of a search warrant itself does not commence any judicial proceeding.  The production of the documents for which privilege was claimed in this case to the Registrar of the ACT Supreme Court and subsequently to the District Registrar of this Court, does not change the character of the seizure.  Whether privilege is to be asserted by the Senate must therefore be resolved between the investigating authorities and the parliament.

  46                  It might be thought that the approach outlined above runs counter to the proposition, for which Jacobsen v Rogers is authority,  that a claim of public interest immunity raised by a State agency against seizure of documents under a Federal search warrant can be dealt with on judicial review of that warrant.  The majority in their joint judgment said in that case:

  “As is demonstrated by Baker v Campbell [(1983) 153 CLR 52] and by this case, if a dispute arises as to the existence of the immunity, means are available to obtain a judicial determination of the issue.  In any event, practical difficulties in giving effect to the immunity in the context of the execution of a search warrant would seem to us to be an inadequate reason for holding the doctrine to be inapplicable.” (at 589)

  The proposition that a court, on judicial review of the issue or execution of a search warrant, can determine claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity in relation to seized documents, does not translate to the case in which a claim of parliamentary privilege is made in respect of the seizure.  This is because there is a fundamental difference between public interest immunity and parliamentary privilege.  The immunity from production that courts will concede to some official documents is the expression of a self imposed judicial restraint.  It involves a balancing exercise between the interests of the executive in the confidentiality of certain documents and the competing interest in the administration of justice.  This may be subject to principles conferring near absolute immunity on cabinet papers – Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1993) 176 CLR 604. 

  47                  The sources of parliamentary privilege in the Commonwealth parliament are the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Parliamentary Privileges Act.  Those sources, while partly codifying the privilege through s 16 leave in place other elements of the powers, privileges and immunities of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the establishment of the Commonwealth.  But whatever the full content of parliamentary privilege it does not derive from judge made rules nor does it depend for its application upon any exercise of judicial discretion.  While the law of parliamentary privilege may properly be applied by the court in judicial proceedings where the privilege impacts upon the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction and powers, it is not, in the ordinary course, for the courts to decide questions of privilege as between the Executive and the Parliament in litigation between the subject and the executive.  That is not to say that such questions may not arise in litigation in which, for example, the presiding officer of the House is a party, eg Egan v Willis (1998) 195 CLR 424. 

  48                  The question of parliamentary privilege against executive action arose for consideration in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Halden v Marks (1995) 17 WAR 447.  There the court was asked, in proceedings between a Royal Commissioner and a member of parliament, whether the Commissioner could proceed under his terms of reference, which related to the presentation of a petition to the Legislative Council, without breaching the privileges and immunities of parliament.  The Full Court, like the judge at first instance, declined to adjudicate upon the point.  It accepted as a “settled principle” the proposition that “the courts will not intrude on the role of Parliament and will endeavour to regulate their own proceedings so as to avoid doing so” (at 462).  As was pointed out in the judgment, the cases in which courts have adjudicated upon parliamentary privilege fall into two main categories:

  1.         Where a question of parliamentary privilege is raised in a case already before the court, as for example, where a party seeks to rely on something said to done in parliament.

  2.         Where the court has been asked to review action by parliament to enforce its proceedings, most commonly where parliament has by warrant sought to subject a citizen to restraint by arrest. (462)

  Their Honours said:

  “In this case, the appellants seek to have judicially determined both what is the application of the privilege defined in Art 9 to the proceedings and the proposed proceedings in the Commission, and whether the conduct of those proceedings will be a breach of that privilege.  We cannot see how that can be done without intruding into the exclusive domain of parliament to “determine for itself, without review, what is contempt”: see Victoria Legislative Assembly Speaker v Glass (1871) LR 3, PC App 560 at 573.”

  49                  As senior counsel for the third respondent said, there are few occasions when any person comes to the court simply seeking to vindicate a privilege of parliament where it is not incidental to some pending cause before the court.  Counsel characterised this application, insofar as it related to parliamentary privilege, as an attempt to enforce through the court a claim for privilege, a course not done or permitted in the past.  Counsel submitted that if the claim is to be advanced or vindicated then it should be done by the parliament and in the parliament.  Counsel for the President of the Senate had no instructions on the question whether the court was an appropriate forum for the ventilation of the privilege issue, but submitted that that was really for the court to decide.  No submission was made on behalf of the Senate on the question whether parliamentary privilege under s 16 of the Act could be invoked in relation to the search and seizure of documents pursuant to a search warrant.  As is apparent, I agree with the thrust of the submission made by counsel for the third respondent.  Where documents the subject of a claim of privilege on the part of a House of Parliament are tendered in a court in the context of a prosecution or other proceeding the court may have to decide the question for itself, applying the provisions of s 16.  But the subject documents, being seized in aid of a lawful administrative investigation, the claim for privilege in respect of them does not arise under s 16 and does not otherwise fall for determination by the court in this litigation.

  Conclusion

  50                  For the above reasons, the application will be dismissed.  I will make an order that the applicant pay the third respondent’s costs of the application, but will allow liberty to apply to vary that order within fourteen days.  In respect of the documents which were retained in the custody of the Court and which I have examined, I will direct that they be delivered to the Clerk of the Senate to be dealt with in accordance with the directions of the President of the Senate.  As to that order I will also allow the parties, within fourteen days, to make submissions to vary its terms if an alternative disposition can be agreed.

      Regina v David John PARKER 
      
      
       
      
     On 17 March 2000 the appellant pleaded guilty to five counts of offences against ss24(2) and 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). The offences were committed between December 1995 and September 1997.  
      
       
     Count 1 was for knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity and the appellant was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. Counts 2, 4 and 5 related to knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity. Sentences of fixed terms of 6 years, 7 years and 7 years imprisonment respectively were imposed for these counts, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Count 3 was not raised in the appeal. 
      
       
     The sentencing Judge found that the appellant had played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. He was not merely a courier of drugs and a main part of his role involved storing and transporting drugs. 
      
       
     The appellant applied to change his pleas of guilty to pleas of not guilty on counts 2, 4 and 5. He also appealed against the severity of sentence on count 1. 
      
       
     The appeal concerned the meaning of the phrase ""step … in the process … of manufacture"" in s6 of the Act. The appellant argued that the pleas of guilty should be reopened because of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v BD [2001] NSWCCA 184 and R v McCoy [2001] NSWCCA 255, both given after the appellant was sentenced.  
      
       
     In respect of count 2 the sentencing Judge had found that the only physical act in which the appellant seemed to be involved was the popping of Sudafed tablets from their blister packs. The appellant submitted that in light of the decision in R v BD, it was not a fact capable in law of founding his conviction. Similarly, the sentencing Judge's statements that there was no evidence that the appellant actually himself participated in any of the cooking operations and that his role was in assisting in getting the chemicals together for the purposes of the exercise meant that on the same principle there was no foundation for a finding of his guilt on counts 4 and 5. There was evidence that the appellant had been advised to plead guilty by his legal advisers because of their belief that these preparatory activities were steps in the manufacture. 
      
       
     Further, in relation to counts 4 and 5, the appellant argued that the evidence established that because of the poor quality of the raw materials it would have been impossible for large commercial quantities of methylamphetamine to be produced: R v McCoy. The offences were incapable of being committed by the appellant in the manner alleged and as such his convictions were not capable in law of being sustained.  
      
       
     The Crown conceded that the length of the sentence imposed for count 1 was excessive and demonstrated a sentencing structure which did not accord with the principles established by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. However it was argued that the totality of the sentences should not be disturbed. 
      
       
        
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Hidden J and Howie J concurring):Change of Pleas 
      
       
     1. The appellant's pleas of guilty constituted an admission of the essential elements of the offences charged. The pleas must be considered final subject only to the sentencing Judge's discretion to grant leave to change the plea before the matter is disposed of by sentence; Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. Before an appellant should be permitted to reopen his pleas of guilty he must demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice had occurred; see the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453. 
      
       
     2. It is clear that the conduct of the appellant in removing the Sudafed tablets from their plastic containers which founded count 2 was with the view to using the tablets in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. R v BD should not be treated as determining that a person removing Sudafed or similar tablets from their containers with the intention of using the contents to manufacture methylamphetamine can never be said to be taking a step in the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine: see Kouroumalos and Thomas v R (1993) 67 A Crim R 308. 
      
       
     3. R v McCoy is distinguished on the basis that despite the extent of the period encompassed by the charge, the matter was put to the jury on the basis of activities being carried on at, and just prior to, the appellant's arrest. In this case counts 4 and 5 related to a period of over 12 months. The sentencing Judge correctly concluded that the appellant played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. 
      
       
     Sentence 
      
       
     4. The sentence for count 1 was excessive and should be quashed. The Court re-sentenced the appellant to 9 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     5. In approaching each offence separately and fixing an appropriate sentence for that offence, the question of whether the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative or partially cumulative must take account of the totality of the sentence for all the offences charged. In this case it is appropriate that the sentences are partially cumulative.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA 
      
       
        
       Introduction 
        
         
        
       On 17 March 2000, the appellant, David John Parker, pleaded guilty before Judge Woods QC to five counts of offences against ss24(2) and 25(1) and (2) of the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        1985 (the Act), which can conveniently be called counts 1 to 5. The first three counts were in an indictment dated 10 December 1999 and the remaining two in an indictment dated 19 October 1999.  
        
       
     2 The first count was for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 30 July and 20 September 1997. The second count was for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount which was not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 20 January and 30 September 1997. The third count was for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, commonly known as ecstasy, between 20 January and 17 June 1997. The fourth count was for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 1 December 1995 and 31 January 1997 and the fifth count for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 1 December 1995 and 30 June 1996. In the first count the supply was alleged to have taken place at Wahroonga. In the second and third counts the manufacturing and supply were alleged to have taken place at Kariong in New South Wales. In the fourth and fifth counts the manufacturing was alleged to have taken place at Sydney. 
      
       
     3 The sentences imposed by Judge Woods were on the first count imprisonment for 13 years with a minimum term of 10 years; on the second count a fixed term of 6 years imprisonment; on the third count a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment; on the fourth count a fixed term of 7 years imprisonment and on the fifth count a fixed term of 7 years imprisonment. The terms were to be served concurrently commencing from 10 November 1999. On the first count the sentencing Judge took into account an offence on a Form 1 of supplying the prohibited drug, amphetamine, being an amount not less than the applicable commercial quantity on 16 September 1998 at Rockdale, while the appellant was released on bail.  
      
       
     4 This appeal concerns in part the meaning of the phrase “step … in the process of … manufacture” in s6 of the Act. Relevantly s6 of the Act provides that: 
      
       
        
         
         “[A] person takes part in … the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug if: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that … manufacture, production or supply.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     5 The appellant applies to change his pleas of guilty to pleas of not guilty on the second, fourth and fifth counts and appeals against the severity of sentence on the first count. The appellant does not challenge the conviction or sentence imposed on the third count or the sentences imposed on the second, fourth or fifth counts. 
      
       
        
       Remarks on sentence 
        
       
     6 In his remarks on sentence, Judge Woods said it was clear that the appellant had played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. His Honour found that although the appellant had some role independent of a man called Leslie Kalache, his activities, as appeared from the material before the sentencing Judge, were mainly as a subordinate accomplice of Kalache. Judge Woods said that the role played by the appellant was by no means so extensive, complex and dominant as the role played by Kalache but nonetheless he played a significant role as lieutenant to Kalache. He was not merely a courier of drugs. A main part of his role with Kalache was storing and transporting the illegal drugs at Kalache’s direction. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The approach I take in constructing these sentences is to take each count separately to identify an appropriate sentence reflecting the criminality of that behaviour and then subsequently to consider questions of accumulation or concurrency.” 
         
        
        
       Count 1 
        
       
     7 On 19 September 1997 the appellant and a man called Frank Bera were arrested in a motor vehicle on their way from Kariong to Sydney. Bera had driven from Sydney at the appellant’s request and direction early in the morning to the appellant’s residence at 22 Vasey Close, Kariong. At about 6.50am they left together in the vehicle ferrying drugs to Sydney for Kalache. At Wahroonga the vehicle, which had been under surveillance, was stopped. A search revealed a sports bag behind a front passenger seat in which were six resealable plastic bags each containing methylamphetamine. The weight of the drugs was 1.885 kilograms. When he was arrested the appellant denied any knowledge of drugs. The appellant and Bera were subsequently charged.  
      
       
     8 The purpose of the exercise was to transfer the drugs to Kalache in Sydney for on-sale to buyers. Kalache had been the subject of extensive surveillance. This produced many taped telephone conversations, some between Kalache and other people but many involving the appellant. Judge Woods quoted parts of telephone conversations in which the appellant took part on 7 and 8 August and 18 and 20 September 1997. His Honour said he had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the trip on 19 September to Sydney involved the transportation of the methylamphetamine for and to Kalache.  
      
       
     9 The Crown submitted that the telephone conversation of 20 September, after the arrest, indicated that the appellant was not merely a tool of Kalache, rather an independent agent with another supply business and that 
      
       
        
         
         “because Kalache had had trouble with the manufacture of the drugs by the chemical cooking process, [the appellant] had filled the gap and [sic] from his independent sources, supplying Kalache with enough drugs to keep his business ticking over, so to speak, until another methylamphetamine production ‘cook’ could be established.” 
         
        
        
       However Judge Woods did not feel satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this inference could safety be drawn. He said that whether the appellant had a large quantity of methylamphetamine stored in his backyard for Kalache or for himself, the fact was that that he had it, and had demonstrated that he was a significant drug dealer. His Honour said that the offence required a severe deterrent penalty. 
        
        
       Count 2 
        
       
     10 Judge Woods said that Kalache and the appellant had suffered a drought of supply to Kalache from his “manufacturers”. Kalache got several people to obtain a large quantity of Sudafed tablets and “Chemists’ Own” brand tablets containing pseudoephedrine. About 19,000 tablets were obtained from a registered pharmacist Cheng. A clandestine drugs laboratory was set up involving a person called Lyndon Marskell to extract an illegal ingredient from the otherwise lawful Sudafed tablets and the other tablets, to extract pseudoephedrine and carry out a further reaction to manufacture methylamphetamine to be sold by Kalache and others for profit. The laboratory was set up at Washpool Creek near Booral. In fact what was created was largely seized by the police executing a search warrant at 1 Jacques Street Kingsford on 2 July 1997. At that time 3.4 kilograms of methylamphetamine were seized. Analysis proved that this drug was manufactured by Marskell and others at Booral. 
      
       
     11 His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The direct role which this offender played in relation to that exercise was to participate with the others in physically removing individual Sudafed or ‘Chemists’ Own’ brand tablets from the plastic containers, an exercise which is recorded on various tapes with a ‘popping’ noise. On 26 June 1997, [the appellant] was recorded as saying, or lamenting: ‘All, you know, is we’ve been going for three hours and it feels like we’ve done nothing’. 
         
        
        
         
         Anyway, they did in fact continue ‘popping’ the tablets from their pockets and a lot was produced and seized. But the full scope of [the appellant’s] involvement is not reflected entirely in the mere physical exercise that I have described. The conversations in which he is captured on tape indicate his intimate knowledge of the exercise. For example, on 21 January 1997 in a telephone conversation with the Watkins, [the appellant] says: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘8 kilos of pseudo, 8 litres of acid, 800 grams of red phosphorus, put it in a 20 litre bowl and you cook it for 24 hours (something indecipherable) 36 hours, then you cool it down, right, that’s what I’m telling you.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Then he goes on further to explain his knowledge of this exercise. He says further: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘It’s a simple process, but the thing is, if you make one mistake and you don’t know what you’re doing, you’ve got to go back three stages and find out the one, basically, you know what I mean? Like that stupid Roland he used cold water, he didn’t use hot water, he didn’t know why he stuffed it. Little things like that.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His knowledge of this criminal business was substantial. 
         
        
        
         
         It is further demonstrated in a conversation of 21 January 1997 when he says: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘40, after cutting 4 to 1 you’d finish with an average cook, well, a bag cooked about 40 now should be about 44 and (something indecipherable) cost about 48.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Then he goes on to discuss the production of this product by the illegal cooking method. 
         
        
        
         
         Nonetheless, despite that knowledge, the only physical act in which he seems to be involved here is in the popping of the Sudafed tablets. Nonetheless, this is a vital part of the exercise and is essential in this particular form of illegal manufacturing. There is no doubt that it produced a quantity of drugs which was very substantial indeed, 3.4 kilograms at least.” 
         
        
        
       Counts 4 and 5 
        
       
     12 The sentencing Judge said that both these charges derived from the involvement of Kalache and a man called Arthur Launt, an industrial chemist from Queensland, “who went wrong”. Launt had deviated from legitimate business into the profitable business of supplying precursor drugs for the production of unlawful methylamphetamine tablets. In December 1995 Kalache contacted Launt by telephone. The sentencing Judge had no doubt that he did so with the appellant’s knowledge and acquiescence. Kalache requested Launt to supply 7.5 litres of hydriodic acid for $7,400. This product was one of the essential precursors for the cooking process of methylamphetamine. Other products were obtained from Launt paid for by Kalache. Launt had a man called Dolman, a skilled industrial chemist, who assisted in the manufacture of phenylacetic acid and other compounds. The sentencing Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “After the acquisition of these various chemicals, Lyndon Marskell, working essentially for Kalache, established a clandestine drug laboratory at Wollombi in New South Wales. Marskell had difficulties producing methylamphetamine using Launt’s phenylacetic acid.  
         
        
        
         
         That property was found by police in April 1996 and ultimately it was seized.” 
         
        
       
     13 Through the agency of a person called Richard Simpson a further laboratory using materials derived from Launt was established at Dooralong. This laboratory was subsequently moved to premises at Sylvania Waters which were owned by a person called Robert Proctor. It seemed to the sentencing Judge that the appellant played some role in relation to both these exercises. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “One of the problems was, it turns out, that Launt had produced defective material which was being used in these various exercises. The Wollombi illicit laboratory site was demonstrated to have produced methylamphetamine using pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus and hydriodic acid.  
         
        
        
         
         The Sylvania Waters laboratory revealed evidence of an attempt to make methylamphetamine using a phenylacetic acid conversion process. The likelihood of actually producing large quantities of methylamphetamine was limited by the deficiency of the chemicals supplied by Launt.” 
         
        
       
     14 To understand what is then recorded on the remarks on sentence it is necessary to refer to the 61 page facts sheet (the facts sheet) dated 12 December 1999 which was before the sentencing Judge. Reference was made to the police discovery of the clandestine drug laboratory site and storage area of precursor chemicals at Wollombi on 3 April 1996. In March 1996 the appellant and another person met Launt twice to establish future supplies of precursor chemicals which Launt supplied with similar faults to compounds previously supplied. On 15 April 1996 police discovered the illicit laboratory active in the bathroom of the house at Dooralong. The process used a 20 litre reaction flask, a stainless steel pot with oil and an electric hot plate and condenser, mounted in the shower recess with garden hoses. The chemical analysis of the process indicated that phenylacetic acid was converted through to P-2-P to methylamphetamine. Phenylacetic acid and benzoic acid were identified in the laboratory. Similarly a large quantity of black 20 litre drums containing labelled reducing agents, consistent with Launt’s misrepresented chemicals, were seized. Premises were found at Glenfield to be used for the next manufacture process by another person. A clandestine laboratory was established there. It was not suggested the appellant played any part in this. Although this laboratory was not detected it was decided on 23 April 1996 to move the reaction chemicals and equipment to new premises at Sylvania Waters where “the syndicate” established a clandestine drug laboratory. William El Azzi was employed as a cook at Dooralong and Sylvania Waters. In or about June 1996 Robert McCoy was recruited to stay at the Sylvania Waters premises and operate and clean the laboratory site.  
      
       
     15 At some time in July or August 1996 Kalache told Launt that the chemicals he supplied, “were not any good and they couldn’t do anything with it”. This related to the quality of chemicals Launt was supplying to Kalache, the appellant and Haeusler. Later in 1996, as a result of slow payments by Kalache, Launt, who was supplying hydriodic acid, diluted it. This had the effect of making pseudoephedrine reduction reactions to methylamphetamine very inefficient.  
      
       
     16 The last five paragraphs of the facts sheet at page 61 were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Wollombi laboratory site analysis reveal evidence of methylamphetamine being produced by the reduction of pseudoephedrine through red phosphorous and hydriodic acid and evidence of alternate attempts to manufacture methylamphetamine using a phenylacetic acid conversion. The quantity of precursors on site indicated the forensic evidence taken indicated that commercial quantities of methylamphetamine had been produced in the past. The stockpile of chemicals, solvents, reagents and apparatus would have allowed for large quantities of methylamphetamine produced in the future [sic]. 
         
        
        
         
         The Dooralong laboratory site analysis revealed evidence of methylamphetamine being produced using a phenylacetic conversion. The volume of reaction mixture located was 21.45kg (containing a mixture of benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid). 
         
        
        
         
         The Sylvania Waters laboratory revealed evidence of an attempted methylamphetamine process using a phenylacetic acid conversion. However the integrity of the starting precursor materials would have prevented this reaction to proceed successfully. The volume of reaction mixture located was approximately 17ltrs (containing a mixture of benzoic acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid). 
         
        
        
         
         A statement from Mr Murtagh of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory demonstrates the consistency in methodology and chemicals used in these laboratory sites.” 
         
        
       
     17 Investigations conducted during 1998 involved lawfully obtained Telephone Intercepts on services used by the accused and Haeusler, and provide direct corroboration of the activities and facts as detailed. 
      
       
     18 At the point in his remarks on sentence which I had reached, Judge Woods raised with the Crown his concern about count 5 and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “at either Dooralong or Sylvania Waters was any quantity of the prohibited drug and specifically an amount not less than the commercial quantity? If you look at page 61 of the facts it is the third last paragraph. It suggested it was rather an attempt.” 
         
        
        
       Questioned by the Judge about whether that paragraph meant that the charge should be one of taking part in the attempt to manufacture, the Crown responded:  
        
        
         
         “No because the charge does not only involve the failed process at Sylvania Waters, it also involves the Dooralong part of it and there was …“  
         
        
        
       His Honour interrupted counsel. A little later his Honour said: 
        
        
         
         “Is it not the case that the Dooralong laboratory site produced no actual methylamphetamine?”  
         
        
        
       The Crown replied:  
        
        
         
         “I think that it was discovered in the process by the police when the manufacturing process was in train. The police arrived and effectively shut down that laboratory.”  
         
        
        
       The sentencing Judge said: 
        
        
         
         “I think that would strictly be an attempt rather than – I do not know. I know it is not a point taken by Mr Young [who appeared for the appellant] in those terms but I should not sentence if it is not right.” 
         
        
        
       The Crown said: 
        
        
         
         “Your Honour, to knowingly take part in the manufacture you can take a step in the process. The process does not have to result in the production of an actual product.” 
         
        
        
       Asked for authority the Crown referred to  
       Thomas v R 
        (1993) 67 A Crim R 308. The Crown said that in  
       Thomas  
       the quantity was not manufactured, all that was manufactured was a precursor.  
        
        
         
         “It was not even at that point a prohibited drug itself. All that Thomas manufactured was P2P and I think that was the same in  
         Louden 
          and his associates too. But the case of  
         Thomas 
          is the authority for the proposition that taking a step in the process of manufacture and that is what is the basis of the charge anyway: Knowingly take part.” 
         
        
       
     19 After reference to s6 of the Act, the sentencing Judge said “[t]he fact the process is interrupted at an intermediate stage does not take the case outside section six is the Court of Criminal Appeal decision” to which the Crown replied “Yes”. The sentencing Judge said that he found that surprising. “Obviously that is the law and obviously Mr Young has gone through the exercise in his mind anyway.” Mr Young said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not think they had a couple of P2P. They said it was for another reason but they ended up convicted of manufacturing methylamphetamine having only reached that stage.” 
         
        
        
       The sentencing Judge thanked counsel and said that he had raised the matter because it struck him as being a possible problem. Mr Young said:  
        
        
         
         ‘It is fairly significant in terms of potential success of the operation. If you look at the Dooralong laboratory it was interrupted during the actual process and there is the amount. It does not appear over the page where your Honour has already observed. The fourth last paragraph on 61 refers to 21.45 of the reaction mixture located. That refers back to the second one on 59 when it talks about the process being interrupted. And because of what is being used they can say these chemicals having come from x, y, z but the bottom line is no product came out at Sylvania Waters.” 
         
        
        
       Judge Woods said that he understood that and would take it into account. He continued to deal with counts 4 and 5. 
        
       
     20 His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The role played by the offender in this exercise in counts four and five is less significant than in the role played by Kalache [sic]. Nonetheless in each case he did have a hand in getting together the chemicals which were used in both operations. 
         
        
        
         
         It would seem likely that the captured telephone conversations in 1997 where he was to speak with knowledge about the cooking processes, derived from the contact he had in the earlier years 1995 and 1996 and 1997 which gave rise to charges in counts four and five. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence that the offender actually himself participated in either, or any, of the cooking operations by Marskell or Simpson or others. Nonetheless, his role in assisting in getting the chemicals together for the purposes of the exercise was nonetheless significant. 
         
        
        
         
         I have said before in relation to count one that gaol sentences are called for. Courts have repeatedly said in relation to all of these kinds of matters that there must be a gaol sentence and there is no other appropriate penalty. 
         
        
        
         
         I take into account the subjective matters which have been put before me through his brother-in-law who gave evidence that ‘He’s a good family man and he’s a loving father’. I take that into account. 
         
        
        
         
         And I take into account the plea of guilty. It is significant and in my view; it demonstrates contrition as well as providing a practical benefit to the court system by reducing court time. 
         
        
        
         
         This is not one of those cases where the criminality is so gross and overwhelming that the plea of guilty has no particular significance. In fact, the plea of guilty has reduced by some two or three years the overall sentence which I would have imposed but for the plea. 
         
        
        
         
         Counts four and five were generated, as I understand it, by further inquiries being made following on the telephonic interceptions at the Kalache house. 
         
        
        
         
         They extend the period of this man’s criminality over a longer period. Nonetheless all the offences it appear to me to be generally related [sic]. If he were an independent agent having a role in drugs separately from Kalache, it has not been demonstrated to me beyond reasonable doubt. Generally he had a role, as I see it, as a subordinate to Kalache, but as a significant subordinate.” 
         
        
       
     21 Following discussion with counsel the sentencing Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I intend to regard the sequence of events encompassing all of these counts as being in a related period in this man’s life. The common factors of associates, the nature of the drug and continuing involvement makes concurrent sentencing appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         NO SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
         
        
        
         
         I do not see this as a case where there are any special circumstances justifying any variation from the norm between the overall sentence and the minimum sentence in the light of any particular circumstance of the offender’s background or of the offences. 
         
        
        
         
         I repeat my observation that I see his role as being one of a subordinate associate of Kalache and that his criminality is by no means so extensive and complex as that of Kalache. Nonetheless, he played a significant role as lieutenant. He was not merely a courier but a main part of his work was with Kalache in storing and transporting drug at Kalache’s direction. 
         
        
        
         
         I take into account the subjective features advanced by Mr Young, the probation and parole report and what his brother-in-law said.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     22 Judge Woods convicted the appellant on all five counts and imposed the sentences I have already set out. 
      
       
     23 The Crown conceded that, even though looked at overall, the total of the sentences imposed on the five counts was not disproportionate to the criminality of the appellant’s conduct, the length of the sentence imposed for the offence charged in count 1 to be served concurrently with the sentences on the other four counts was excessive and demonstrated a sentencing structure which did not accord with what the High Court had said in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly at 624 and 629. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality. The High Court pointed out that a failure to do this may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders, as indeed has happened in this case when the sentence imposed on Bera is compared with the sentence imposed on the appellant on the first count. Before dealing with this error in sentencing it is convenient to turn to the appellant’s submissions in respect of counts 2, 4 and 5. 
      
       
        
       Change of pleas 
        
       
     24 The appellant’s pleas of guilty constituted an admission of the essential elements of the offences charged. His guilt of those offences was determined when Judge Woods passed sentence. The pleas must be considered final subject only to the judge’s discretion to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty before the matter is disposed of by sentence; Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. At 511 Dawson and McHugh JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered. But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty.” 
         
        
       
     25 Before an appellant should be permitted to reopen his pleas of guilty on counts 2, 4 and 5 he must demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred; see the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453. The Chief Judge pointed out that this may occur where in offering a plea, the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charges or where on the admitted facts the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offences. However, as Kirby P said in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122: 
      
       
        
         
         “For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence.” 
         
        
        
       Later decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal 
        
       
     26 The problems about the pleas of guilty to these three counts come about because of two decisions of this Court; R v BD [2001] NSWCCA 184 and R v McCoy [2001] NSWCCA 255, both given after the appellant was sentenced on 17 March 2000. 
      
       
     27 In BD the Court considered a question for determination under s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The question was whether a trial judge in trying a case alone had erred in law in concluding that the obtaining and transporting of ingredients (namely Sudafed, phosphorus powder and orthophosphoric acid) and implements to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine could not constitute taking a step in the process of manufacture within the meaning of s6 of the Act. In that case the accused had been stopped by police while driving a motor vehicle. A search of the vehicle revealed a number of carry bags in one of which there was a substantial quantity of Sudafed tablets, some loose and some in blister packs. The other ingredients were also found together with items of chemistry glassware which appeared to be new. There was evidence that Sudafed tablets contained pseudoephedrine, a precursor for the making of methylamphetamine. The method of doing this illicitly by the reduction of pseudoephedrine was referred to. There was also evidence that the first thing done at the beginning of the extraction process was the removal of the Sudafed tablets from their blister packets. The next step was to crush the tablets and add a solvent.  
      
       
     28 The Crown contended that the acquisition and transportation of chemicals and equipment necessary for the manufacture of methylamphetamine was a step in the process of manufacture. The Crown also relied on the removal of the Sudafed tablets from their blister packs as a discrete step in the process of manufacture.  
      
       
     29 Bell J, with whose reasons for judgment Stein JA and Greg James J agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “17 Judge Graham accepted that a step, being an intermediate stage in the process of manufacturing a prohibited drug, would fall within the terms of s6(a). In this respect his Honour accepted that it would not be necessary, at the time of taking the intermediate step, for the person to have possession of (or access to) all of the equipment and all of the chemicals necessary to complete the process. The question his Honour identified was ‘whether the acquisition of the wherewithal and its transportation to another place amounted to a step in the process of manufacture.’ His Honour considered that a distinction should be drawn between preparatory acts and acts which, in truth, represented steps in the process of manufacture. It followed that acts which were merely preparatory did not fall within the statutory prohibition. 
         
        
        
         
         18 In Judge Graham’s view the acquisition and transportation of the chemicals amounted to no more than the respondent equipping himself with materials necessary to undertake the process of manufacture at a future time. In similar vein the removal of the Sudafed tablets from their blister packs could not be described as anything more than preparation for a future process of manufacture. 
         
        
        
         
         19 In submissions before this Court the Crown contended that Judge Graham erred in drawing the distinction between acts which are merely preparatory to the process of manufacture and steps in a process of manufacture.” 
         
        
       
     30 Thomas and Kouroumalos were referred to together with other cases. In Kouroumalos the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of “knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity”. The sentencing judge had before him a statement of facts including, relevantly, that the appellant had removed a very large quantity of Sudafed tablets from their foil containers. Bell J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “27 … The facts further alleged that the appellant had paid for and collected Ph papers, vacuum grease and drums of acetone each being substances required for the manufacture of methylamphetamine. He had kept at his home vacuum flasks and other utensils used in the manufacturing process and he had engaged in testing the glucose content of some methylamphetamine supplied to him by the organisation and reported back on his findings.” 
         
        
       
     31 The following passage from the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in Kouroumalos was quoted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Its case in relation to the first count was that, being aware that the Sudafed tablets he popped, and the other items he fetched, were required for the manufacture of the prohibited drugs, he ‘knowingly participated in their manufacture’ by carrying out those activities. They were necessary steps in the operation, as was the provision of his premises as a place to pop the Sudafed tablets from which the required pseudoephedrine was recovered, and to store the chemical flasks needed for a cook. It was in that sense he knowingly participated in the manufacture of the drugs. That was sufficient as a matter of law: see s6  
         Drug Misuse and Trafficking 
           
         Act 
          1985:  
         Thomas 
          (1993) 67 A Crim R 308 at 310.” 
         
        
       
     32 Bell J continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “30 I do not consider that the passage set out above in  
         Kouroumalos 
          should be seen as supporting the construction of s6 of the Act for which the Crown contends in this case. As noted above, the applicant in  
         Kouroumalos 
          pleaded guilty to the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. He thereby admitted all the legal ingredients of the offence. The evidence disclosed that the organisation of which he was a part was engaged in manufacturing methylamphetamine. His role in ‘popping’ the Sudafed tablets and in carrying out the other activities, including reporting on the glucose content of the methylamphetamine produced by the syndicate, needs to be seen in this light.” 
         
        
       
     33 Based on that decision the appellant submitted that the finding central to the sentencing Judge’s reasoning on count 2 was that the only physical act in which the appellant seemed to be involved was the popping of the Sudafed tablets. Even though this was a vital part of the exercise and was essential in this particular form of illegal manufacturing, it was not a fact capable in law of founding his conviction. His Honour had earlier said that the direct role which the appellant played was to participate with others in physically removing individual Sudafed or “Chemist’s Own” brand tablets from the plastic containers. Similarly the sentencing Judge’s statement that there was no evidence that the appellant actually himself participated in either, or any, of the cooking operations by Marskell or Simpson or others and that his role was in assisting in getting the chemicals together for the purposes of the exercise meant that on the same principle there was no foundation for a finding of his guilt on counts 4 and 5. There was evidence that the appellant had been advised to plead guilty by his legal advisers because of their belief that these preparatory activities were steps in the manufacture. 
      
       
     34 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant filed an affidavit of Michael Anthony Croke, the appellant’s solicitor, sworn on 22 July 2002 in which he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. In relation to Count 2 it was the view of both myself and Counsel appearing at the sentence hearing that the act of ‘popping’ the Sudafed tablets from its packaging constituted all elements of the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. Consequently, Mr Parker was given, and accepted advice that he should plead guilty to that particular matter. 
         
        
        
         
         3. I have subsequently been advised that in  
         R v BD  
         [2001] NSWCCA 184 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has decided that the mere removal of tablets from its packaging is insufficient to ground the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Similarly, in relation to Counts 4 and 5 it was the view of both myself and Counsel appearing at the sentence hearing that the mere attempt to manufacture prohibited drugs founded the offence in question, notwithstanding the fact that the chemicals used by the appellant rendered it impossible for him to do so.” 
         
        
       
     35 After the Court had reserved its decision and with its leave, further affidavits were filed. In an affidavit of 28 July 2002, Mr Croke said: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. In relation to paragraph 4 of my affidavit sworn on 23 July 2002 I add the following: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           a. Mr Parker was sentenced before the decision of  
           R v McCoy 
            [2001] NSWCCA 255 (4 July 2001) was handed down. Until I became aware of that decision I believed that an attempt to manufacture large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine satisfied the offence even though it was physically impossible to produce a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           b. I was aware that Mr Parker had acquired chemicals but until the decision in  
           R v BD  
           [2001] NSWCCA 184 (15 May 2001) I believed that that limited role satisfied the elements of the offence. I therefore advised Mr Parker to plead guilty.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     36 In an affidavit of 29 July 2002, the appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. With respect to Count 2 of the indictment I physically removed Sudafed tablets from their containers. I was not aware of any manufacturing process taking place at that time. I was not involved in the cooking process. I believed on legal advice that my role of removing Sudafed tablets meant that I was guilty. It has since been explained to me that that is not the case. I am therefore not guilty of the Second Count on the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         3. With respect to Counts 4 & 5 of the indictment I was involved in the acquiring of chemicals. I was not involved in the cooking process. I was not aware of any manufacturing process taking place at the time I acquired the chemicals. On legal advice I believed that an attempt to produce large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine meant that I was guilty even though it was impossible to produce a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. It has since been explained to me that that is not the case. On this advice I am therefore not guilty of Counts 4 & 5 on the indictment.” 
         
        
        
         
         4. I have read the two affidavits of Michael Anthony Croke sworn on 23 July 2002 and 28 July 2002. I agree with those affidavits.” 
         
        
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     37 In Thomas a quantity of P-2-P was found in the appellant’s possession. He was convicted of taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. There was evidence that P-2-P was a raw material used in the manufacture of the drug. In that case the police gained access to premises occupied by the appellant in which they found a fully operational laboratory. They found in his possession a substantial quantity of P-2-P which had been produced by the appellant in his laboratory. There was no dispute that methylamphetamine may be produced by a process which uses P-2-P as a raw material. The contest at trial was whether, as the Crown claimed, the appellant intended to use the P-2-P in the manufacture of methylamphetamine or whether, as the defence claimed, for some other purpose such as the manufacture of opals. In that context Gleeson CJ said at 311: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, as the Crown alleged to be the case here, a person manufactures something with a view to going on to use it in the manufacture of a desired end product then it is normally proper to regard that as a step in the manufacture in the end product. The fact that the process is interrupted at an intermediate stage does not take the case outside the terms of s6 of the Act.” 
         
        
       
     38 Earlier at 310-1 the Chief Justice had said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Activity which may properly be described as the manufacture of a certain product might, in various cases, commence with materials which are themselves in various stages of production or refinement. The end product of a given industry activity, assuming it to be a marketable commodity, might be something which is itself capable of being used as a material in a process of manufacture. However, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case, the production of such a commodity might merely be an intermediate step in a manufacturer’s more extensive process of manufacture. What for one manufacturer is an end product might, for another, be an intermediate, product. Conversely, what might, for one manufacturer, be acquired as a raw material prior to any manufacturing activity might, for another, be a product of a step in the process of manufacture.” 
         
        
       
     39 In this case it seems clear enough that the appellant was removing the Sudafed and other similar tablets from their plastic containers with a view to going on to use them in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. In my opinion, BD should not be treated as determining that a person removing Sudafed or other similar tablets from their containers with the intention of using the contents to manufacture methylamphetamine can never be said to be taking a step in the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine. In Kouroumalos Wood CJ at CL said that the popping of Sudafed tablets and the fetching of other items required for the manufacture of methylamphetamine, aware that the tablets and such items were required for that manufacture, were necessary steps in the operation.  
      
       
     40 In BD the tablets, taken from their packs, were found in the boot of a car being driven along the Hume Highway. The question posed under s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act was whether the trial Judge had erred in law in concluding that “the obtaining and transporting of ingredients” including Sudafed and implements to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine could not constitute taking a step in the process of manufacture. The case was directed to that question. A decision on those facts does not establish a binding principle that in a case such as the present removal of an ingredient from its packet with a view to its use in the production of a prohibited drug is not a step in that process. There is nothing about the factual statement relating to the second, fourth or fifth counts that puts them on all fours with the facts in BD. In my opinion, that decision is no ground for permitting the appellant to change his plea of guilty to the second count. 
      
       
     41 Robert Ellis McCoy, whose presence at the Sylvania Waters premises has already been referred to, was convicted on 3 April 2000 before his Honour Judge Shillington and a jury of a charge that between 1 December 1995 and 30 June 1996 he did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine. On 9 June 2000 he was given a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a period of 1 year. He appealed against his conviction on grounds which included the ground that the learned trial Judge erred in determining that the evidence was capable of proving the offence charged notwithstanding that there was evidence to establish that the offence was incapable of being committed by the appellant in the manner alleged. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld that appeal.  
      
       
     42 Hulme J gave the principal judgement. In the course of it his Honour remarked that despite the extent of the period encompassed by the charge, the matter was put to the jury on the basis of activities being carried on at, and just prior to, the time of the appellant’s arrest on 13 June 1996. The foundation of the appeal lay in the undisputed evidence at the trial that the chemicals being used in the course of an attempt to produce methylamphetamine were incapable of leading to that result. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “15 On those provisions, there must be a process of manufacture of a prohibited drug, here methylamphetamine, in which the offender takes part. The key issue for present purposes is the width of the concept of a process. At its widest, it may begin with the germination of an intention to produce the prohibited drug and ends, perhaps after numerous false starts and failures, with successful production. Narrowly, it may look to a particular attempt to produce the prohibited drug, involving for example the taking of chemicals, their combination and the result of the chemical reaction. 
         
        
        
         
         16 I do not think it necessary to address in the abstract where in the spectrum a process of manufacture of a prohibited drug lies for the purposes of the Act. It is sufficient that in this case the matter was put to the jury on a narrow basis, whereby the process was that under way at and just prior to the time of the Appellant’s arrest. It was at all times impossible for manufacture of methylamphetamine to occur in the course of the attempt at manufacture in which the Appellant was then involved. Those directing the enterprise could have made another attempt using different chemicals, but that would have been a different process of manufacture of methylamphetamine from that put before the jury. It would not have been the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine being carried on at, and just prior to, the time of the Appellant’s arrest. It was not put to the jury that the process in this case extended to the use of different chemicals if the initial attempt was not successful. 
         
        
        
         
         17 In the process as the matter was put to the jury, however genuinely the Appellant may have thought that the chemicals being used when combined made methylamphetamine, it could not realistically be said that the attempt to combine those chemicals was the taking of a step in the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine. To illustrate the point, however genuinely the appellant may have thought that hydrogen and oxygen when combined made methylamphetamine (rather than water) it could not realistically be said that an attempt to combine those elements was the taking of a step in the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine. The chemicals in the present case were just not appropriate for the purpose, and there was no process of manufacture of methylamphetamine.” 
         
        
       
     43 Based principally on the Crown concession that the chemicals being used during the short and discreet time that McCoy was present were incapable of producing methylamphetamine, Mr Thangaraj, who put the appellant’s case in a commendably determined and clear fashion, submitted that the appellant should be permitted to change his pleas on counts 4 and 5.  
      
       
     44 In R v El Azzi [2001] NSWCCA 397 the appellant, the person already referred to in the facts sheet, was alleged to be involved in an enterprise relating to the manufacture of amphetamine. Howie J, who gave the judgment with which Mason P and Levine J agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “10 The second count relates to what is alleged by the Crown to be an attempt to manufacture at Dooralong. Generally the Crown case is that the applicant organised and supervised the manufacture of the drug using a man named Simpson to carry out the manufacturing process. The Crown alleges that, amongst other things, the applicant secured the premises where the manufacture was to take place and obtained the precursors from which the drug was to be manufactured. The venture was interrupted when on 15 April 1996 police raided the premises being used for the manufacture and arrested two alleged co-conspirators, Knight and Phillips. 
         
        
        
         
         11 The allegation in respect of the third count concerns a further attempt by the applicant and others to manufacture methylamphetamine after the police frustrated the attempt at Dooralong. This enterprise commenced at premises in Glenfield but, because of suspected police activity in the area, was moved to Sylvania Waters. The Crown case is that the applicant arranged the premises for the manufacturing of the drug process and supervised the process that was carried out by Simpson. Once again the venture was cut short by the intervention of police. On 13 June 1996 police raided the premises at Sylvania Waters and the applicant was arrested along with Simpson, Hearne, the owner of the premises, and Robert McCoy. 
         
        
        
         
         12 The applicant was initially charged with three counts of knowingly take part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine but, for reasons which will become apparent, those charges were withdrawn in the Local Court on 14 August 1996. There has been some indecision by the Crown since that time as to the charges that should be laid against the applicant. It was not until 7 August of this year that the indictment, which is the subject of these proceedings, was presented to the District Court. The difficulty, which the Crown faces in proving the charges initially laid in respect of Dooralong and Sylvania Waters, is that methylamphetamine could not have been manufactured using the chemicals found at those sites.” 
         
        
       
     45 No concession about the impossibility of manufacture is made by the Crown in this case except so far as one can derive it from page 61 of the stated facts. So far as the Wollombi laboratory site was concerned, which founded the fourth count, it was said that the forensic evidence taken indicated that commercial quantities of methylamphetamine had been produced in the past. So far as the Dooralong site was concerned analysis revealed evidence of methylamphetamine being produced using phenylacetic conversion. Search of the Sylvania Waters laboratory revealed evidence of an attempted methylamphetamine process using a phenylacetic acid conversion. In that case it was said the integrity of the starting precursor material would have prevented this reaction proceeding successfully.  
      
       
     46 By his pleas the appellant admitted the essential ingredients of the offences charged. It was plain that so far as Sylvania Waters was concerned there was no more than an attempt, unsuccessful, to manufacture methylamphetamine. The sentencing Judge raised this with the Crown and counsel for the appellant took no exception to the facts sheet as supporting the charges. 
      
       
     47 In count 4 the offence was alleged to have been committed between 1 December 1995 and 31 January 1997. In count 5 the offence was alleged to have been committed between 1 December 1995 and 30 June 1996. At the beginning of the facts sheet it was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The accused and his close associates, Dennis and Tracie Watkins and Frank Bera, all from the Central Coast, were identified as being intricately involved in the manufacture and distribution of prohibited drugs with Kalache. Their criminal activities were based in Kariong where they resided, and both their premises were monitored by lawfully obtained listening devices and telephone interception at different times during the investigation. Although the accused and the Watkins’ were closely aligned with Kalache, they supplied prohibited drugs separate to the Kalache network.” 
         
        
       
     48 About the fourth and fifth counts it was said that Launt established his backyard hydriodic acid laboratory near Maclean during 1994 and 1995. Hydriodic acid is a reportable substance commonly used to reduce pseudoephedrine to methylamphetamine. In December 1995 Kalache and the appellant contacted Launt and arranged for him to supply 7.5 litres of hydriodic acid for $7,500. In the middle of December 1995 Launt and Kalache arranged for a large supply of further precursor chemicals and reagents for the amount of $35,000. The consignment consisted of the precursor, Phenylacetic acid (40 kilograms), Mannitol (20 kilograms), hydriodic acid (30 litres), sodium acetate (40 kilograms) and caustic soda (40 kilograms). In January 1996 Launt met the appellant and Kalache in Sydney to discuss further supplies and pay some outstanding moneys for the initial supply in December 1995. In February 1996 a further 30 litres of hydriodic acid was supplied and transported to Sydney by commercial carriers. Further requests were made by Kalache to Launt for phenylacetic acid and other reducing agents. Launt and Dolman produced methylammonium chloride, formic acid, acetic anhydride and N-methyl formamide. These products were sold to Kalache, the appellant and Heausler. Additional products supplied included common authentic materials legitimately bought and on-sold by Launt including hydrochloric acid and sodium acetate in their original packaging. 
      
       
     49 During March 1996 Kalache and the appellant purchased 75 kilograms of phenylacetic acid, 40 kilograms of sodium acetate, 80 litres of acetic anhydride and 100 litres of hydrochloric acid. This was delivered to Kalache’s house in Sydney. It was stored at Smithfield in a storeroom rented by the appellant from his neighbour, Joe Vocisano. The appellant also stored a pill press at this address. About the same time the appellant ordered a further identical consignment from Launt of 50 kilograms of phenylacetic acid, 40 kilograms of sodium acetate, 80 litres of acetic anhydride and 100 litres of hydrochloric acid. This was delivered to unknown persons working for Kalache at Peats Ridge. About this time the Wollombi clandestine drug laboratory was established. On 3 April 1996 police discovered the clandestine drug laboratory site and storage area of precursor chemicals at Wollombi. The chemicals located on this property were consistent with the order that was delivered to Peats Ridge. 
      
       
     50 In March 1996 the appellant and Haeusler met Launt twice to establish future supplies of precursor chemicals. Haeusler and the appellant ordered 40 kilograms of phenylacetic acid, 40 litres of acetic anhydride, 20 litres of hydriodic acid and 40 litres of N-methyl formamide. The consignment was transported and arrangements made for the appellant to collect the consignment for Haeusler. 
      
       
     51 Simpson and El Azzi established a clandestine laboratory at a house at Dooralong. On 15 April 1996 police discovered the illicit laboratory active in the bathroom of the premises. This was described in the remarks on sentence. As a result of this seizure, Haeusler, the appellant and Simpson met and an agreement was reached for the further supply of chemicals for another manufacture process to begin. Premises at Glenfield were arranged for use. On 23 April 1996 the local police visited this laboratory site but the laboratory was not detected. It was then decided to move to Sylvania Waters, where the syndicate re-established the clandestine drug laboratory. 
      
       
     52 During July/August 1996 Launt attempted to recover moneys outstanding to him from the appellant and Haeusler. The appellant told him that they had been raided by the police and lost all the phenylacetic acid. Launt was also told he was not being paid because the chemicals supplied “were not any good and they couldn’t do anything with it”. During the rest of 1996 Kalache and the appellant purchased approximately 100 litres of hydriodic acid from Launt at $500 a litre.  
      
       
     53 On 12 May 1998 Launt’s property was searched. There were seized empty imported 40 kilogram phenylacetic acid that contained the product supplied to Kalache in 1995, various drums of home-made phenylacetic acid labelled “PAA” that actually contained benzoic acid, black 20 litre plastic drums of reducing agents with home-made labels and spare printed labels of similar compounds previously supplied by Launt to Kalache, the appellant and Haeusler during 1996. 
      
       
     54 It is in the context of this material that the appellant pleaded guilty to counts 4 and 5. The facts sheet was not challenged. The appellant in his affidavit of 29 July 2002 concedes that he was involved in the acquiring of chemicals but said he was not involved in the cooking process. He said further that he was not aware of any manufacturing process taking place at the time he acquired the chemicals. This last statement by the appellant in his affidavit defies belief and is entirely inconsistent with those parts of the facts sheet that I have set out. I have no hesitation in rejecting it. In my opinion, Judge Woods correctly concluded in his remarks on sentence that the appellant played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. The application to change the pleas to counts 4 and 5 should be rejected. 
      
       
        
        
       Sentence 
        
       
     55 In my opinion, the sentence of 13 years imprisonment imposed for the offence charged in count 1 is excessive and should be quashed. It is appropriate that the Court re-sentence the appellant on this count. Judge Woods sentenced the appellant pursuant to the provisions of the Sentencing Act 1989 as then in force. When this Court re-sentences it is obliged to do so in accordance with s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; see R v Carrion (2000) 49 NSWLR 149. In doing so I am conscious of the seriousness of the charge but take account of the fact that the appellant pleaded guilty to it. I also take account of the seriousness of the charge on the Form 1. This requires that the sentence imposed reflects both the seriousness of the charge for which the appellant is to be sentenced and of the offence to be taken into account; R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152. In this case the seriousness of the Form 1 charge requires that the sentence passed be greater than that which would have been appropriate for the offence charged in count 1 standing alone; compare Vougdis & Rossides v R (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 and see generally R v Perese [2001] NSWCCA 478. I accept that the appellant is entitled to expect that the sentence imposed for the offence taken into account would be less than if it had been separately prosecuted. I take account of the subjective matters related in Judge Woods’ remarks on sentence. As has often been said, such matters are not of high significance in sentencing for an offence of this character. In my opinion, taking account of these matters the appropriate sentence is 9 years imprisonment.  
      
       
     56 Judge Woods said that he had regard to the sequence of events encompassing all the counts as being in a related period in the appellant’s life. He said: “The common factors of associates, the nature of the drug and continuing involvement makes concurrent sentencing appropriate.” I do not regard it as so. In my opinion, in approaching each offence separately and fixing an appropriate sentence for that offence, the question of whether the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative or partially cumulative must take account of the totality of the sentence for all the offences charged. The offence charged in count 1 was for supply of a large commercial quantity. The offences charged in counts 2, 4 and 5 were for manufacture of a large commercial quantity and in count 3 for supply. None of those sentences is challenged. The appropriate overall sentence is achieved by a partial cumulation so that the term of 9 years imprisonment imposed for the offence charged in the first count commences on 10 November 2002, the expiry date of the shortest of the fixed terms imposed, that is to say the term imposed for the offence charged under count 3. It will expire on 9 November 2011.  
      
       
     57 Judge Woods was of the opinion that there were no special circumstances. No reason was given for extending the minimum term beyond 9 years and 9 months to 10 years. The fact that the sentence is now partially cumulative is a special circumstance, which enables the non-parole period to be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. It is appropriate that the Court impose a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 9 November 2008. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     58 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Refuse leave to the appellant to change his pleas to counts 2, 4 and 5; 
         
        
        
         
         2. Quash the sentence imposed on count 1. In lieu thereof sentence the appellant on count 1 to a term of 9 years imprisonment to commence on 10 November 2002 and to expire on 9 November 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 10 November 2002 and expire on 9 November 2008. 
         
        
       
     59 HIDDEN J:  I agree with Sheller JA. 
      
       
     60 HOWIE J: I agree with Sheller JA.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    HIS HONOUR: Following arraignment, but before the empanelling of the jury, a number of matters have been canvassed relating to the admissibility of evidence. I will deal first with the objections to evidence on behalf of the accused Phuong Canh Ngo set out in Ex. X1 on the voir dire. The first objection is to the ballistics evidence of Messrs Roach and Pfoser on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial value. 
    2    The Crown alleges that the murder weapon was a 1935 .32 calibre Beretta pistol recovered from under water at Voyager Point nearly four years later on 10 June 1998 in a rusted condition. Because of such rusted condition no ballistics expert can express a firm opinion as to whether or not the firing pin matched the markings on the spent cartridge cases found at the scene of the killing. 
    3    The objection is taken that, in the absence of firm proof that it is the weapon, the evidence is such that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice within the terms of s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") and it is also objected to on the ground that the evidence of a technical witness, Mr Pfoser, whose methodology will be challenged in a highly technical manner, may be given greater weight than it deserves by the jury because he will be coming all the way from Germany to give his evidence. 
    4    The Crown case in relation to the identity of the weapon is circumstantial. There is evidence that the murder weapon was a .32 calibre pistol and one of the alleged co-offenders, TVT, who will give evidence for the Crown, says that the accused David Dinh had such a weapon in the car on the night of the killing, and there is some evidence that after the shooting it was handed by Dinh to Ngo at a service station. Sergeant Roach is expected to give evidence that the markings on the firing pin found on the rusted pistol recovered at Voyager Point is consistent with the markings on the casings found at the scene. Mr Pfoser says that it was ""more probably than not"" the same firing pin used. There is also evidence of the use of a mobile phone in the possession of the accused Ngo at the relevant time indicating that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. There is evidence of how rare this particular model of gun was generally, and in Australia in particular, and the very unusual pin impression of that model. In addition persons who had handled the gun, such as the witnesses TDN and TVT say, as I understand it, that it was similar to the gun used in earlier attempts on the life of John Newman. 
    5    In my opinion, based on all these matters, taken together, it would be open to the jury to conclude that the weapon used in the shooting was the weapon recovered at Voyager Point. Circumstantial cases do not depend on each individual circumstance, but on the totality of circumstances taken together and each circumstance does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt:  Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 580. Indeed, the fact that this was the murder weapon is itself merely one of the circumstances, and so does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
    6    The fact that one of the experts has travelled from Germany is irrelevant. The jury will have to judge his evidence on its cogency, the data on which it is based, his methodology and its relationship to the other evidence. There is no basis for suggesting that they may give added weight to his opinion because the expert witness comes from overseas. 
    7    Likewise the fact that the defence intends to challenge the witness' methodology on technical grounds is no reason to exclude evidence under ss 137 or 135. It will be the responsibility of counsel to put the questions including the technical ones to the expert witnesses in a form which the jury can understand, and I would expect the State's Senior Crown Prosecutor and its Senior Public Defender would be able to do this. The probative value of the evidence, if accepted, is very high and I cannot see any unfair prejudice to the accused. I will admit the evidence. 
    8    The second matter to which objection is taken is the evidence of PD. There are a number of problems about this evidence and I note that following lengthy argument and submissions, the Crown will not open her evidence and it has been agreed that I should defer ruling on this point. 
    9    The third objection is to the evidence of the reading of the evidence of a witness. In this respect the Crown Prosecutor informs me that he does not now see the need to read the evidence of CC in this trial. CC cannot presently be located and if located the Crown will lead his evidence viva voce and not seek to read it. 
    10    The fourth objection is to the reading of the evidence of Shirley Barrett given in the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. Ms Barrett is now deceased. Her evidence relates to calls from the mobile telephone allegedly in the possession of Ngo on the night of the murder, shortly after the murder, and relates to the alleged disposal by Ngo at Voyager Point of the alleged murder weapon. It is said by the Crown to be relevant for two purposes. She can identify the caller as the accused Ngo, as the result of which, in conjunction with evidence from Telstra regarding the operation of mobile telephone towers, his route and location at that time can be identified, and the Crown claims it can be established that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. 
    11    Moreover, in the second of these conversations the accused Ngo says that he was then on his way home. The Crown intends to prove that he was not on his way home at the time but travelling towards Voyager Point, and seeks to rely on this evidence as a lie showing a consciousness of guilt. 
    12    In my view the evidence is admissible under s 65(3) of the Act and this is conceded by Mr Nicholson SC on behalf of the accused Ngo in relation to the first point, namely, the identification of the caller as the accused Ngo, but he objects to evidence of the content of the second conversation which the Crown seeks to rely on as a lie. 
    13    Before moving on to that point the evidence proposed to be read is the evidence in what has been referred to as the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. The accused Dinh was not an accused in that trial. Consequently his counsel did not have the opportunity to cross-examine, but Mr Hoenig informs me that he does not oppose admission of the evidence against his client if it is otherwise admitted. 
    14    Mr Nicholson's objection to the content of the second conversation said by the Crown to constitute the telling of a lie by the accused Ngo is based on the provisions of s 82(1) of the Act. He submits that evidence of a lie comes within the definition of an ""admission"" as defined in the Dictionary to the Act, being a previous representation adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of proceedings. This point must be conceded. It is established by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442, following R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. 
    15    But he submits that if the evidence is admitted pursuant to s 65 it is not evidence given orally by a person who heard the admission being made. He concedes that if Ms Barrett were still alive and present she could give the evidence, but because she is deceased and her evidence will be adduced by the reading of the deposition under s 65 it is not evidence given orally by her and accordingly, and in light of s 82, it is not admissible. 
    16    That result, absurd as it may seem, may have been the consequence of the Act in its original form when s 82 provided that s 81 did not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it was given orally by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made. But the section was amended by Act No. 53 of 2000, the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, Schedule 1 paragraph 11, which omitted the word ""orally"" from s 82(a) so that section now reads: 
     
      
       
       ""Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made."" 
       
      
      
    17    Ms Barrett was a person who heard the ""admission"" being made. She gives the evidence, although not orally but by deposition under s 65, and accordingly s 82(a) is not applicable, and the whole of her evidence is admissible. 
    18    The object of s 82 both in its original and amended form is to prevent second-hand hearsay. That is not the issue here. The evidence of Ms Barrett is her evidence and it is first hand, and it is given by her, although it was as I say given by deposition and not orally. 
    19    The fifth objection relates to evidence which the Crown Prosecutor informs me will not now be led, so I move on to the sixth objection, which is the leading of evidence in chief from TVT and TDN as to matters affecting their credit only. 
    20    TVT and TDN are accomplice witnesses who have been given indemnities and/or undertakings. It is alleged that they were engaged at various times in the common purpose with the accused Ngo and others to kill John Newman and consequently a warning concerning their evidence will be necessary under s 165. It is conceded that the evidence in chief can include evidence of the giving of the indemnities and/or undertakings.  
    21    I am informed that when they first spoke to the authorities they disclosed some matters of which they now seek to give evidence, but not others. The Crown wishes to lead in chief, evidence from them when they first went to the authorities, and why they did so, and also the reasons for them not disclosing all material information at that stage. The evidence is objected to on the grounds that it is forbidden by s 102 of the Act, the credibility rule. That section at the beginning of Part 3.7 is as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""Evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible.""  
       
      
      
     There follows a number of exceptions including cross-examination as to credibility (s 103) and re-establishing credibility (s 108). 
      
    22    It has often been considered good advocacy for counsel who has a problem witness to confront the problem head-on as early as possible, and if there are going to be questions raised about previous inconsistent statements, to lead evidence as to the reasons or excuses for such inconsistent statements during the evidence in chief, rather than wait for an attack to be made on the witness in cross-examination. However, it would appear that such evidence, strictly speaking, would not be admissible in evidence in chief at common law, and that the position would appear to be reinforced by the provisions of the Act. 
    23    Credibility of a witness is defined in the Dictionary as meaning, ""the credibility of any part or all of the evidence of a witness..."" Although in my experience such evidence has in the past not infrequently been led in these circumstances, the words of the section appear to be clear, and this view is confirmed by the learned authors of Cross on Evidence, Australian edition at para [19005] who state: 
     
      
       
       ""The Cth Evidence Act 1995 and NSW Evidence Act 1995 provide that evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible: s 102. There are exceptions for cross-examination (ss 103-104), for rebuttal of certain denials by a witness (106) and for evidence re-establishing credibility (s 108), but there are no exceptions in relation to evidence in chief, save s110(1) permits an accused person who is testifying to give evidence of good character."" 
       
      
    24    The evidence to which objection is taken falls squarely within the definition and therefore cannot be led except pursuant to the exceptions referred to. Mr Nicholson SC referred to the need for leave under s 108(3) to lead such evidence, even in re-examination; but s 108(1) is in my view quite separate from s 108(3) and if the credit of a witness is attacked, evidence from that witness relating to his credit is admissible in re-examination under s 108(1) without leave. 
    25    The Crown referred me to the judgment of McHugh J in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 151 ALR 616, but that case is distinguishable for two main reasons: firstly, the case was not concerned with leading evidence relating to credibility as evidence in chief but with the cross-examination of an accused as to whether a complainant in the sexual assault case had a motive to lie or fabricate allegations, and secondly, the discussion by his Honour concerning the distinction between evidence relating to facts in issue and evidence only going to credibility was concerned mainly with the finality rule by which other evidence cannot be led to contradict evidence going only to issues of credit, and was concerned with the difficulty in defining the boundary between the two. In any event, his Honour dissented on the relevant issues in the case, and his comments are only dicta. 
    26    I am therefore satisfied that the two witnesses can give evidence in chief that they were charged and at a later stage went to the authorities and were later given indemnities or undertakings but their reasons or motives for going to the police and their previous inconsistent or incomplete statements cannot, or their reasons for such discrepancies cannot, be led as part of their evidence in chief but only in re-examination, provided the anticipated attack on their credit is made. 
    27    The learned Crown Prosecutor therefore then submits that he would seek to refer to these matters in his opening address. Mr Nicholson SC, supported by Mr Cusack SC for the accused Dao, objects and submits that they are not proper matters for an opening and will take away the ""thunder"" of the defence attack. I can see no valid objection to the course proposed by the Crown. The object of the opening is to outline the Crown case to the jury so that they will understand the Crown case as individual witnesses are called. 
    28    It is clearly proper for the Crown to tell the jury that they are alleged accomplices, that the jury will be warned that their evidence may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable in that context. I cannot see any reason why the Crown cannot say that their credibility will be attacked and that one of the anticipated grounds of the attack will be that initially they only told the authorities part of their current evidence, but that they will give reasons for that and for later going further and what those reasons were. 
    29    Evidence intended to be led by the Crown in re-examination (to rebut a telegraphed attack on the credibility of an intended witness) is just as much evidence to be led by the Crown as evidence intended to be led from the witnesses in chief. There is no principle of which I am aware, and I have not been referred to any authority, to the effect that the defence is entitled to the tactical advantage or ""thunder"" of first raising the issue of credibility of a witness. The issue of their credibility will be raised by the need for a warning concerning their evidence under s 165, and the evidence will all be before the jury at some stage. However I am also satisfied that the Crown should deal with these matters only in general terms and not proceed too far into the specifics of the differences in the various statements, but merely that there were differences, and it is anticipated that they will give explanations for such discrepancies in due course. 
    30    The seventh objection relates to the Crown allegedly making continual requests for the non-publication orders in the presence of the jury. The matter has been resolved and the Crown has indicated that he will make such applications in the absence of the jury. 
    31    The eighth objection is to the Crown making any reference in its opening or in evidence in chief to Lucy Wang which seems to seeks to impute her credit insofar as her initial observations of the motor vehicle used by the gunman to escape the scene. 
    32    I am informed that Lucy Wang will give evidence that the deceased's assailant got into the front seat of a dark green car. TVT says that he was a passenger in the vehicle and that the assailant, whom he identifies as the accused Dinh, got into the near side rear seat. The objection apparently is to Ms Wang saying that she thought he got into the front seat, when her evidence will be that he got into the front passenger seat. Apparently the front near side door of Dao's car did not work, and so he could not have got into the front passenger seat, if it was Dao's car, as alleged. 
    33    The other objection is to the Crown proffering a suggestion as to why she might have got it wrong, such as shock, et cetera. 
    34    I must say this all seems rather trivial and nitpicking to me but defence counsel assure me that it is of ""crucial importance"". The Crown has indicated that he will not open to the jury that she ""thought"" that the assailant got into the front seat, and will not proffer a comment as to how she may have been affected by shock, although of course he reserves the right in his closing address to make any comments properly available to him in the light of the evidence at that stage. 
    35    The ninth objection is to the Crown relying on any evidence from TDN or TVT of any activities or conversation which is not in furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise between them and Phuong Canh Ngo. As a general proposition this objection is clearly valid, but the objection is taken to specific pieces of the evidence which is claimed do not come within the furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise. 
    36    The first piece of evidence objected to is summarised at p 51 of the transcript of this hearing and relates to evidence from the witness TDN of a nocturnal visit to his premises, so it is said, by the accused Ngo, who takes TDN from his bed and drives him to the vicinity of the Mekong Club where TDN is requested to remain in the car whilst Ngo speaks to Dinh and TVT some distance away from the car, they both being employees of the Mekong Club. At the conclusion of that conversation Ngo returns to the car and returns the witness TDN to his home. 
    37    This is evidence of association between some of those allegedly involved in the common purpose, and it is also evidence that TDN was prepared to do Ngo's bidding, to get out of bed and to sit in a car and then go home, all as directed by Ngo and for no apparent purpose. 
    38    It was submitted that there may be an innocent explanation for it all and that may be so; but prima facie it is unusual conduct on the part of both Ngo and TDN. There is no evidence that Dinh was involved in the common purpose at that stage. I am satisfied that the evidence is admissible against Ngo and Dao, and Dinh is entitled to have the jury warned that there is no evidence of his involvement in any common purpose at that stage. 
    39    The next objection relates to evidence from TVT and TDN of a conversation, or possibly two conversations between them, when each of them says to the other words to the effect that Ngo had asked him to kill John Newman (or to kill someone). Mr Nicholson SC concedes that each of them may give evidence of the conversation in which Ngo made the request to the witness, but submits that they cannot give evidence that they told each other of the request. 
    40    This meeting, or these meetings, were when they discussed getting a gun, and he rightly concedes that that part of the conversation is in alleged furtherance of the common purpose but he submits that this reference to Ngo's request is not, and cannot be, in furtherance of the common purpose, but is merely narrative of what has already occurred. 
    41    TDN's version of the conversation is set out in the current transcript at p 61. 
    42    True it is neither of them expressly says that the reason he wants to get a gun is because Ngo has asked him to kill someone, but in the context of the conversation the implication is at least open, if not irresistible, that the reason that he wanted a gun was to help Ngo kill John Newman; and other evidence shows that the gun or guns, when purchased, were passed on to Ngo, and the Crown claims that one of the guns purchased by these two accomplices, or either of them (it does not matter for present purposes) was in fact the murder weapon.  
    43    Both the witnesses were working for Ngo, both were involved in the common purpose with him, but this is the first time, as I understand the Crown case, that they came together to join in the common purpose with each other, the reference to Ngo's request was part of the process of them sounding each other out, and the passage objected to identifies the common purpose in which they joined with each other, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman.  
    44    People do not seek to buy guns for no reason and this conversation in its context identifies the reason why they wanted to buy the guns. Stripped to its bare essentials the conversation amounts to this,  
     
      
       
       A says B wants me to help him kill X. A says do you know where I can get a gun?  
       
      
      
     Obviously in this context he wants a gun to help B kill X.  
      
    45    TVT's version is somewhat different. It is set out in the transcript at p 64, and puts that part of the conversation objected to after they had got the gun, that is the gun they have got at Ngo's instigation, but then they discussed the ultimate object of the common purpose, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman. That discussion as to the object of the common purpose would in my view be in furtherance of such common purpose and identifies the common purpose. I will admit both versions of the conversation. 
    46    The tenth and eleventh objections relate to portions of the ERISPs of the accused Ngo and the giving of evidence by video link. It is agreed that both of these matters may be resolved without the necessity for me giving a ruling thereon, and they can in any event be deferred for the time being. 
    47    In addition, Mr Hoenig, counsel for the accused David Dinh, seeks a ruling in advance that certain evidence identified in the schedule to his written submissions is not admissible against his client. That evidence may be described in general terms as evidence of declarations and acts of the others said and done prior to 5 September 1994 in furtherance of what the Crown alleges was common purpose to kill John Newman at the instigation of Phuong Ngo. Mr Hoenig submits that as his client is charged as a principal in the first degree, as the actual shooter, rules relating to criminal complicity such as common purpose and the associated evidentiary rules under which the acts and declarations of each of the participants in furtherance of the common purpose are admissible against each of them are not relevant. 
    48    These issues have already been canvassed before me in an application to set aside an order for a separate trial. R v Ngo, Dao, Dinh [2000] NSWSC 964, and in the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal from that decision [2000] NSWCCA 536. The Court noted they were only interlocutory judgments, as is the present one. 
    49    As I said at para [40] in my earlier judgment,  
     
      
       
       ""It follows that the acts and declarations of the other alleged participants in the common purpose are admissible to prove the nature of the enterprise, not the accused Dinh's participation in it"",  
       
      
      
     and I referred to a number of cases. 
      
    50    This statement of principle was upheld by the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [52], and it was also said at para [49]: 
     
      
       
       ""The fact that a person enters into a joint criminal enterprise at a time after the enterprise has already commenced does not mean that the joint enterprise changes its nature or that a new joint enterprise commences merely by reason of the involvement of the new person in that enterprise. Nor is evidence of what occurred during the course of the enterprise before the person entered into it necessarily inadmissible against the person lately joining the enterprise."" 
       
      
      
       
      
     and their Honours referred to 
       
     R v Bilick and Stark 
      (1984) 11 A Crim R 452 at 462. The Court of Criminal Appeal also pointed out at para [54] that the admissibility of the evidence does not depend on the part played by the particular accused in the joint enterprise, for example, as principal in the first or second degree or accessory etc.  
      
    51    Although the Crown case against the accused Dinh depends on the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he actually fired the fatal shots, the fact that the Crown has no evidence that he joined the enterprise prior to 4 September 1994 does not render the previous acts and declarations of the other participants in the common purpose inadmissible against him; although as both the Court of Criminal Appeal and myself have emphasised it is only admissible to show the nature of the common purpose and not admissible to show the participation in it of the accused Dinh. This latter element must be proved by other evidence. 
    52    The evidence is admissible on this basis but the accused Dinh is entitled to a clear direction to the jury of this limitation on the use of such evidence. 
    53    Moreover, a lot of evidence proposed to be led of events prior to 5 September 1994 is also admissible against Dinh on another basis, namely to show the surrounding circumstances in which it is alleged he was recruited by Ngo to carry out the killing. 
    54    Evidence of surrounding circumstances is generally relevant to show why parties may have acted as they did, to put the facts in their context and to enable a proper understanding of the evidence e.g. Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334; Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 630; R v Dinh in the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [56]. 
    55    Such evidence is often relevant in cases of sexual assaults, as evidence of events taken in isolation may seem incredible, but understood in the context of the surrounding circumstances and other events, they take on a very different quality: R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708. 
    56    Just as shootings do not occur in a vacuum, recruitment of shooters does not occur in a vacuum. As the Crown case is that Dinh acted at the request of Ngo it is correctly conceded that evidence that Ngo had a motive to have John Newman killed is relevant and admissible. 
    57    In my opinion evidence tending to show that Ngo had expressed a desire to have him killed, that he had requested TDN to shoot him and that he had asked TVT to find him a shooter, that he had arranged the purchase of guns for the purpose and had possession of at least one of the guns, that he had instigated three previous unsuccessful attempts on Newman's life, that he was seen driving in the streets near Newman's house two nights before the killing, and that persons previously recruited to carry out the killing had either withdrawn or proved incompetent is all relevant to show the circumstances in which Dinh was allegedly recruited.  
    58    Ngo had (according to the Crown) the motive, the guns, the address, the car, and everything except the shooter. Those facts rendered it more likely that he would, on 5 September 1994 try to obtain a shooter, and therefore more likely that a shooter would be recruited. Without those facts the jury might wonder why he would recruit a shooter at the last minute and therefore consider it less likely that Dinh or anyone else would be recruited. The evidence is such that if accepted it could rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, namely the recruitment of Dinh into the enterprise. It is therefore relevant (s 55) and admissible (s 56). 
    59    For these reasons I am satisfied that most, if not all of such evidence is admissible to show the circumstances that existed at the time the Crown alleges Dinh was recruited by Ngo to shoot Newman. It is also admissible to show the nature of the enterprise which Dinh allegedly joined, but not to show that he did join it or participate in it. There may be some pieces of the evidence in the schedule which go to neither of these issues, and I would be prepared to consider them separately when the time came. 
    60    Subject to that I will admit the evidence indicated against the accused Dinh. 
    61    HIS HONOUR: The other point was the character evidence and Mr Cusack I understand you to be happy to defer that for the time being? 
     
     CUSACK: Yes your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: On 8 August 2005, following a trial by judge alone in the District Court both appellants were convicted on an indictment that charged them jointly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That … that [they] on 5 July 2002 at Taree in the State of New South Wales did have in their possession a precursor intended by them for use in the manufacture by them or another person of a prohibited drug.” 
        
       
      
    2 The appellants were duly sentenced. Each now appeals against her conviction. Neither seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 The charge was brought under s24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “24A Possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs 
         
         
        (1) A person who has possession of a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
       
      A “precursor” is defined as a substance specified or described in regulations made pursuant to the Act as a precursor for the purposes of this section. It was not in issue that the substance the Crown alleged was in the possession of the appellants came within that definition. 
       
      
    4 The facts alleged by the Crown were in relatively narrow compass. The Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    5 The appellants are mother (Franklin) and daughter (Jackwitz). Both were resident in Queensland. On 26 June 2002, driving a utility the rear of which was covered with a hard fibreglass canopy, they travelled from Queensland to New South Wales, stopping at various pharmacies. At each of at least 14 pharmacies they purchased, in small quantities, medications, the common element of which was that they contained pseudoephedrine. 
     
      
    6 In a notebook (exhibit G) and diary (exhibit B) either or both of the appellants kept records of their purchases, together with a note of the profit they anticipated making on disposing of the medications. On 5 July 2002 Jackwitz drove the vehicle to a Taree pharmacy. Franklin purchased a packet of sinus and nasal medication. The pharmacist alerted police to the activities of the appellants. Police stopped the vehicle and searched it. In the rear of the utility they found a garbage bag which contained a large number of bubble-packed sheets of packets of medications of three different kinds. In the front of the vehicle they found more of the medications in the glove box. Also in the vehicle was located the notebook and diary mentioned above. 
     
      
    7 In all, the tablets in the possession of the appellants contained 347.1 grams of pseudoephedrine-hydrochloride. 
     
      
    8 Also found in the vehicle were receipts for the medications in the name of Jackwitz. Others were located in the handbags of the two appellants. 
     
      
       
      the trial 
       
      
    9 By notice of motion dated 6 December 2004 each applicant sought an order that the indictment be quashed upon the ground that it was bad for duplicity. Having heard argument on the question, Payne DCJ dismissed the notice of motion, holding that the indictment did not suffer from the defect of duplicity. 
     
      
    10 Evidence was given in the trial by two Taree pharmacists, each of whom asserted that Franklin had entered the pharmacy and purchased medications containing pseudoephedrine. Both, obviously suspicious, reported the purchases to police. It was as a consequence of these notifications that the appellants’ vehicle was stopped and searched. 
     
      
    11 Evidence was also given by various police officers involved, and expert evidence was given by Detective Inspector Willingham; and a statement of a police forensic scientist, Mr William Allender, was tendered. 
     
      
    12 There are two essential elements to the charge under s24A: 
     
      
       
      (i) possession of a precursor; 
       
      (ii) intention that the precursor be used, either by the accused person, or by another person, in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    13 In relation to Jackwitz, in the circumstances there could have been, and was, no issue as to the first element, of possession, which was conclusively established by the direct evidence. That was not so in relation to Franklin, whose position was that the substance was in the exclusive possession of Jackwitz. The Crown sought to prove the intention of the appellants by circumstantial evidence. The circumstances included the repeated purchases, at different pharmacies in a wide variety of locations, of the medications; the recording in the notebook and diary of the purchases; the recording of the anticipated profit; and the quantity of the substance found in their possession. 
     
      
    14 Neither appellant gave evidence. Jackwitz argued, in effect, that the Crown had failed to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that her possession (which was not disputed) of the substance was for the relevant purpose. Franklin argued that the Crown had failed to prove that she had possession of the substance. 
     
      
    15 The trial judge, Payne DCJ, declared herself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two appellants were part of a joint (criminal) enterprise and were in joint possession of all of the medication found in the vehicle. She held that the only inference available on the evidence was that each appellant intended the precursor to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, either by herself, or by another person. 
     
      
    16 Accordingly, she convicted each of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 Initially, each appellant pleaded six grounds of appeal. These were in identical terms, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The conviction of the appellant be quashed upon the ground that the charge upon which she was convicted was bad for duplicity. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence at the conclusion of the prosecution case disclosed a  
        prima facie 
         case or a case requiring the appellant to be called upon to answer. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in law in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution case. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence was capable of satisfying her, as tribunal of fact, of the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        5. That the trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence established the intent of the appellant as charged, viz; possession with intent for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
        
       
       
        
        6. That the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion and the application of s138  
        Evidence Act [1995] 
         by admitting over objection the evidence of the stopping, detention and search of the motor vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    18 On the appeal, each appellant abandoned reliance upon ground 6. Franklin sought and was granted leave to amend the notice of appeal by adding a further ground, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. Error of law in finding that the appellant was in joint possession of a prohibited drug.” 
        
       
       
      ground 1 
       
      
    19 Both at first instance and on appeal the argument put in relation to duplicity focused upon that part of the indictment which asserted possession of the precursor, intended by the appellants: 
     
      
       
        
        “… for use in the manufacture  
        by them or another person 
        ”  
         
        (italics added) 
        
       
       
      of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    20 The argument advanced was that, in framing s24A as it did, the legislature intended to create at least four different offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) possession of the precursor for the purpose of the manufacture of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (b) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (c) possession of a precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession; 
       
      (d) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession. 
       
      
    21 Duplicity in an indictment occurs where the charge, as stated, properly construed, charges the accused with having committed two or more separate offences: see Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 44th Edition (1995), Vol 1, p75, cited in Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; 188 CLR 77 at 84. The essence of the appellants’ argument is that, by incorporating in a single charge an allegation that the appellants had possession of the precursor for manufacture of a prohibited drug either by themselves, or by another person, two separate offences were incorporated – that is, the offence of possession for the purpose of manufacture by themselves; and possession of the precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by some other person. 
     
      
    22 In support of the argument counsel relied upon what was described as an “enlightening” decision of the English Court of Appeal in Mallon v Allen [1964] 1 QB 385, it being submitted (in written submissions) that the effect of that case was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where an indictment alleging a person had been ‘permitted or allowed’ to remain on premises was held to be bad, on the basis that two offences were alleged.” 
        
       
      
    23 The submission significantly misstates what was held in that case. The statute there under consideration provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “No person who is apparently under the age of 18 years … shall be admitted to or allowed to remain on those premises …” 
        
       
      
    24 It can readily be seen that that statutory provision clearly created offences of two different characters, constituted by two different acts: admitting a person under the age of 18 years to licensed premises; and allowing a person under the age of 18 years to remain upon licensed premises. The conduct in each case is quite different. In the one case it is admitting a person of the prohibited age into licensed premises; in the other it is allowing a person of relevant age already in the licensed premises to remain there. It is the conduct which is the gist of the offence. 
     
      
    25 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the High Court in Walsh v Tattersall. In that case, a single charge was brought under a statute which made an offence of obtaining by dishonest means any payment or other benefit under the statute. The defendant, Walsh, was charged with obtaining a series of payments or benefits by dishonest means. The payments or benefits were particularised. 
     
      
    26 It was there argued that the count was bad for duplicity as alleging a number of separate offences. Dawson and Toohey JJ rejected the argument. Their Honours noted that the prosecution case was not of a series of separate dishonest pretences, but that, as a result of, effectively, a single dishonest pretence, Walsh received multiple payments or benefits. The gist of the offence was the act of dishonesty in making a false pretence. 
     
      
    27 Gaudron and Gummow JJ decided the case on what they described as “an anterior question”, and did not deal with the duplicity issue. Kirby J was of the opinion that the count was bad for duplicity. 
     
      
    28 The decision is of only the most marginal relevance. There is nothing in Walsh v Tattersall that throws any light on the present issue. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants must fail. The essential element of the offence charged is possession of the precursor, accompanied by the relevant intention. It is not essential to the proof of that charge that the person in possession have a specific intent as to the identity of the individual or individuals who will manufacture or produce the prohibited drug; that is merely incidental. It may well be that an offender has possession of a precursor with intent that it be made into a prohibited drug without a final intention as to by whom the prohibited drug is to be made. 
     
      
    30 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 
       
      
    31 Grounds 2 and 3 are essentially the same ground – that the trial judge was in error in holding that the Crown had established a prima facie case. Ground 4 and 5 are an extension of those grounds, that the evidence was insufficient to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    32 The argument put on behalf of Jackwitz was that the Crown had failed to exclude the possibility that the appellants had purchased the medication for resale for profit, purely as medication. Senior counsel sought to draw comfort from the evidence of the notebook, concerning the anticipated profits. 
     
      
    33 The trial judge drew an inference, from evidence to which I have already referred, that the intention of both appellants was the manufacture of a prohibited drug. In my opinion that inference was amply available to her. Indeed, the alternative inference, proposed on behalf of Jackwitz, is entirely without any foundation in the evidence, and well beyond the bounds of rationality. I am satisfied that her Honour made no error in finding that the Crown had established a prima facie case, in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution, nor in proceeding to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the intention of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      ground 7: joint possession 
       
      
    34 This ground was advanced only on behalf of Franklin. Reliance was placed on her behalf on R v Amanatidis [2001] NSWCCA 400; R v GNN [2000] SASC 447; and R v Filippetti (1984) 13 A Crim R 335. It may be accepted that, emerging from these authorities, knowledge of the presence of a prohibited substance is not sufficient to establish possession; the Crown must establish that the prohibited substance is not in the exclusive possession of another person; and must establish physical control and an intention to exercise control over it. These are unremarkable propositions. 
     
      
    35 They do not address the issue raised on the evidence. I do not propose to restate that evidence in great detail. Both appellants were present in the vehicle over a number of days. The evidence was that Franklin, on at least two occasions, entered the pharmacies and purchased the substances. It was open to the trial judge to draw an inference, as she did, that the two appellants were party to a joint criminal enterprise. From there it is an obvious inference that they were in joint possession of the substance. 
     
      
    36 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I propose that, in each case, the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    38 BARR J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    39 HOEBEN J: I agree with Simpson J.

The challenge was brought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).  The parts by which limited success was achieved by the appellant are not the subject of any cross-appeal.  2    The introduction to the primary judge’s reasons succinctly encapsulated the nature and difficulty of the case confronting his Honour as follows:1    This matter concerns a scenario that is all too frequently encountered when search warrants are employed to facilitate the investigation of complex commercial or tax-related criminal offences.  That scenario involves three potentially problematic features.  The first feature is the issue and utilisation of so called “three condition” search warrants which define the object of the search in a broad, non-specific fashion.  The warrants are often lengthy, overly complex and, regrettably, sometimes poorly drafted.  The second feature is that the execution of the warrants is frequently, and unavoidably, carried out by teams of officers, many of whom have had little or no past involvement in the relevant investigation.  The officers accordingly have little or no background knowledge or experience to assist them in the often complex and difficult task of executing the warrants.  That frequently results in the execution of the warrants in a manner which is apt to create the perception, at least, that the officers do not really know what they should be searching for or seizing, and are instead simply seizing anything that looks even remotely like it might be relevant to the investigation.  The third feature is that the execution of the warrants these days almost invariably involves the search and seizure of computer equipment and electronic data storage devices.  [Those] circumstances [require] the executing officers, or forensic officers who are assisting them, to navigate the labyrinthine statutory provisions that deal with the search and seizure of such items.  2    The confluence of these three features often results in a judicial review challenge, by the occupier of the premises that were the subject of the warrants, or persons otherwise affected by the execution of the warrants (usually the target of the criminal investigation), to both the issue and execution of the warrants in question.  Orders are generally sought for the return of the items said to have been unlawfully seized.  Frequently that comprises a vast quantity of material.3    That is what has occurred in this matter.Overview3    On 27 January 2015, search warrants in respect of six premises and two motor vehicles were obtained by officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in aid of a joint tax fraud investigation being conducted with officers of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in Western Australia.  The search warrants were issued by a magistrate in Perth, acting administratively as an “issuing officer”, upon the basis of an affidavit sworn by one of the AFP officers on 23 January 2015.  Execution of those search warrants commenced on 28 January 2015.  A significant quantity of material was seized over the course of three days.  A further search warrant was later issued on 4 March 2017, based upon an affidavit which annexed the prior affidavit and provided additional information.  That further search warrant was executed on 5 March 2017. 4    On 4 February 2015, the principal natural person who was the target of the investigation, Allen Caratti, commenced judicial review proceedings in this Court against the Commissioner of the AFP, challenging the lawfulness of the issue of the search warrants, their validity on their face, and their execution.  The Court was informed by counsel for the Commissioner that the seized material has not been examined pursuant to an undertaking given to Mr Caratti.  Accordingly, this aspect of the investigation has stalled pending the outcome of these proceedings, giving rise to a delay of well over two and a half years.  5    Following an extended trial over six days before the primary judge, involving numerous witnesses and detailed submissions from the parties, the primary judge reserved and subsequently delivered a lengthy and detailed judgment.  Although no adverse findings were made by his Honour as to the honesty or moral propriety of the officers involved, substantial criticisms were levelled against the poor drafting of the search warrants, going well beyond the introductory comments by his Honour reproduced above.  6    Despite the criticisms of the primary judge, Mr Caratti’s application mostly failed.  Only limited findings were made as to the unlawfulness of seizure of certain items of electronic equipment.  This reflected a failure by the AFP to comply with the legislative scheme, which mandates a particular process for copying and examining data on electronic equipment, and special conditions for seizure of the equipment itself where copying is impracticable.  Although orders were made for the return of the relevant electronic devices, his Honour also made ancillary orders permitting the data on the hardware to be copied before that equipment was returned, and for the copied data to be examined and potentially used by the AFP, in the manner contemplated by the legislative scheme, for the purposes of the investigation.  The declarations and orders made by his Honour are reproduced below.7    The conclusions reached by the primary judge leading to the dismissal of most of the judicial review challenge were conveniently summarised at the end of his Honour’s comprehensive reasons as follows: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 481    Following is a brief summary of the findings and conclusions relevant to Mr Caratti’s challenge to the issue and execution of the search warrants.482    The search warrants were validly issued.  The information before the issuing officer was sufficient to support a finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was, at the relevant premises, things with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that they would afford evidence as to the commission of the offences set out in the third condition of the warrants.  Mr Caratti has not proved otherwise.  The search permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was justified by the material before the issuing officer.  These findings are subject to the finding in relation to the storage medium paragraph.483    The search warrants were valid on their face.  The warrants sufficiently specified the perimeters within which materials were able to be searched for and seized.  They were capable of sufficiently informing the occupiers of the relevant premises of the authorised area of search and seizure.  While the descriptions of the offences to which the warrants related, in the third condition of the warrants, were poorly drafted and, to a certain extent, lacked clarity and particularity, they were nonetheless sufficient for the purposes of a search warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act.  These findings are also subject to the finding in relation to the storage medium paragraph. 484    The storage medium paragraph in the warrants (the three lines after the third condition) was invalid.  It purported to authorise the seizure of electronic devices (as opposed to the data stored on them) that did not comprise evidential material and in circumstances where the condition in s 3L(3)(a) was not satisfied.  The storage medium paragraph is, however, able to be severed from the warrants.  That paragraph did not form part of an inseparable context and, if the paragraph was severed, the warrants would not operate differently or produce different results from that which was intended.  To the extent that any items may have been seized in reliance on this paragraph, the seizure of those items was appropriately dealt with in the context of Mr Caratti’s specific challenge to the seizure of those items. 485    The warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms. They were not unreasonably or excessively executed by the executing officers or constables assisting.  These findings are subject to the findings concerning the seizure of individual items comprising computers or electronic storage devices or equipment.486    A number of items of electronic equipment were unlawfully seized.  Those items were the Compaq and Toshiba laptops seized at the Cornish Turn premises; the external hard drives seized by Mr Khan at the Wickham Street premises; the Seagate and Imation storage devices seized by Mr Ilett at the Wickham Street premises; and the Strontium and TDK storage devices seized at the Duncraig Road premises.  Those items (as opposed to the data stored on them) did not constitute evidential material as specified in the warrants.  There were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the items (as opposed to the data stored on them) would afford evidence of the offences specified in the warrants.  No seizing officer formed the view that there were such reasonable grounds.  Seizure was therefore not authorised by s 3F(1)(c) of the Act.  Nor were the items able to be seized under s 3L(2)(a) because the condition or circumstances in s 3L(3)(a) was not satisfied.  There was nothing to suggest that it was not practicable to copy the data on these devices.  No seizing officer formed the view that it was impracticable to copy the data.487    The Court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, order the return of the items of electronic equipment that have been found to have been unlawfully seized until the Commissioner, through his officers, is given an opportunity to further inspect and, if satisfied in terms of s 3L(1A), copy the data pursuant to s 3L(1A)(a) of the Act.  The items should then be returned.  The further inspection and copying of the data should occur within a reasonable time and (if Mr Caratti so requests) in the presence of Mr Caratti or his representatives.  The parties should have leave to have the matter relisted if any dispute arises in relation to the further inspection of the equipment and the copying of the data.8    The final declarations and orders made by the primary judge on 23 November 2016 were as follows (omitting definitions and explanatory notes):THE COURT DECLARES THAT:1.    The words which appear immediately after the third condition of the warrants which read “Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things” (the storage medium paragraph) are invalid.2.    The storage medium paragraph is severable from the balance of the warrants.3.    The electronic devices listed in Annexure A to these orders (the electronic devices) were not lawfully seized pursuant to either s 3F or s 3L of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) on the execution of the warrants.THE COURT ORDERS THAT:1.    The first respondent (or an officer or officers authorised to do so on his behalf) may inspect the copies made, subsequent to the execution of the warrants, of the data contained on the respective electronic devices identified in paragraphs 1-4 of Annexure A to these orders and, if he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that any data within any of the respective copies satisfies the three conditions of the warrants, retain the copied data from the respective electronic device.2.    The further inspection of the data pursuant to order 1 above should (unless otherwise ordered) occur within 28 days of the date of these orders (unless another period is agreed between the parties) and in the presence of the applicant or his or her authorised representative (if the applicant so requests). For this purpose, the first respondent (or an officer authorised to do so on his behalf) shall liaise with the applicant to determine a mutually convenient time (or times) within the period of 28 days from the date of these orders.3.    Upon completion of the steps set out in orders 1 – 2 above:3.1    the electronic devices referred to in paragraphs 1-3 of Annexure A be returned to the occupier of the premises from which the electronic devices were seized; and3.2    unless the first respondent is entitled to retain the copied data as set out in order 1 above, the copied data shall be removed from any device in the control of the Australian Federal Police and destroyed as soon as practicable.4.    If the first respondent is satisfied that the data retained as provided in order 1 above is not required (or is no longer required) for a purpose mentioned in section 3ZQU of the Act or for other judicial or administrative review proceedings, the first respondent must arrange for:4.1    the removal of the data from any device in the control of the Australian Federal Police; and4.2    the destruction of any other reproduction of the data in the control of the Australian Federal Police.5.    Leave is granted to the parties to have the matter relisted on 24 hours’ notice if any dispute arises in relation to the matters provided for in orders 1-4 above.6.    The applicant’s Second Further Amended Originating Application and the claims in the Applicant’s Further Amended Points of Claim are otherwise dismissed.7.    The applicant pay 75% of the first respondent’s costs as agreed or assessed on an ordinary basis.8.    The applicant pay the third respondent’s costs as agreed or assessed on an ordinary basis.9    On 2 December 2016, Mr Caratti appealed from the orders made by the primary judge, including in respect of his Honour’s declaration as to the severability of a portion of the warrant, and as to the orders permitting copying and inspection of the data on the electronic devices found to be unlawfully seized.  He sought, as he did in the Court below, to have the search warrants set aside and all of the seized material returned.  Even if the outcome of the appeal were to result in findings only of partial invalidity, he contended that this should not result in severance and that all of the seized material should be returned.  As a final alternative, he contended that the use of any material permitted to be retained should be restricted.  The Commissioner defended the primary judge’s reasons and conclusions without qualification.  In doing so, the criticisms and adverse conclusions as to the search process were not challenged.10    In substance, Mr Caratti revisited the case as was ultimately run in the Court below, with a number of key initial grounds having been abandoned before the primary judge.  He asserted error in relation to the key findings of the primary judge on the grounds that were litigated to conclusion.  In those circumstances, it is important to keep in mind that while this appeal was a rehearing, the finding of error on the part of his Honour was indispensable.  It is not enough that this Full Court would have reached a different conclusion on any topic that was fairly open to his Honour: see the restatement of the rehearing principles in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Reckitt Benckiser (Australia) Pty Ltd [2016] FCAFC 181; 340 ALR 25 at [44]-[56], especially at [50].11    Mr Caratti advanced five grounds of appeal, the full text of which is reproduced as each is considered below, asserting that the primary judge erred in:(1)    concluding that the “perimeters” of the search areas specified in the warrants were sufficiently precise, an argument that turned on the description given to the suspected offences in the search warrants;(2)    finding that the search perimeters permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer, again turning on the offence description as compared to the information in the affidavit relied upon to obtain the search warrants;(3)    considering that an offence in the third condition of the warrants might be severable;(4)    finding that the warrants were lawfully executed; and(5)    permitting the further copying and examination of data copied from electronic equipment that was found to have been unlawfully seized.12    For the reasons that follow, each ground of appeal should fail and, accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.  The conclusions by which the primary judge arrived at the declarations and orders reproduced at [8] above, while being far from inevitable, were fairly available to his Honour.  The necessary error has not been established in any respect.  That conclusion is reached having regard to:(1)    the terms of the search warrants and supporting affidavit construed by his Honour in the confined manner required for the purposes of judicial review of administrative action;(2)    the evidence before his Honour, including significant cross-examination and involving credit assessments, having regard also to the onus on the appellant;(3)    the terms of the legislation, properly interpreted; and (4)    the substantial body of authority guiding the determination of the various challenges made.13    The ultimate success of the Commissioner in this litigation is cause for sober reflection, rather than complacent satisfaction.  The primary judge’s criticisms as to the drafting of the search warrants have been endorsed and enlarged upon at the conclusion of these reasons, with further views expressed as to the steps that might be taken in the future to avoid the delays, problems and issues in this case that have been caused or compounded by the deficiencies in the process.Legislative scheme – Part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 14    The relevant power to issue a search warrant under the Crimes Act arises from s 3E, although it is to be read in light of several collateral provisions.  In summary terms, under s 3E(1) it is open to an issuing officer to issue a search warrant if the information provided on oath or affirmation is capable of satisfying him or her of the substance of the two limbs required, namely, that:(1)    there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, at the relevant premises;(2)    anything with respect to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of the offence or offences to which the warrant relates.15    The details in the legislation leading to the above summary overview require more detailed exposition.  The provisions reproduced below provide a comprehensive regime for the application for a search warrant, its issue, and the powers it bestows, including additional powers granted by statute collateral to a valid warrant’s express scope.16    Sections 3E(1), (5) and (6) of the Crimes Act are in the following terms:3E    When search warrants can be issued(1)    An issuing officer may issue a warrant to search premises if the officer is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.…(5)    If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant:(a)    the offence to which the warrant relates; and(b)    a description of the premises to which the warrant relates or the name or description of the person to whom it relates; and(c)    the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and(d)    the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and(e)    the time at which the warrant expires (see subsection (5A)); and(f)    whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours....(6)    The issuing officer is also to state, in a warrant in relation to premises:(a)    that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (5)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:(i)    evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or(ii)    a thing relevant to another offence that is an indictable offence; or(iii)    evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act);if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevents its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence; and(b)    whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.…17    The expression “evidential material” used in various parts of s 3E is defined in s 3C as meaning “a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form”.  The expression “thing relevant to an indictable offence” is further defined in s 3 as follows:thing relevant to a summary offence means:(a)    either of the following:(i)    anything with respect to which a summary offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed;(ii)    anything with respect to which a State offence that has a federal aspect, and that is a summary or simple offence against the law of that State, has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; or(b)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or(c)    anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence.18    The scope of the authorisation conferred by a search warrant issued under s 3E is relevantly set out in s 3F of the Crimes Act as follows:3F    The things that are authorised by a search warrant(1)    A warrant that is in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a constable assisting:(a)    to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a conveyance, to enter the conveyance, wherever it is; and(b)    to search for and record fingerprints found at the premises and to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes; and(c)    to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises; and(d)    to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:(i)    evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or(ii)    evidential material in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence; or(iii)    evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act);if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence; and(e)    to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be seizable items; and(f)    if the warrant so allows—to conduct an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person at or near the premises if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.…19    The phrase “seizable items” is used in numerous places in the provisions quoted above, but has no application to this case as it is defined in s 3C to be “anything that would present a danger to a person of that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody”.20    Section 3L of the Crimes Act provides for the use of electronic equipment that is at premises being searched, or has been brought onto premises by those executing a search warrant or assisting in its execution.  It also provides restrictive criteria by which such equipment found at premises may be seized.  Importantly, and of particular relevance to this appeal, s 3L(3) provides that such equipment may only be seized if it is not practicable to copy the data on the equipment in accordance with s 3L(1A) or if possession of the equipment could constitute an offence.  Section 3L(1A) is relevant to the decision that was taken to seize computer equipment from certain of the premises, conduct that the primary judge found to be unlawful, a conclusion that is not challenged by the Commissioner.  Section 3L(1A) is also relevant to the formulation of the remedy for this situation arrived at by his Honour.  It provides as follows:If the executing officer or constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that any data accessed by operating the electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, he or she may:(a)    copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device brought to the premises; or(b)    if the occupier of the premises agrees in writing—copy any or all of the data accessed by operating the electronic equipment to a disk, tape or other associated device at the premises;and take the device from the premises.Challenges to search warrantsGeneral principles21    Statutes providing for the issue and execution of search warrants generally reflect a balance struck by legislatures between the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of privacy and property, and the public interest in an effective criminal justice system: George v Rocket (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110.3.  The proper issue and execution of search warrants plays a vitally important role in an effective criminal justice system by facilitating the gathering of evidence that can, in appropriate cases, lead to the apprehension, prosecution, conviction and punishment of those who have broken the criminal law.  22    By authorising an overriding of such private interests in certain circumstances, search warrant legislation gives primacy to the public interest in the administration of criminal justice while also recognising the need for appropriate but limited protection of individual rights through the imposition of statutory conditions for the issue of a valid warrant.  Strict compliance with those conditions is therefore required in order to give effect to that statutory purpose: George v Rocket at 110-111.  However, in construing the statutory requirements for the issue of a search warrant, the Court should be careful to give effect to the legislation by its terms, and not approach its task armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers: Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392; 124 FCR 384 at [68].  Construction of statutes that authorise the search of premises and the seizure of things from them must begin with “the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose”: Hart at [64].  23    Importantly, the search and seizure provisions of the Crimes Act are not punitive and are therefore not to be treated as penal provisions for the purposes of statutory construction:  Hart at [67].  Rather, it is appropriate to see those provisions as subject to the general principle that, in the absence of unmistakeable and unambiguous language, it is to be presumed that the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms and immunities: see, e.g., Hart at [67] and the cases there cited.  For example, in Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427, the High Court considered that, in the absence of a clearly manifested intention to do so, the relevant legislation authorising the issue of a warrant to use a listening device did not also authorise such use where installation of such a device would otherwise constitute a trespass: see, in particular, Coco at 437-8.  24    For modern search warrant legislation, the same strict compliance with the relevant statutory requirements may generally be seen to apply, but no further.  Additional rights or requirements going beyond those spelt out are not easily to be inferred.  As was pointed out in Hart at [65], “effect must be given to importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences”, such that a construction giving effect to “operational realities” is to be preferred to “fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution” of search warrants.  25    In Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 at [312]-[314], the High Court considered the principle affirmed in Coco that a court will not impute to Parliament an intention to abrogate basic rights, freedoms and immunities unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unmistakeable and unambiguous language.  In the context of examination powers in aid of the confiscation of criminally-obtained assets, but applicable also in the search warrant context, the High Court observed:312    More recent statements of the principle in this Court do not detract from the rationale identified in Potter, Bropho and Coco but rather reinforce that rationale (541).  That rationale not only has deep historical roots; it serves important contemporary ends.  It respects the distinct contemporary functions, enhances the distinct contemporary processes, and fulfils the shared contemporary expectations of the legislative and the judicial branches of government.  As put by Gleeson CJ in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (542), in terms often since quoted with approval (543), the principle “is not merely a common sense guide to what a Parliament in a liberal democracy is likely to have intended; it is a working hypothesis, the existence of which is known both to Parliament and the courts, upon which statutory language will be interpreted”.  Gleeson CJ pointed out that the principle is to be applied against the background that “modern legislatures regularly enact laws that take away or modify common law rights” and that the assistance to be gained from the principle “will vary with the context in which it is applied” (544).313    Application of the principle of construction is not confined to the protection of rights, freedoms or immunities that are hard-edged, of long standing or recognised and enforceable or otherwise protected at common law.  The principle extends to the protection of fundamental principles and systemic values.  The principle ought not, however, to be extended beyond its rationale: it exists to protect from inadvertent and collateral alteration rights, freedoms, immunities, principles and values that are important within our system of representative and responsible government under the rule of law; it does not exist to shield those rights, freedoms, immunities, principles and values from being specifically affected in the pursuit of clearly identified legislative objects by means within the constitutional competence of the enacting legislature.  314    The principle of construction is fulfilled in accordance with its rationale where the objects or terms or context of legislation make plain that the legislature has directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of the right, freedom or immunity in question and has made a legislative determination that the right, freedom or immunity is to be abrogated or curtailed.  The principle at most can have limited application to the construction of legislation which has amongst its objects the abrogation or curtailment of the particular right, freedom or immunity in respect of which the principle is sought to be invoked.  The simple reason is that “[i]t is of little assistance, in endeavouring to work out the meaning of parts of [a legislative] scheme, to invoke a general presumption against the very thing which the legislation sets out to achieve” (545).(541)    See Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 329 [20]-[21]; Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562 at 577 [19]-[20]; Australian Education Union v General Manager of Fair Work Australia (2012) 246 CLR 117 at 134-136 [28]-[32].(542)    (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 329 [21].(543)    See, eg, Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2010) 241 CLR 252 at 259 [15]; Australian Education Union v General Manager of Fair Work Australia (2012) 246 CLR 117 at 135 [30].(544)    See Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union (2004) 221 CLR 309 at 328 [19], citing Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 269 at 284 [36].(545)    Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 340 [43].26    In the case of the provisions presently under consideration, the balance between the competing public and private interests may be seen to have shifted to afford even greater primacy to the needs of the criminal justice system, having regard to the legislative enlargement of the relevant investigative powers reflected in Part 1AA of the Crimes Act.  A number of features of that detailed regime, stretching over some 100 pages, warrant particular mention:(1)    the power to seize things is no longer confined to the ambit of the warrant itself, because, pursuant to s 3F(1)(d), a valid search warrant permits, on certain conditions, the seizure of evidential material beyond the scope of the warrant if that material relates to an indictable offence or constitutes evidential material within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) – this provision may be regarded as a statutory version of the principle stated in Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones [1968] 2 QB 299 at 313, concerning the seizure of material going beyond the scope of a search warrant; see also Ghani v Jones [1970] 1 QB 693 at 706;(2)    other invasive acts further to the search for and seizure of material within the express scope of the warrant are also authorised by s 3F, but are required by s 3E(6) to be stated in the search warrant, including:(a)    searching for and recording fingerprints and taking samples for forensic purposes: s 3F(2)(b);(b)    seizing other things found if there is a belief on reasonable grounds that it is a “seizable item”, defined in s 3C(1) as “anything that would present a danger to a person or that could be used to assist a person to escape from lawful custody”: s 3F(1)(e); and(c)    if provided for in the warrant (which must say so either way), a “frisk search” or “ordinary search” (as defined in s 3C(1)), being a search of a person at or near the premises suspected on reasonable grounds to have any evidential material (not apparently confined to evidential material of the kind described in the warrant) or “seizable items”;(3)    if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that data on electronic equipment constitutes evidential material, the executing officer may copy all of the data for later examination or, if that is impracticable, seize the electronic equipment: s 3L.  27    The authorisation conferred by s 3F(1)(d) in particular meets and exceeds the common law power to seize and retain material found that is beyond the scope of a search warrant or any other lawful basis for being on premises and obtaining such material: see again Chic Fashions at 313 and the discussion in Ghani v Jones at 708-9.  Before the enactment of s 3F(1)(d), it may have been in doubt that the search warrant provision in the former s 10 of the Crimes Act bestowed any common law power to seize material lawfully beyond the express terms of a search warrant.  28    The presence and comfort of s 3F(1)(d) should give an incentive to police to obtain search warrants that are tightly focussed on the investigation at hand and relying upon suspicions firmly grounded on what is already known or inferred, including as to the nature of the “evidential material” suspected of being present (or to be present in the next 72 hours) that will be likely to advance the investigation.  This will provide discipline and real assistance to those responsible for the execution of a search warrant and clear guidance for occupiers to enable them to ensure that any seizure is appropriately confined either to the search warrant itself, or to the terms of s 3F(1)(d) and (e).  29    Section 3F(1)(d) and (e) provide ample scope for seizing sufficiently probative but unexpected evidence for indictable offences beyond those described in the search warrant.  In such cases, the decision to seize the material may be made by reference to the character of the material found, including any apparent evidential value for the suspected offence(s) or another indictable offence, without the risks attendant upon relying on a wide and imprecise search warrant.  The mere possibility of finding unexpected evidence should not distract police and other investigators from the proper focus on the express purpose of a search warrant, anchored in the suspicions that gave rise to its issue in the first place.30    These additional provisions and, indeed, the other extensions of power in Part 1AA, do not lower the need for strict compliance with the statutory regime, but they do inform the evaluative exercise as to what constitutes strict compliance.  Indeed, while the balance must be seen to have tipped further in favour of law enforcement over privacy and property interests, careful attention to the conditions governing the issue and execution of a search warrant remains necessary to give effect to the statutory balance as struck.  It is only a valid warrant that gives rise to the existence of the extended powers in ss 3F and 3L in a given case.Principles concerning the validity of issue of a search warrant31    The issue of search warrants may be subject to challenge in a number of different ways according to the process adopted and the statutory regime in question.  The two ways that have been the subject of detailed judicial consideration are where the information relied upon for issue of the warrant is said in some way to be incomplete, and where the information is in some way said to be inadequate.  Only the latter – asserted inadequate information – is in issue in this case.  It is, however, worth mentioning the former briefly, because the principles involved serve to demonstrate further the nature of the administrative process and the limitations on judicial review.  32    For a relatively short time, a Full Court decision in Karina Fisheries Pty Ltd v Mitson (1990) 26 FCR 473 at 481 equated, by obiter dicta, a search warrant application with an ex parte curial application, giving rise to a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides) to disclose all material facts to the decision-maker, being a duty of the kind stated in Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 682.  That heresy by way of false equivalence between executive and judicial processes was firmly displaced by a subsequent Full Court decision in Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio (1994) 52 FCR 542 at 555-6, 566D-E.  The only judge who sat on both appeals, Hill J, observed that the existence of an obligation to make full disclosure was not the subject of any argument in the appeal in Karina Fisheries, nor was it essential for the decision: see Lego at 564F.  33    As decided in Lego, where there has been an omission of relevant material by a person seeking the issue of a search warrant, the test is whether the material that was before the decision-maker was sufficient to meet the statutory conditions for the grant of the search warrant.  George v Rockett involved such a finding as to the insufficiency of material before the issuing officer, turning on the particular and unusual circumstances in that case.  As with other administrative decisions, however, the issue of a search warrant may also be rendered invalid where fraud or misrepresentation has induced the grant of the warrant, such that the warrant would not have issued but for the misstatement: Lego at 555-6, 569A.  It was considered by Hill J, in a separate judgment, that an actionable deficiency may also be established by want of good faith, but inadvertent omission will not suffice unless sufficiently material: Lego at 570F.  None of those factors were present in this case.34    In all challenges to the validity of the issue of a search warrant, the usual restraints on judicial review intervention will apply.  This includes, most importantly, the principle that the decision manifested in the search warrant issued must be read beneficially, and not with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Minister for Immigration And Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-2.  However, application of that principle must accommodate the purposes of a search warrant in informing both those executing it and occupiers as to the scope of the search that is authorised.  The scope of a search warrant may be far from precise given that it is issued for an investigative purpose, based upon the low threshold of “suspicion” being met.  All that really means is that an error or misdescription must be shown to be material to the purposes of a search warrant.  However when it comes to mismatches between the information and the search warrant, that feature must not be approached with undue technicality or any requirement for excessive precision.  Practical considerations must always be kept steadily in mind:  Baker v Campbell (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 83.  Principles concerning invalidity on the face of a search warrant35    Some of the leading and authoritative statements on sufficiency on the face of a search warrant, focussing, as is so often the case, on the description of the suspected offence, are to be found in Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523, a decision of the Full Court, with the main judgment being that of Burchett J.  Sheppard J agreed with Burchett J, while Pincus J only relevantly disagreed to the extent that his Honour would have preferred an even less stringent test for a sufficient offence description than that outlined below.  36    While Beneficial Finance dealt with the much simpler search warrant provision in the former s 10 of the Crimes Act, it nonetheless contains a number of principles that are of continuing application.  Before turning to those passages, it should be observed by way of context that Burchett J considered a range of authority, some of which suggested that a search warrant needed to meet a test purportedly derived from Canadian cases in which it had been held that the “exact object of the search” had to be disclosed.  Such a stringent test was rejected, including by reference to Canadian cases that suggested no such stringency.  This analysis required the statement to that effect by Jackson J in Parker v Churchill (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 348 to be either read down or discarded.  Burchett J also rejected technical arguments based on a strict application of the formal operation of taxation law provisions in a search warrant context, an approach with some resonance to this case, as the primary judge was evidently well aware.37    A number of the key principles to emerge from Beneficial Finance are as follows (with some modernisation of language to fit with that in the current provisions):(1)    Burchett J said at 533.6 (although the change to a dual suspicion test in s 3E should be noted):The authorities make it clear that the statement of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment.  That would be impossible, and indeed to attempt it would be irrational, bearing in mind the stage of the investigation at which a search warrant may issue.  The purpose of the statement of the offence in the warrant is not to define the issues for trial; but to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant will involve, as part of an investigation into a suspected crime.  The appropriate contrast is not with the sort of error which might vitiate an indictment, but with the failure to focus the statutory suspicion and belief upon any particular crime, with the result that a condition of the issue of the warrant is not fulfilled, and it purports to be a general warrant of the kind the law decisively rejected in the 18th century.  …The above passage was quoted with approval by the High Court in State of New South Wales v Corbett [2007] HCA 32; 230 CLR 606 at [99], applying the same reasoning to the State search warrant provision that was under consideration in that case.(2)    Of necessity, the line as to what may and may not be seized cannot be precisely drawn, since a search warrant is not concerned with what is known, but with what there is reasonable grounds for suspecting: Beneficial Finance at 534.3, quoting from his Honour’s prior judgment at first instance in Parker v Churchill, (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 319;(3)    the requirement of particularity in an offence description is directed to ensuring that the occupier knows the object of the search and can therefore make “some assessment of the material likely to prove relevant”, because it is unacceptable otherwise to leave an occupier “in the dark”: Beneficial Finance at 539.3, quoting Toohey J, when a member of this Court in Quartermaine v Netto (unreported, 14 December 1984) – the offence description upheld in Quartermaine was considerably more vague than the offence descriptions in this case, insofar as no date for the suspected offences was identified at all;(4)    given the stage at which a search warrant is granted, it may not be known what particular offences may have been committed, such that it is sufficient that the warrant specifies the suspected offences in such a way as to enable the executing officer and those assisting to decide if the things seized come within the terms of the warrant: Beneficial Finance at 539.5, reproducing the quotation relied on by Toohey J in Quartermaine from Coward v Allen (1984) 52 ALR 320 at 332;(5)    the question of the sufficiency of an offence description should be viewed broadly, having regard to the terms of the warrant in the circumstances of each case, and not answered by the bare application of a verbal formula but, rather, in accordance with the principle that a search warrant should disclose the nature of the offence so as to indicate the area of search, with the precision required varying from case to case: Beneficial Finance at 543.7. 38    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J rejected a submission that the search warrants in that case were bad for generality, stating at 544 that:They limit the area of search by reference (inter alia) to offences sufficiently described to enable an ordinary reader to understand what are the subjects of the reasonable grounds for suspicion and belief that are recited.  The language may not be elegant.  It may do some violence to a fine appreciation of how the law expressed in s 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be classified.39    A number of key passages from Beneficial Finance were quoted with approval by the High Court in Corbett, giving the Full Court’s views additional weight.  In particular, approval was given in Corbett at [103] to the conclusion that the question of the sufficiency of the offence description should not be answered by the application of verbal formula.  At [106] in Corbett it was stated that it is the nature of the offence that is critical, which had to be “stated sufficiently to enable the issuing justice to understand the object of the search and to appreciate the boundaries of the authorisation to enter, search and seize”.40    What emerges from Beneficial Finance and the many cases since that have followed, applied or approved it, including Corbett in particular, is a test of sufficiency to indicate the area of search, not precision or particular accuracy.  There is no legal principle creating an abstract test by which the nature and degree of precision in the statement of a suspected offence in a search warrant will be inadequate, such as the term used in submissions of law made on behalf of Mr Caratti of “intolerable ambiguity”.  Whether an offence description is adequate or sufficient – or not – is a matter for assessment in all the circumstances of the case at hand.  It is largely a factual and practical evaluation, which may be affected to a significant degree by context and nuance.  It is substantially a trial determination, rather than an appeal determination, as the subjective nature of the determination will seldom lend itself to being a conclusion that was not open to a primary judge, even if members of an appeal court might have reached a different conclusion.  The above principles make appellate intervention, which is already difficult in many cases, often very hard to achieve in search warrant cases.  That is all the more so when there has been oral evidence, cross-examination, credit assessments and the drawing of inferences.  Those difficulties are compounded by the discretionary nature of the relief that may be granted or refused.41    In the Full Court decision in Dunesky v Elder (1994) 54 FCR 540, four out of five judges upheld the validity of the search warrants under challenge.  The plurality (Lockhart, Beaumont and Hill JJ), with whom Lindgren J agreed (also making further observations on topics not applicable to this case), said at 555E that in was “not impermissible to describe the object of the search in a broad, or non-specific fashion”, and at 557C that the “real object of the third condition is the identification of the kind of offences alleged”.  However, those broad and otherwise useful principles are undermined in this case by the lack of discipline in the drafting of the first two conditions in the present search warrants, placing a heavier burden on the third condition.  Nonetheless, the role of the third condition remains an identification of the kind of offence being investigated.  There is nothing inherently wrong with a search warrant that confines the search to only part of a suspected offence period, or conduct that only relates to a part of the suspected offending.  42    Applying the above principles to cases of the present kind, it may be observed that, conceptually, the investigation and prosecution of an alleged fraud of some kind (using that term in a generic way that includes offences of the kind suspected in this case) commonly requires evidence and proof of what the impugned party represented to be the position, what the true position was, and what difference it made, including questions of deceit or dishonesty in departing from the true position.  In the case of such suspected offences, there will often be material held by the party said to have been defrauded in some way, such as representations made, and what took place as a result of such representations, such as money being paid, or not being required to be paid.  What will be lacking is evidence of what the true position is.  There is nothing wrong with a search warrant that focusses on obtaining evidence as to what is merely suspected to exist for the purposes of contrasting it with what was already known and what had already happened in terms of suspected fraudulent loss.  That may cause the search warrant to be focussed on a particular aspect of the conduct under investigation, including a particular point in time.Principles concerning the invalid execution of a search warrant43    In Dunesky v Commonwealth (1996) 33 ATR 491, Lockhart J was considering a challenge to the execution of the search warrants under challenge, following the upholding of their validity by another primary judge and the Full Court (by a 4-1 majority) and the subsequent refusal of special leave to appeal by the High Court: see Dunesky v Elder in the Full Court for the final resting place of that unsuccessful challenge, as referred to above.  Lockhart J noted at 500:A search warrant is a severe intrusion into a person's privacy, home or place of business.  The law takes care to ensure that the powers of police officers entrusted with the task of executing a search warrant are not exceeded; but at the same time it must be borne in mind that execution of a search warrant is a practical exercise carried out by police officers who, though trained in their task of law enforcement, are generally not qualified lawyers.  Just as a person’s privacy must be respected so must the investigation of criminal offences not be unreasonably impeded.44    After citing a range of authority, including from the High Court, on the need to focus on the practical aspects of search warrant execution, Lockhart J observed at 501:The obligation of police officers executing warrants is to act reasonably in all the circumstances of the case: Crowley v Murphy at FLR 152-5; Bartlett v Weir at A Crim R 518.  The warrant must be executed according to its terms and in accordance with the requirements of s 10 [now s 3E]: Dunesky at FCR 556.  Consideration can be given to what is contained in the information in order to decide whether or not documents fall within the scope of the warrants.  In the present case there was a briefing of the relevant police officers prior to the search; the information together with its attachments was available to the police officers; and the police officers had advice from ATO officers who had been involved in the preceding lengthy audit and who understood the issues.His Honour further observed at 501-2:It is to be remembered in this case, where the classes of documents which may be seized pursuant to the terms of the warrant are wide indeed, that documents will not fail to satisfy the three conditions contained in the warrant merely because (a) they bear dates outside the period of the commission of the alleged offences specified in the warrant; (b) they relate also to persons other than persons revealed by the warrant as being suspected of committing the offences; or (c) they relate to some subject distinct from the matter under investigation.  Documents may meet all three conditions notwithstanding those matters. 45    In order for Mr Caratti to succeed on the aspect of his appeal concerning the execution of the search warrants, he needed to demonstrate that the primary judge strayed impermissibly from the broad evaluative exercise that his Honour was entitled to carry out.Principles concerning severance46    The relevant principles were helpfully and comprehensively summarised by the primary judge as follows, there being no suggestion of any error in his Honour’s survey of the law:Severance 227    In Parker v Churchill, Jackson J found that significant parts of a search warrant that purported to describe the offences to which the warrant related were invalid.  His Honour declared those parts of the warrant to be invalid, but ordered that the invalid parts could be severed from the warrants.   His Honour declared the warrants to be otherwise valid.  His Honour said (at 350): There is no reason why a search warrant granted under s 10 may not include in respect of the same place a number of quite different matters and there is nothing in the section itself to suggest that if one of the matters so included exceeds the powers conferred by s 10, the warrant necessarily fails as to the other matters.  It is possible, of course, that the good and bad parts of the warrants may be so interlinked that one cannot stand without the other but that would usually mean no more than that the parts, as a matter of construction of the warrant, were not truly separate.  Further, as the primary judge said, the authorities suggest that a search warrant, being an order of a justice is divisible and when good in part and bad in part, the good may be divided from the bad, and the good affirmed and the bad quashed: see R v Johnson & Franklin Wholesale Distributors Ltd (1971) 3 CCC (2d) 484; Adler v Attorney-General of Alberta (supra) at 139-140; Abou-Assale v Bourden JSP (1978) I CR (3d) 213 at 231; Coward v Allen (1984) 52 ALR 320 and Brewer v Castles (No 3) (1984) 52 ALR 581.228    Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J, other than in respect of one part of the warrant that Jackson J had declared invalid.  It is readily apparent that Bowen CJ and Lockhart J agreed with Jackson J in relation to the question of severance.  They declared that certain parts of the warrant were invalid, but that the warrants were otherwise valid.229    In Beneficial Finance, Burchett J (with whom Sheppard J agreed at 525) considered that it was open to sever parts of a warrant which incorrectly recited the language of the former s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  His Honour said (at 545).The severability of a search warrant has some importance for the present case because of the argument, further consideration of which I deferred earlier in these reasons, that the warrants contain an inaccurate reproduction of the language of s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and thus purport to authorise inappropriately the seizure of things ""in respect to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that [the suspected offences] have been committed"".  In my opinion, if this portion of the warrants is invalid, it is readily severable.  As there has been no suggestion that any particular document has been, or is likely to have been, seized in reliance upon this portion of either of the warrants, it is unnecessary to decide whether the failure to follow precisely the wording of the statute did have any vitiating effect. I am unable to imagine anything in this case which could be a thing ""in respect to which"" the offence had been committed, yet would not fall within the terms of that part of the warrant which accurately reflects s 10(1)(b).  That has already been made clear in the discussion of the true meaning of the word ""and"" in this very special context.  The reflection of s 10(1)(a) in the drafting of the document cannot, in the circumstances, have made any practical difference to the search or the seizure. It would be an apotheosis of pedantry to refuse to sever the warrant, and to invalidate it on this ground.230    Pincus J agreed “substantially” with the reasons of Burchett J, including that severance of invalid portions of a warrant is appropriate in some circumstances.  His Honour took issue, however, with Burchett J’s view that it was relevant, in the context of severance, that there had been no suggestion that documents had been seized in reliance on the invalid parts.  Pincus J expressed the view (at 526) that it “cannot be incumbent upon the party challenging an executed warrant to show which documents were seized in reliance on particular parts of it”.231    In Peters v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1988) 16 NSWLR 24, McHugh JA followed Parker v Churchill and held that the doctrine of severability applied to warrants that were issued in excess of power.  His Honour noted (at 41D-E), however, that “it is not possible to sever a warrant where the invalid provision forms part of an inseparable context, or would operate differently or produce a different result from that which was intended”.  Perhaps even more importantly, his Honour found that, because warrants are instruments for the purposes of provisions such as s 32 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), they are to be read and construed to the extent that they can be read as valid instruments.  The result was to throw the burden upon the person attacking an entire warrant to prove, in effect, that if the invalid part of the warrant was severed, the warrant would have operated differently, or would have produced a different result to that intended.47    It follows that the key issue in determining whether severance can take place is whether the invalid part of the search warrant can be separated from the valid parts remaining.  That is a largely a question of fact.  For Mr Caratti to succeed on this ground of appeal, he must show that the severance conclusion reached by the primary judge was not open to his Honour. 48    The Commissioner’s written submissions also rely upon the terms of s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which provide, in relation to instruments other than legislative instruments, notifiable instruments or rules of court:If any instrument so made would, but for this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the authority’s power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.49    While s 46(2) tends to reinforce the principles in the cases considered by the primary judge above, it does not gainsay the need for the evaluative exercise as to whether severance is possible.The terms of the search warrants and affidavits in support50    The relevant search warrants were obtained by way of an affidavit of Federal Agent Gary Szolnoki, which was provided on or about 23 January 2015 to a magistrate of the Perth Magistrates Court, acting administratively rather than judicially.  The search warrants sought concerned premises associated with Mr Caratti and Ms Tina Bazzo, his de-facto partner.  The supporting affidavit deposed to a suspicion that Mr Caratti (together, in one instance, with Ms Bazzo) may have committed five tax-related offences through various corporate entities of either obtaining a financial advantage by deception from a Commonwealth entity, or dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity, in contravention of ss 134.2(1) or 135.1(3) respectively of the Criminal Code (Cth) (which is in the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)).  Both offences rely upon a Commonwealth entity having been adversely affected by the conduct.  The Commonwealth entity was erroneously described in the offence descriptions as the Australian Taxation Office: see Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686; 190 A Crim R 265 at [125]-[128].  However, the primary judge was correct to conclude that nothing of substance turned on this error.  51    Mr Szolnoki’s affidavit advanced the following general narrative before turning to the material relied upon in respect of each of the five offences under investigation (noting that certain parts of the affidavit were redacted by reason of public interest immunity claims, accompanied by a concession by the Commissioner that the content of those passages could not change the result):6.1    In 2008, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) commenced Project CABALLUS to identify risks associated with the principal individuals of the “CARATTI Group”: Allen Bruce CARATTI, born 24 February 1956 (A.CARATTI), his de-facto partner Tina BAZZO, born 24 February 1966 (BAZZO) and his brother John CARATTI (J.CARATTI).  The CARATTI Group are prominent members of the Western Australian business community, primarily concerned with land development and investment.  The ATO estimates that the CARATTTI Group holds equity in commercial and residential property to the value of $726,000,000.  Land holdings by associate companies are estimated to be the largest in the State.6.2    The CARATTI family has a history of non-compliance with the ATO dating back to the 1970’s.  The ATO describe the CARATTI Group as being one of the most difficult syndicates they have investigated due to their wealth, use of numerous privately owned businesses, and intimate knowledge of ATO processes and tax law.  Despite continued scrutiny and repeated ATO audits, A.CARATTI and BAZZO continue to operate in a highly non-compliant manner with respect to their taxation obligations.6.3    In 1991, the ATO referred information to the AFP where it was alleged that A.CARATTI, J.CARATTI and their mother, Madeleine CARATTI (M.CARATTI) were engaged in large scale taxation fraud.  Following a joint AFP/ATO investigation, A.CARATTI, J.CARATTI and M.CARATTI were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of $5.8 million.  In June 1999, J.CARATTI was found guilty and sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment.  A.CARATTI and M.CARATTI were found not guilty.6.4    The ATO have advised that between 2000 and 2014, A.CARATTI has been linked with approximately 222 entities (businesses), whether as a Director, some form of office bearer or other connection, and that entities associated with him and BAZZO continue to accumulate considerable wealth even though many report financial losses each financial year.6.5    Since commencing Project CABALLUS, the ATO has issued assessments for outstanding tax liabilities totalling approximately $93,000,000.00 in relation to the non-declaration of income and Goods and Services Tax (GST) by entities controlled by A.CARATTI and BAZZO.6.6    Between May and December 2013, the ATO referred 11 matters to the AFP for investigation alleging that A.CARATTI and BAZZO were committing fraud against the ATO.6.7     Operation CABALLUS is a joint AFP/ATO investigation focusing on four of 11 incidents referred to the AFP by the ATO alleging tax evasion and forgery by A.CARATTI and BAZZO related entities, specifically the alleged avoidance of lawful taxation in relation to land developments by Starbrake Pty Ltd (STARBRAKE), Westend Assets Pty Ltd (WESTEND), Forrest Hope Pty Ltd (FORREST HOPE) and Whitby Land Company (WHITBY).52    The affidavit then turned to the conduct that was said to ground the requisite suspicion in relation to each offence.  That material has been considered further below.53    On 27 January 2015, on the basis of the evidence provided by Federal Agent Sznolnoki, the Magistrate, acting administratively, issued search warrants in respect of the premises at the following identified addresses (the street numbers do not need to be reproduced again here):(1)    Wickham Street, East Perth, being the registered business address of Gucce Holdings and Mammoth Nominees;(2)    Duncraig Road, Applecross, Western Australia, being Mr Caratti’s residential premises and the registered office of Whitby Land Company;(3)    Cornish Turn, Baldivis, Western Australia, being the residential address of Mr Schokker, Mr Caratti’s accountant or tax adviser;(4)    Great Eastern Highway, Redcliffe, Western Australia, being the registered business address of Mammoth Investments; (5)    A unit in Irvin Street, Perth, Western Australia, being the officers of a firm of solicitors that acted for Starbrake in relation to the purchase of the Calloway Street property;(6)    A unit in Main Street, Osborne Park, Western Australia, being the offices of Mr Catanecci, the accountant or tax agent that provided accounting services for Starbrake; and  (7)    Two motor vehicles apparently associated with Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  54    A further search warrant was obtained for premises at Wright Road, Harrisdale Western Australia by an affidavit sworn on 4 March 2015, which annexed a copy of the prior affidavit, and contained additional information.  55    The search warrants issued were in substantially the same terms, except that the warrant for the premises at Wright Road omitted the first two suspected offences from the third condition.  As was the case before the primary judge, differences in the list of persons or companies referred to in the second condition of each warrant do not bear in any material way on the issues raised by Mr Caratti.  It is sufficient to reproduce below, by way of example, the relevant parts of the search warrant executed at Mr Caratti’s residential premises in Applecross, Perth, which was relied on by the primary judge as sufficiently representative for determination of Mr Caratti’s challenges to the warrants generally.56    The first condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:FIRST CONDITIONthings which are:•    Personal or laptop computers and peripheral devices;•    Mobile telephones, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Cards, computer hard drives and equipment, faxes or any other electronic storage medium;•    Identification documents; and•    Emails, email addresses, user names and passwords.originals or copies of any one or more of the following, including any of them which are stored on a computer, or on a computer storage device, or on any other type of storage medium or storage device:•    Business records including general correspondence, invoice books, receipts, purchase orders, confirmation of orders, balance sheets, journals, ledgers, cash books, cash payment books, books of accounts, contracts, agreements, diaries, notes including handwritten notes, facsimile communications, address  books, working papers, price lists, quotations, orders, invoices, commercial invoices, tax invoices, business cards, payment records, purchase records, sales records, sales orders, catalogues, delivery dockets, accounts payable, accounts receivable, minutes, telephone records, desk calendars and blotters, single transaction permissions, continuing permissions, computer files or records, electronic mail records and other records;•    Banking and other financial institution records including bank statements, bank books, deposit books, bank vouchers, deposit and withdrawal slips, cheque books, cheque butts, or other correspondence with financial institutions;•    Taxation records, including documents concerning the preparation and completion of business activity statements and taxation returns;•    Notebooks, diaries, telephone numbers, handwritten notes;•    Conveyancing files, including but not limited to contracts of sale, copies of payments, file notes, correspondence with vendor and purchaser, invoices and receipts detailing payments into solicitors trust accounts;•    Trust documents and deeds;•    Trust files; and•    Land title documents.57    It may be observed that the above list of items said to be the subject of the requisite suspicion and to be the material sought to be seized is extremely wide and does not, of itself, meaningfully limit the scope of the search warrant.58    The second condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:SECOND CONDITIONand which relate to any one or more of the following:•    Allen Bruce CARATTI;•    Tina Michelle BAZZO;•    Christina Marcia CARATTI;•    Liang Ll;•    Josephine Lynette BAZZO;•    Rocla Pty Ltd;•    Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd ACN 101 717 177;•    Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd ACN 008 735 797;•    Joseph Catenacci Pty Ltd ACN 009 025 405;•    Joseph CATENACCI;•    Nicholas CHANDLER;•    Stuart MACKINNON;•    Andy LIU;•    Nancy MUSGRAVE;•    Ewing Consulting Engineers Pty Ltd;•    Isaac Meyer ELLISON;•    Henricus (Hank) SCHOKKER;•    Bendigo Bank account number: [NUMBER REDACTED];•    Bendigo Bank account number: [NUMBER REDACTED] ;•    National Australia Bank;•    Suncorp Metway Bank;•    Bank of Western Australia (Bank West);•    Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd ACN 099 191 714;•    Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd ACN 115 233 193;•    Westend Asset Pty Ltd ACN 106 132 790;•    Forrest Hope Pty Ltd ACN 122 459 554;•    Starbrake Pty Ltd ACN 107 942 058;•    Ashford Taxation;•    Clayton Utz Commercial Law Firm;•    Herbert Smith Freehills;•    Wilson and Atkinson Law Firm;•    I.M.E Nominees Pty Ltd;•    allen@mammothgroup.com.au;•    Gucce Group;•    Admin4@mammothgroup.com.au;•    catenacci@bigpond.com.au;•    lsaac@guccegroup.com.au;•    Nicholas CHANDLER;•    Dfts99@gmail.com;•    [TELEPHONE NUMBER REDACTED]•    [TELEPHONE NUMBER REDACTED];•    Lot 3, Diagram 15871, Certificate of Title Volume 1267, Folio 569;•    Lot 9029 Broadway, Aveley Western Australia 6069;•    SLS Accounting;•    293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale Western Australia 6112; and•    52 Callaway Street, Wangara, Western Australia 6065.59    Again, it may be observed that the above list not only contains a long list of names, but also a number of other entities and addresses, including law firms.  As with the list in the first condition, this does not, of itself, in a practical sense substantially limit the scope of the search warrant, although it does confine to some degree the ambit of the matters to which the investigation relates.60    The third condition of the representative search warrant was as follows:THIRD CONDITIONand as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will afford evidence as to the commission of the following indictable offence(s) against the laws of the Commonwealth:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he reclassified royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd into a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI did fail to pass on Goods and Services Tax collected by Starbrake Pty Ltd to the Australian Taxation Office, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person, namely Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he falsified costs incurred by Westend Asset Ply Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he caused the Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd to withhold Goods and Services Tax, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In December 2011 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO, by a deception, in that they falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by overstating Goods and Services Tax input credits, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Together with any storage medium or storage device which contains any of the above things and any manual, instruction, password or other thing which is needed to gain access to or interpret or decode any of the above things.61    The list of offences in the third condition above is reasonably confined, although subject to challenge as to the manner in which each was expressed, as detailed below.  The third condition was therefore the main means by which the ambit of the search was confined, avoiding at least the vice of being a general warrant necessarily beyond the scope of s 3E of the Crimes Act.  General warrants have been considered to be unlawful in the absence of clear statutory authority since at least the eighteenth century: see Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 State Tr 1029, cited in Ghani v Jones at first instance, [1970] 1 QB 693 at 696.62    It should be observed that all of the search warrants adopted the above three-condition format.  That format was approved by the Full Court in Dunesky v Elder at 557C, and ordinarily operates to confine the ambit of the warrant by reference to the types of things sought, the persons or other entities to which such things relate, and the offences which such things meeting both prior conditions as suspected would afford evidence.  The three-condition format may be thought of visually as a Venn diagram comprising three overlapping circles, each representing the limitations imposed by one of the conditions.  The search warrant only authorises the seizure of those items in the single portion common to all three circles.  As noted above, however, the effective authority conferred by a s 3E search warrant is considerably wider than its search terms, having regard to the incidental seizures that are permitted by s 3F(1)(d) and (e).  This means that there is little basis for concern that a suitably tight and confined warrant will lead to having to leave material behind that is probative either of the offence under investigation or other indictable offences.63    The three-condition format is used to address the difficulty identified by the High Court in George v Rockett that the easier it might be to establish reasonable grounds for a suspicion that a particular thing is at given premises, the harder it would be to establish reasonable grounds for a belief that such a thing, if found, would afford evidence of the commission of an offence, and vice versa.  It should be noted that the provision under consideration in George v Rockett was expressed in terms of suspicion as to specified types of things being present, and belief as to such things affording evidence of an offence, in contrast to the dual suspicion test in s 3E of the Crimes Act, considered further below.  The decision in George v Rockett at 115 is often cited and quoted as to the meaning of suspicion and belief, derived from the prior Privy Council decision concerning false imprisonment in Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at 948 and from the High Court bankruptcy case of Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303.  Belief is a clearly higher and more demanding state of mind.  64    The High Court in George v Rockett addressed the stress between the state of mind as to suspicion that an item will be present at premises, and the state of mind as to belief that such an item, if found, will afford evidence of the commission of an offence as follows at 117:… It is by reference to the means of identification of the object of the search that the sufficiency of both reasonable grounds for suspecting and reasonable grounds for believing must be judged.  Where a specific object is identified, the question whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that, if it exists and is found, it will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence is a discrete question to be answered according to the facts set out in the complaint.  Where the object is identified by description, the broader and less specific the description, the more difficult it is likely to be to satisfy the requirement of reasonable grounds for believing that a thing answering the description will afford evidence of the commission of an offence.  Conversely, the narrower and more specific the description, the more difficult it may be to satisfy the requirement of reasonable grounds for suspecting that the designated object is in the particular location. …65    Relevantly, and in contrast to the situation that existed in the legislation under consideration in George v Rockett, s 3E of the Crimes Act does not require “belief”, but rather “suspicion” of the matters stipulated under both of the two limbs of the test.  This is a less advanced or substantial state of mind than belief, and may be established by the existence of “conjecture or surmise”: George v Rockett at 115-6.  The test is dual in nature because s 3E requires that the necessary “suspicion”, and the existence of reasonable grounds to induce that state of mind, be demonstrated in respect of both the likelihood that particular items will be present at the subject premises, and the likelihood that those items, if found, will afford evidence, in the sense of being potentially probative in some way, of a named offence.  66    The three-condition structure approved in Dunesky v Elder and used in the present case works best when a measure of discipline is applied to the ambit of all three parameters, rather than simply including every conceivable type of thing that might be found, and every conceivable entity that might be connected to the matters under investigation in any way, no matter how obscure or improbable.  If the investigation until the point at which a search warrant is obtained permits some precision, it is highly desirable for that to be reflected in the drafting of the search warrant.  It involves writing less, rather than more, albeit with perhaps greater care in the choice of what is listed and what is not.  If the checklist which each condition facilitates is to be of much practical use at the time of execution, the list must be of a workable and sensible length and detail for all three conditions to operate together in an optimal way to address the stress identified in George v Rockett.  In combination, the three conditions should operate to make the assessment of what should and should not be seized easier and quicker.67    In the present case, however, a disciplined approach was not observed in framing the first two conditions of the search warrants, as their terms reproduced above make clear.  Instead, a wide “shopping list” approach was taken, with the evident purpose being to make each as wide and general as possible.  That approach is contrary to the purpose of having the first two conditions to enable the things realistically suspected of being present and relevant listed, but not confined to things that will necessarily afford evidence of the commission of the suspected offences.  Accordingly, those first two conditions were cast in very wide terms, reflecting no real attempt to confine the ambit of the search or contribute in any useful way to informing the relevant occupiers or those executing the search warrants as to the parameters of the search.  All the narrowing or culling work was left to the third condition.  The effect of this, as demonstrated by the nature of the ultimate challenges to the warrants that ensued, was that the burden of adequately defining the ambit of the search authorised by the warrants fell substantially on the description of the suspected offences.  68    If that was a deliberate or strategic choice, it was a very high risk approach to take.  It made the validity of the search warrants more vulnerable to challenge, and their execution more difficult to defend.  In this case, it led to seizures that might have resulted in evidence being ordered to be returned.  Persisting with such an approach could easily lead to that result in a future case and, indeed, risks invalidity and the consequent grounding of causes of action for torts such as trespass and detinue.  If any of the extended frisk powers are used, that could extend to grounding the tort of battery (and perhaps even assault), as the legal substratum authorising such a search would be absent.  69    In this case, the drafting approach also opened up many different avenues of challenge and required reliance on what had taken place prior to the execution of the warrant and in the course of that investigation, rather than the warrant itself being able to do most of the work.  That, in turn, required more witnesses to be called and a protracted hearing to take place, testing to an extent the detail of what had taken place.  Not much of that detail was revisited in the appeal, in part because initial allegations of an improper or unlawful purpose in obtaining the search warrants were not pursued before the primary judge, apparently once the evidence filed for the Commissioner made that approach untenable.  The case ultimately pursued before the primary judge and on appeal relied more heavily on the defects in drafting, although the execution of the search warrants remained an active ground of review on appeal.70    Given the focus in this appeal on the written word, it is convenient to outline the material advanced in the supporting affidavit by separate reference to each of the five offences, save for the first and second offences, which are dealt with together, and the primary judge’s views on what was deposed to.  First and second suspected offences (the Starbrake allegations)Text in the search warrant71    The first and second suspected offences were stated in the third condition of the warrant as follows:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he reclassified royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd into a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI did fail to pass on Goods and Services Tax collected by Starbrake Pty Ltd to the Australian Taxation Office, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person, namely Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material for the first and second suspected offences (Starbrake allegations)72    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the first and second offences were as follows:6.8    Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) records indicate that STARBRAKE was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 11 February 2004.  A.CARATTI was recorded as an office bearer of STARBRAKE and held the following positions within the company …6.9    STARBRAKE has an issued share capital of $2.00 comprising two ordinary shares which are beneficially owned by A.CARATTI.…6.11    Western Australian Government Lands Title Office (Landgate) records indicate that in December 2004, STARBRAKE purchased land identified as Lot 3 on Diagram 15871, certificate of title Volume 1267 and folio 569, located at 52 CALLAWAY Street, Wangara, WA, 6065 (CALLAWAY STREET), through a loan acquired via the Suncorp Bank.…6.20    On 8 June 2006, Ray White Valuers provided an initial valuation of the unimproved property located at CALLAWAY STREET.  The valuation states that STARBRAKE is the registered owner of the land, within the valuation it states that Rocla Pty Ltd (ROCLA) have agreed to extract sand at a royalty of $2 per cubic metre with all extraction costs to be paid by ROCLA.  The land valuation was sent to Suncorp Bank, titled Mortgage Finance Valuation by Ray White.6.21    In 2008, STARBRAKE acquired the services of Clayton Utz Commercial Law Firm to prepare a lease agreement with ROCLA.  On 1 July 2008, STARBRAKE granted ROCLA a lease over the land at CALLAWAY STREET and an exclusive licence to carry out extraction of sand on the land.  This lease was signed by A.CARATTI in his capacity as Director of STARBRAKE.  On 1 July 2008 (2009 income year), ROCLA paid a royalty of $7,700,000.00 (inclusive of $700,000.00 of GST) to STARBRAKE for the grant of the licence.  This money was paid into a Bendigo Bank Account in the name of STARBRAKE, account number 633000-0016132912.6.22    On 3 July 2008, $7,200,000.00 was transferred from the above named STARBRAKE account to a second Bendigo Bank account, in the name of MAMMOTH, account number 633000-117556654.  The transfer was described as “Loan / Starbrake P/L”.6.23    At the time of the signing of the lease, STARBRAKE acquired the services of Herbert Smith Freehills lawyers to draft a side deed, between ROCLA, STARBRAKE and Bank of Western Australia (BANK WEST).  Clause 5.1(a)(10) of the deed states that STARBRAKE has received payment of the royalty as prepayment for the contract quality of sand.6.24    On 17 October 2008, STARBRAKE lodged its Business Activity Statement (BAS) for the period of 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008.  The BAS did not include the $700,000.00 of GST, payable to the ATO, relative to the royalty they had received from ROCLA.  At this time of this lodgment, A.CARATTI was the Director of STARBRAKE.6.25    In February 2012, STARBRAKE lodged its income tax return for the 2009 income year.  The income tax return did not include the royalty of $7,000,000.00 (excluding the $700,000.00 GST) it had received from ROCLA as part of its assessable income.  At this time of this lodgment, A.CARATTI was the Director of STARBRAKE. 6.26    An ATO audit of the financial records of STARBRAKE, being the general ledger, disclosed that the $7,700,000.00 royalty received from ROCLA was recorded as a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd (MAMMOTH), an entity related to STARBRAKE by virtue of common directors and shareholdings.  However, financial records of MAMMOTH, obtained by the ATO, did not disclose a loan made to STARBRAKE.6.27    ASIC records indicate that MAMMOTH was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 15 August 2002.  A.CARATTI is recorded as the Director and Secretary of the company.  The registered office is located at 2 Duncraig Road Applecross, WA, 6153, the home address of A.CARATTI.…6.29    The applicant suspects that A.CARATTI directed the reclassification of the royalty received from ROCLA to a loan from MAMMOTH so as to obtain a financial advantage by understating STARBRAKE’s taxable income for the 2009 income tax year.  This resulted in STARBRAKE not paying an estimated $1,800,000 in income tax on the $7,000,000 royalty from ROCLA nor the associated $700,000 GST.73    Thus the allegations under investigation were that in the September quarter of the 2008-2009 financial year, Mr Caratti, in his capacity as the sole director of Starbrake Pty Ltd, directed that $7.7 million received from Rocla Pty Ltd be reclassified as a loan to obtain a financial benefit dishonestly.  The benefit was alleged to have been realised in two ways.  First, the $700,000 payable in Goods and Services Tax (GST) was not declared and remitted as part of Starbrakes’s September 2008 business activity statement.  Secondly, the income of $7 million (net of GST) was not declared in Starbrake’s 2008-2009 tax return.  The two suspected offences focused on the aspect of the 2008 reclassification of the $7.7 million payment, at Mr Caratti’s direction, that gave rise to these two alleged fraudulent tax benefits, rather than upon when documents were lodged with the ATO.  As the primary judge explained:The Starbrake allegations 21    The first group of allegations concerned a company called Starbrake Pty Ltd.  At the relevant time Mr Caratti was a director of Starbrake and beneficially owned all of its shares.  In late 2004 Starbrake purchased land at 52 Callaway Street, Wangara, Western Australia.  In July 2008, Starbrake granted a company called Rocla Pty Ltd a lease and exclusive licence to extract sand from the Callaway Street property.  Rocla allegedly paid Starbrake $7,700,000 (inclusive of GST of $700,000) as either a royalty payment, payment for the grant of the licence, or as a prepayment for sand to be extracted from the land.22    On 17 October 2008 Starbrake lodged a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for the purposes of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act).  The BAS was referrable to the period 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008.  Starbrake did not declare, or otherwise bring to account in the BAS, the $700,000 portion of the payment received by it which represented the GST collected in relation to its supply of the licence (or extracted sand) to Rocla.23    In February 2012 Starbrake lodged its income tax return for the year ending 30 June 2009.  The income declared or disclosed in the return did not include the $7,000,000 payment (excluding GST) received from Rocla.24    The ATO conducted an audit of Starbrake.  In the course of that audit, the ATO ascertained that Starbrake’s general ledger recorded the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake as a loan from Mammoth Nominees Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director and sectary of Mammoth Nominees.  The registered office of Mammoth Nominees was Mr Caratti’s home address.  The ATO also obtained copies of emails sent to and received by Mr Joseph Catenacci, an accountant or tax agent who appears to have been retained by Starbrake.  Those emails suggested that the accounting classification of the $7,700,000 receipt by Starbrake was changed in about December 2011.  It was originally classified as income, however in December 2011 Mr Catenacci was allegedly instructed to classify the receipt as a loan from Mammoth Nominees.  25    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as sole director of Starbrake, directed the reclassification of the receipt from Rocla so as to obtain a financial benefit.  That financial benefit was said to be the understatement of Starbrake’s income for the year ending 30 June 2009, as well as the non-remittance to the ATO of the GST collected by Starbrake (the GST portion of the payment) in relation to its supply to Rocla.  That remittance should have been included as part of the BAS for the quarter ending 30 September 2008.Third suspected offence (the Westend allegations)Text in the search warrant74    The third suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:In 2008 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he falsified costs incurred by Westend Asset Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by not paying income tax, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).  Affidavit material for the third suspected offence75    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the third suspected offence were as follows:6.47    In 2009, the ATO identified that between September 2003 and December 2008, WESTEND, a company controlled by A.CARATTI, had not reported significant sales of land in Darch, Western Australia that should have been reported as before tax profits.  The ATO commenced an audit and requested information from WESTEND in relation to the discovered land sales.  In response, WESTEND produced tax invoices from MAMMOTH for the development work on the land in Darch (known as the Ashdale Mews Estate) and reported that the works were undertaken on behalf of MAMMOTH by Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd.  The tax invoices totalled $5,400,000.6.48    ASIC records indicate that WESTEND was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 29 August 2003 and that its registered office is located at 21 Genevieve Court, Halls Head WA 6210.  Josephine BAZZO (J.BAZZO), the mother of BAZZO, is the office bearer of WESTEND and holds the following positions in the company: [Director and Secretary since 1 September 2003].6.49    Landgate records indicate that in 2002, WESTEND purchased several allotments of land in Darch to undertake a residential housing development.  This land was purchased for $7,600,000 through a loan agreement with Suncorp Bank.6.50    On 28 January 2010, the ATO conducted an interview with A.CARATTI in regards to WESTEND’s Ashdale Mews Estate development and the discovered land sales.  Also in attendance at this meeting was Hendricus (Hank) SCHOKKER (SCHOKKER) born 25 March 1950, a taxation consultant for A.CARATTI.  At the interview, A.CARATTI advised the ATO that he had full authority to represent J.BAZZO and to deal with matters pertaining to WESTEND.6.51    During this interview, A.CARATTI and SCHOKKER informed the ATO that most of the works relating to the Ashdale Mews Estate development at this location were done by Mammoth Investments, as per invoices previously provided to the ATO in 2009 at the commencement of the audit.6.52    The development works undertaken on the Ashdale Mews Estate was supervised by Ewings, an external civil engineering company.  Ewings’ role was to ensure that work was satisfactorily completed and also issue payment certificates to WESTEND.6.53    The ATO’s discussions with Ewings revealed that in 2004, WESTEND awarded Mammoth Investments a contract to provide subdivision works on the Ashdale Mews Estate.  Ewings also informed the ATO that, subsequent to this initial development work by Mammoth Investments, an external company Works Infrastructure Pty Ltd (Works Infrastructure) was engaged to complete site works to the value of $1,978,000.6.54    As a result of audit activity with WESTEND and Ewings, the ATO have estimated that the total of all initial site works (Mammoth Investments, Works Infrastructure and other subcontractors) was approximately $2,400,000, with the total cost of the initial bulk earthworks by Mammoth Investments on the site being to the value of only $213,642; significantly under the value of invoices produced by WESTEND.6.55    Analysis of WESTEND’s financial reporting by ATO revealed that the $213,642 of bulk earthworks conducted by Mammoth Investments was invoiced multiple times on different versions of the same tax invoice naming MAMMOTH or Mammoth Investments as the entity performing the work.  These invoices formed part of the $5,400,000 expenses claimed by WESTEND.6.56    Further to this, analysis of financial reports by the ATO revealed that WESTEND did not make payments totalling $5,400,000.00 for work conducted by Mammoth Investments, with the invoices from Mammoth Investments treated as a loan expense by WESTEND.  No loan repayments from WESTEND to Mammoth Investments have been evidenced to date.6.57    ASIC records identify that J.CARATTI is a current office bearer of Mammoth Investments [director]…  Other Directors of Mammoth Investments include M.CARATTI (since 12 December 1997), Aaron CARATTI (since 14 May 2002) and Nicole CARATTI (since 14 May 2002).  A.CARATTI held the position of Director of this company between 14 May 2002 and 09 October 2012.6.58    In an interview between the ATO and J.CARATTI, he stated that the invoices totalling $5,400,000.00 from Mammoth Investments for the work conducted on the Ashdale Mews Estate for WESTEND were false and that A.CARATTI had created them.6.59    ATO analysis of MYOB transactions, provided to the ATO by A.CARATTI and SCHOKKER during their interviews, reveals that the $5,400,000.00 of development expenses invoiced from Mammoth Investments were created in MYOB on 15 June 2009 – after the ATO audit had  begun.6.60    The applicant suspects that A.CARATTI falsified $5,400,000 worth of invoices from Mammoth Investments, for development works already undertaken by Works Infrastructure, for the purpose of inflating expenses for the benefit of WESTEND to avoid his taxation responsibilities.  76    Thus the allegation under investigation, spelt out in some detail, was that invoices created by Mr Caratti totalling $5.4 million were false, with the true cost of work done being closer to half that sum.  The full amount of the invoices totalling $5.4 million were suspected of having been treated as an expense to reduce the tax payable on the profits of Westend Asset Pty Ltd from unreported land sales.  The suspected offence focused on the creation of the alleged false invoices, alleged to have taken place in 2008, rather than upon the point at which documents were lodged with the ATO.  As the primary judge explained:The Westend allegations 26    The second group of allegations concerned a company called Westend Asset Pty Ltd.  The sole director of Westend was Ms Bazzo’s mother, Ms Josephine Bazzo.  Beyond that somewhat indirect connection, there was apparently no evidence to suggest that Mr Caratti had any direct or indirect interest in Westend.  Despite this, it appears that the AFP alleged that Westend was controlled by Mr Caratti.   27    In 2002, Westend purchased land in Darch, Western Australia, for the purposes of undertaking a residential housing development.  It would appear that the land cost somewhere in the order of $7,600,000.  The residential development became known as the Ashdale Mews Estate development.  The development apparently proceeded and in due course Westend sold the developed parcels of land.  Those sales were said to have occurred between September 2003 and December 2008. 28    The ATO commenced an audit of Westend in 2009.  In the course of that audit it was ascertained that Westend had not reported or declared the land sales as part of its business operations for tax purposes.  It had not declared any before tax profits made from its sales of the developed land.  29    In the course of the audit, Westend provided the ATO with copies of tax invoices from Mammoth Nominees addressed to Westend for work supposedly carried out in relation to the development.  Those tax invoices totalled $5,400,000.  Presumably the invoices were provided for the purpose of demonstrating that the expenses reflected in the invoices reduced any pre-tax profit made by Westend from the development.30    During an interview conducted by the ATO in January 2010, Mr Caratti and his tax agent, Mr Hendricus Schokker, told the ATO that the development work reflected in the invoices was in fact carried out by a company called Mammoth Investments Pty Ltd, supposedly on behalf of Mammoth Nominees.  Mr Caratti and various members of his family were directors of Mammoth Investments.31    The allegation being investigated as part of operation Caballus was that the invoices totalling $5,400,000 were false.  An analysis conducted by the ATO from financial records and other information revealed that the cost of any work carried out by Mammoth Investments totalled just over $2,000,000; that Westend never paid Mammoth Investments (or Mammoth Nominees) $5,400,000 in respect of any works, but that the invoices were nevertheless treated as a loan expense; and that the invoices were created in June 2009, after the ATO’s audit had commenced.  Mr Caratti’s brother, Mr John Caratti, told the ATO in the course of an interview that the invoices were false and were created by Mr Caratti.  32    It was alleged, in short, that Mr Caratti created the false invoices to inflate Westend’s expenses in relation to the development and therefore reduce any tax liability in respect of profits earned by Westend from the development.Fourth suspected offence (the Whitby Land Company allegations)Text in the search warrant77    The fourth suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI by a deception, in that he caused the Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd to withhold Goods and Services Tax, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Section 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material for the fourth suspected offence78    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the fourth suspected offence were as follows:6.76    ASIC records indicate that WHITBY was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 11 July 2005 and that its registered office is located at 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.6.77    ASIC records identify that A.CARATTI is a current office bearer of Whitby…6.78    Other directors of WHITBY include Liang LI (LI) (since 14 March 2011) and Christina CARATTI (C.CARATTI) (since 01 January 2013), A.CARATTI’s daughter.6.79    Landgate records indicate that in January 2008, WHITBY acquired land identified as Lot 22 on Diagram 4515, certificate of volume 1353 and folio 245, located at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, WA 6112.…6.83    In 2012, an ATO audit of WHITBY, obtaining financial and business records, revealed the land at Lot 22, Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, is being developed and subdivided into residential lots.  Financial records analysed by the ATO have revealed that between 2011 and 2012, WHITBY sold 113 residential lots as part of this development, resulting in approximately $23,766,818 in sales.  The ATO has deemed this as assessable income.6.84    The ATO have advised the AFP that WHITBY did not register with the ATO for a Tax File Number (TFN), Australian Business Number (ABN) or GST when it was registered as a company in 2005.  WHITBY remained unregistered for taxation purposes until the ATO registered it for a TFN on 6 October 2012 and an ABN and GST on 3 November 2012.  The applicant suspects that by failing to register WHITBY for tax purposes, A.CARATTI was attempting to conceal potential income and avoid his taxation responsibilities.6.85    On 24 March 2010, Wilson and Atkinson Law Firm oversaw the production of documents produced by A.CARATTI to ATO auditors.  Within these documents was a deed of trust in relation to WHITBY.  It was executed as a deed and signed by A.CARATTI on 15 November 2007.  MAMMOTH of 2 Duncraig Rd, Applecross was listed as the beneficiary in relation to the property described as Lot 22, 293, Nicholson Rd, Forestdale.  This document was witness by SCHOKKER.6.86    The ATO estimate that for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years, the land development undertaken by WHITBY has resulted in net taxable income of approximately $8,161,390.  The ATO assessed a GST liability of approximately $1,425,497.6.87    The ATO have advised that even though WHITBY has not advised sales of land or declared income in relation to its development for the 2012 financial year, MAMMOTH submitted claims to the ATO for income tax deductions in that year with respect to the development of land being undertaken by WHITBY at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, WA.6.88    ATO analysis of documents obtained from WHITBY accountants, Macri Partners (MACRI) with regard to MAMMOTH’s claim for income tax deductions identify that MAMMOTH are claiming approximately $50,000,000 attributable to the development of the Nicholson Road land.6.89    About 27 to 29 November 2012, WHITBY lodged BAS statements to the ATO covering 2011/12 financial year for WHITBY through their accountants MACRI.  These statements were rejected as the ATO was in the process of issuing assessments with respect to WHITBY’s taxation liability.  The applicant suspects that the BAS statements were only lodged in response to ATO audit activity in an attempt to a taxation debt.…79    The allegation under investigation was therefore that Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd, at Mr Caratti’s instigation, sold land worth almost $24 million, but that the goods and services tax (GST) due on that sum of about $1.5 million was never reported or remitted as required.  The allegation is that Mr Caratti deliberately and dishonestly brought that about in the period between the middle of 2010 and the end of 2013.  As the primary judge explained:Whitby Land Company allegations 33    The third group of allegations concerned a company called Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd.  Mr Caratti was a director of Whitby Land Company.  34    In January 2008, Whitby Land Company acquired land at 293 Nicholson Road, Forrestdale, Western Australia.  It would appear that Whitby Land Company subdivided and developed the Nicholson Road land into residential lots.  The lots were subsequently sold for a total amount of about $24,000,000.  Those sales appear to have occurred during 2011 and 2012.  35    Despite its involvement in the enterprise responsible for the development and sale of the Nicholson Road land, Whitby Land Company was never registered under the GST Act.  It follows that it never reported or remitted any GST payable and collected by it in respect of its supply of the developed lots.  The ATO assessed Whitby Land Company’s GST liability as being in the order of $1.5 million. 36    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti, as a director of Whitby Land Company, deliberately failed to register Whitby Land Company for GST and deliberately failed to remit the GST portion of the consideration it received from the land sales.  Fifth suspected offence (the Gucce Holdings allegations)Text in the search warrant80    The fifth suspected offence was stated in the warrants as follows:In December 2011 at Perth in Western Australia, Allen CARATTI and Tina BAZZO, by a deception, in that they falsified costs incurred by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd, attempted to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage by overstating Goods and Services Tax input credits, from another person, namely the Australian Taxation Office, which is a Commonwealth entity, contrary to Sections 11.1 and 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 [sic] (Cth).Affidavit material in relation to the fifth suspected offence81    The relevant parts of Federal Agent Szolnoki’s affidavit concerning the fifth suspected offence were as follows:6.110    ASIC records indicate that FOREST HOPE was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 31 October 2006 and that its principal place of business is 48 Wickham Street, East Perth, WA 6004.6.111    ASIC records identify that BAZZO is the current director of the company, appointed 27 July 2011, recorded against 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.  A.CARATTI has also been an office holder of FOREST HOPE holding the following position: [Director: 31/10/2006 – 27/07/2011]6.112    ASIC records indicate that Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd (GUCCE) was registered as an Australian proprietary company on 7 January 2002 and that its registered office is 48 Wickham Street, East Perth, WA 6004…6.113    ASIC records indicate that BAZZO is the current sole director and secretary of GUCCE.  BAZZO is recorded against 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross, WA 6153.  A.CARATTI is recorded as a previous director of GUCCE, between the dates 17 January 2002 and 01 February 2002, A.CARATTI is recorded against 517 Great Eastern Highway, Redcliffe, WA 6104.6.114    In December 2009, a Joint Venture (JV) agreement between GUCCE and FOREST HOPE.  The joint venture was a land subdivision of Lot 9029 Broadway, Aveley, WA 6069 (known as Aveley Green), of which GUCCE owned a fifty percent share.6.115    Between 28 July 2011 and 16 November 2012, works were undertaken as per the terms of the JV.  As part of the works, civil and earth works were undertaken in the process of subdividing the land.  MAMMOTH were hired by GUCCE to complete these works.  During the process of the subdivision, MAMMOTH issued 40 invoices to GUCCE and FORREST HOPE for the works completed, as per the terms of the JV.6.116    The 40 invoices, contained invoice numbers, total cost including GST, works completed and what stage of the project the invoice related to.  Each invoice was signed by an independent site supervisor, who confirmed the costs charged for each invoice.6.117    The total cost for works completed, as signed on the 40 invoices by the independent site supervisor was $15,040,672.14, including GST of $1,367,344.6.118    Between 17 August 2011 and 31 December 2012, GUCCE paid $14,153,499.33 for the works undertaken by MAMMOTH.6.119    In May 2013, the ATO commenced an audit of GUCCE after it was identified that GUCCE had incorrectly reported income to the ATO.6.120    As a result of the ATO audit, it was identified that GUCCE, in relation to the JV, had claimed GST input credits totalling $2,218,953.22.  To support this claim, GUCCE provided the ATO with stage by stage reconciliation of initial costs, per developed lot, completed through SLS Accounting.  This included invoices for works undertaken by MAMMOTH, relating to the JV, totalling $22,847,181.25.6.121    ATO analysis of the cost breakdown schedules and [redacted citing public interest immunity] that the transaction amounts are higher than the certified work, including higher contract prices, added work items and higher unit prices.6.122    As works totalling $15,040,672.14 had been verified by the independent site supervisor, the applicant suspects that BAZZO and A.CARATTI on behalf of GUCCE and MAMMOTH, have colluded to create false invoices for the works undertaken, in order to claim GST input credits and reduce taxable income, resulting in GUCCE / MAMMOTH obtaining a financial advantage.  The income reported by MAMMOTH to the ATO, did not match the expenses listed by GUCCE.6.123    The applicant suspects that GUCCE deliberately overstated GST credits in relation to FOREST HOPE, by forming an agreement with MAMMOTH, which resulted in the creation of invoices, in order to dishonestly obtain a benefit from the ATO.6.124    Inquiries with ASIC reveal that MAMMOTH is registered at 2 Duncraig Road, Applecross WA 6153 with Allen Bruce CARATTI as Director and Secretary, A.CARATTI is recorded against 517 Great Eastern Highway WA 6104.…82    The allegation under investigation is that the claiming of input tax credits was brought about by Mr Caratti and supported by Ms Bazzo by the provision of false invoices, with the focus being on when the false documents were alleged to have been created.  As the primary judge explained:The Gucce Holdings allegations 37    The fourth group of allegations concerned two companies:  Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd and Forest Hope Pty Ltd.  Ms Bazzo was a director of both companies.  Mr Caratti had been a director of Gucce Holdings, though at a time well before the events the subject of the relevant allegations.  He was a director of Forest Hope up to a time just before the most significant events the subject of the investigation.38    In December 2009, Gucce Holdings and Forrest Hope entered into a joint venture agreement in relation to the subdivision of land in Avery, Western Australia.  Gucce had a 50% interest in that land. 39    Gucce Holdings retained Mammoth Nominees to do civil and earth works in relation to the subdivision.  Mammoth Nominees issued forty invoices to Gucce Holdings and Forest Hope in relation to the works.  The invoices totalled $15,040,672.14, including GST of $1,367,344.  Each of the invoices was signed-off by an independent site supervisor.  Between August 2011 and December 2012, Gucce Holdings paid $14,153,499.33 to Mammoth in respect of the work.40    In May 2013, the ATO commenced an audit of Gucce Holdings.  During the audit it was ascertained that Gucce Holdings had claimed input tax credits under the GST Act in respect of the works carried out by Mammoth Nominees.  The input tax credits claimed by Gucce Holdings totalled $2,218,953.22.  In simple terms, the amount of the input tax credits to which Gucce Holdings was legitimately entitled to claim equalled the amount of the GST it paid in respect of Mammoth Nominee’s supplies: see s 11-25 and s 17-5 of the GST Act.  It appeared that Gucce Holdings had claimed more input tax credits than it was legitimately able to claim.41    In the course of the audit, Gucce Holdings endeavoured to support its entitlement to claim input tax credits referable to the supplies by Mammoth Nominees by providing detailed information, including invoices, suggesting that Gucce had in fact paid $22,847,181 to Mammoth Nominees for the works.  That was a considerably larger amount than the amount reflected in the 40 invoices signed off by the independent site supervisor. 42    The allegation being investigated was that Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo colluded to overstate the input tax credits which Gucce was entitled to claim and created false invoices to substantiate that claim.  The execution of the search warrants83    The execution of the search warrants was carried out over three days between 28 and 30 January 2015, resulting in the seizure of a large number of documents and other items, mainly computers and electronic storage devices.  Several features of the process of execution, as recorded in the primary judge’s findings, should be noted: (1)    Prior to the execution of the search warrants, it was decided by Federal Agent Nicholson that it would be beneficial to have the assistance of tax officers with some background knowledge of the business and tax affairs of Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.(2)    On 22 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson distributed a draft Standard Tactical Plan to Federal Agents who were rostered to participate in the execution of the search warrants.  That document included background information concerning Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo and details of the offences in terms relevantly identical to the terms of the third condition of the warrants.(3)    On 27 January 2015, Federal Agent Nicholson delivered a briefing to the Federal Agents and tax officers who were expected to be involved in the execution of the warrants.  (4)    Prior to execution, some “premises-specific” briefings were also conducted by certain “Team Leaders”, although it appears that this involved little more than the team leaders reading out the third condition offences.(5)    A large number of tax officers ultimately assisted in the execution of the warrants, acting as “constables assisting” for the purposes of Part IAA of the Crimes Act.  (6)    Tax officers – Mr Peter Irvin and Ms Amanda Milner – assisted in the execution of the warrants at the premises at Wickham Street, East Perth.  Mr Irvin’s involvement with the execution at those premises relevantly included distributing to at least some of the officers assisting a document intended to aid searches by informing them of some of the background to the allegations that were the subject of the warrant (Search Relevances document).Grounds of appeal84    The first and second grounds of appeal renew the attack on the offence descriptions in the third condition of the search warrants, both as to validity on their face, and as to whether such a condition, so expressed, was authorised by the material before the issuing magistrate.  The third ground attacks the primary judge’s finding as to severability of any of the offences in the third condition.  The fourth ground renews the attack on the execution of the search warrants in particular respects.  The fifth ground attacks the primary judge’s solution to the problem with electronic devices being unlawfully seized, which was effectively to allow the Commissioner to do what would have been permitted and should have been done in the first place under the statutory regime for copying and examining data stored on a computer.85    Given the close connection between the first and second grounds of appeal, concerning different aspects of the offence description in the third condition, it is convenient to set out the competing arguments for both, but to address them in combination.  First and second appeal grounds – the offence descriptions:•    The search warrants were invalid on their face by reason of the offence descriptions (ground 1; whole of ground 1B below)•    The issue of the search warrants was invalid by reason that the offence descriptions were broader than justified by the information before the issuing officer (ground 2; whole of ground 1A below)First and second appeal grounds as pleaded 86    Mr Caratti’s first ground of appeal is stated as follows:  His Honour erred in finding that the Warrants were valid on their face, in finding that they sufficiently specified the perimeters within which materials were able to be searched for and seized and that they were capable of sufficiently informing the occupiers of the relevant premises of the authorised area of the search and seizure: [162], [238], [483].Particulars as to [alleged erroneous] conclusions on each offence in the Third Condition of the Warrants(i)    The description of the first offence in the Third Condition, which related to Starbrake Pty Limited, was sufficient to enable an occupier to discern a search perimeter relevant to the offence: [133].(ii)    When read in conjunction with the first offence, it would have been tolerably clear to the reader of the second offence in the Third Condition that the alleged GST liability in the description of that offence related to the royalty income received Starbrake Pty Limited, and that the dishonesty arose from the alleged reclassification of that income.  The gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the second offence were sufficiently apparent to identify the object or area of the search: [139]-[140], [145].(iii)    The third offence, which related to Westend Asset Pty Limited, was particularised such that the gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence were sufficiently apparent to identify the object or area of the search: [145].(iv)    The description of the fourth offence related to Whitby Land Company Pty Limited was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that it define or provide a meaningful or intelligible search perimeter: [152].(v)    On balance there is sufficient particularity and clarity in the description of the fifth offence in the Third Condition, related to Gucce Holdings Pty Limited, to indicate the area of search permitted by the warrants: [159].87    Mr Caratti’s second ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in finding that the search perimeter permitted by the Warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer: [175], [189]-[193], [199], [238], [482]. Findings of the primary judge relevant to the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)88    In relation to ground 1B below, which is revisited as the first ground of appeal, the primary judge considered that the description of each of the suspected offences in the third condition of the warrants was sufficient to define adequately the area of search.  This conclusion was reached notwithstanding a number of issues his Honour identified with the drafting of the descriptions.  In particular, those descriptions were considered to be “ambiguous or unclear” in places and showed a very poor appreciation of the terms of the underlying tax legislation, demonstrated by repeated erroneous reference to the Australian Taxation Office as the relevant legal entity, ambiguity in the particularisation of the date on which some of the alleged conduct was said to have occurred, and the description of several offences in terms of “withholding” or failing to pass on GST, the meaning of which was not readily clear or consistent with any concept in the GST legislation.89    Despite these and other concerns about the drafting of the warrants, his Honour concluded that the suspected offences were sufficiently disclosed to avoid invalidity.  His Honour emphasised that the Court’s role was to approach the descriptions broadly and without overzealous technicality, and to consider the descriptions fairly and in the context of each warrant as a whole.  In respect of each suspected offence, his Honour placed weight on the fact that the descriptions included the name or names of the persons accused of the offences, the relevant offence provision, some temporal particularisation, and the general “gist” of the offending conduct.  In other words, the focus was on the substantive conduct being investigated, even if it did not conform accurately or precisely to the legal incidence or effect of what was said to have occurred.90    Because the paragraphs cited in the second appeal ground make clear why this particular aspect of review ground 1B before the primary judge failed, and because the appeal in this respect turns on the conclusions his Honour reached, it is necessary to examine the text of each paragraph of his Honour’s reasons.  For each, Mr Caratti must show not merely that a different conclusion was open, but that the conclusion reached was wrong and therefore not available to his Honour.  91    The particular paragraphs of the primary judge’s reasons complained of in the second ground of appeal do not need to be reproduced, but can be summarised as follows:(1)    At [175], his Honour rejected Mr Caratti’s characterisation of the offences in the third condition as “discrete transactions” as being neither fair nor accurate, describing them instead as four allegations involving relatively complex facts and conduct extending over a period of time – his Honour therefore concluded that there was no need to limit the issue of warrants to discrete transactions.  (2)    At [189]-[190], his Honour considered the first two “Starbrake” offences in the third condition and concluded that, while a technical approach might lead to a conclusion that the focus on 2008 was erroneous and that different dates might have been fixed upon, that date was when the conduct giving rise to the alleged fraud took place.  Accordingly, at least some of the factual or legal elements of each offence took place in 2008 and there was no error in focussing on that date, even if other dates might have been used because aspects of the fraud alleged took place later in time.(3)    At [191]-[193], his Honour considered the third “Westend” offence in the third condition, and similarly concluded that while dates other than 2008 might have been relied upon, again at least part of that offence was referrable to that year.(4)    At [199], his Honour made the point that while the offences in the third condition could have been drafted in narrower terms or with different dates or date ranges, and that the words and dates used lacked clarity and particularity, the information before the issuing officer was capable of satisfying the criteria for the issue of the search warrants.(5)    At [238], as relevant to this appeal ground, his Honour summarised an aspect of the conclusions reached to the effect that the search warrants were not invalid on the basis that it was not open to the issuing officer to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that evidential material referrable to the third condition would be at the premises.(6)    At [482], as relevant to this appeal ground, his Honour again stated the conclusion that the information before the issuing officer was sufficient to support a finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there was, at the relevant premises, things with respect to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting they would afford evidence of the commission of the offences in the third condition, and that Mr Caratti had not proved otherwise.  Subject to a severance finding as to a paragraph making an invalid reference to seizure of “any storage medium”, the search permitted did not exceed what was justified by the material before the issuing officer.92    In relation to ground 1A below, which is revisited as the second ground of appeal, the primary judge rejected the contention made by Mr Caratti that the search area identified by the warrants was broader than what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer.  In advancing that argument, Mr Caratti placed considerable reliance on the obiter dicta of Fox J in R v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (1969) 14 FLR 101 at 125, where his Honour, having concluded that the relevant search warrants were invalid by reason of certain defects, proceeded to make the following observations: As to the area of the search, I believe that the requirements are flexible.  If, as is now likely to be the case, the issue of the warrant rests on statutory authority, the content of the warrant is governed by the statute and must not only comply with the more specific requirements thereof, but it should not be wider than is necessary to carry out the manifest legislative purpose.  In a case under s 10(b), for example, it would be wrong to issue a warrant which authorized a general search of bank premises, when the information pointed to one forged cheque.  Even a search for all documents relating to a particular account may be too wide.  There should be no limitation on an adequate search, but it is a function of the information to show how wide that search may have to be, and the function of the justice to ensure that his warrant does not authorize anything wider.  Each case must depend upon its own facts.93    The primary judge did not accept that Fox J was intending to lay down a rigid test concerning the permitted area of search and seizure of a warrant.  His Honour stated:171    It should be noted that the search warrant in question in Tillett purported to permit the search of bank premises and the seizure of “books, papers, documents or other things” as to which there were “reasonable grounds for believing that the same will afford evidence of the commission of an offence against the Commonwealth Crimes Act”.  No specific offence was specified.  There was effectively no limitation on the books, papers, documents and things that could be searched for and seized.  It is not surprising, in those circumstances, that the warrant was found to be defective.  The observations of Fox J should be considered in that context. 172    It is readily apparent that Fox J was not intending to lay down any rigid test concerning the issue of search warrants or the permitted area of search and seizure.  As his Honour said, the “requirements are flexible”, the “content of the warrant is governed by the statute” in question and that “each case must be governed by its own facts”.  His Honour’s reference to the warrant not being “wider than necessary”, and the issuing officer’s function being to ensure that the warrant does not authorise “anything wider”, must be read as meaning anything wider than permitted under the relevant statutory provision, properly construed.  Contrary to Mr Caratti’s submission, Tillet is not authority for the much broader proposition that the offence specified in a search warrant must be particularised in the narrowest possible terms supported by the information before the issuing officer.94    His Honour considered that the relevant question was whether the information before the issuing officer was capable of satisfying the officer, in simplified terms, that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that there were things at the premises that would afford evidence of the commission of the offences specified in the warrants.  It was accepted that, as considered in George v Rockett at 117, the more broadly a warrant describes the kinds of evidential material to be searched for, the more difficult it might be for the information before the issuing officer to satisfy this requirement.  However, his Honour held that it would not be impermissible to describe the object of the search in a broad, non-specific fashion, citing Dunesky v Elder at 555E-F.Appellant’s submissions on the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)95    The central contention advanced by Mr Caratti on his first ground of appeal was that the descriptions of the suspected offences in the warrants give rise to “intolerable ambiguity” because they are capable of two different meanings and of defining two different search areas.  Accordingly, it was submitted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the statement of the offences was sufficient to meet the requirement expressed in Zhang v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2009] FCA 1170; 260 ALR 580; 111 ALD 123; 77 ATR 713 at [13] that the descriptions provide “real and meaningful perimeters to the ‘area of search’”.  That view was in part drawn from Beneficial Finance at 543.  In the present case, it was submitted that the use of the “three-condition” search warrant as a drafting device gave rise to a greater need for particularisation, having regard to the broadly drafted first and second conditions of the search warrant.96    In support of the contention that the warrants gave rise to “intolerable” ambiguity, counsel drew a distinction between language that is “infelicitous” or “inelegant” and language that is “unintelligible” or “ambiguous”.  Ambiguity, it was submitted, would render a warrant invalid, citing the statement in Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 107 that a warrant will be “bad” if it is “so vaguely worded that a person affected by it cannot know the object of the search”.  Reliance was also placed on Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301; 111 FCR 175 at [156], Parker v Churchill (in the Full Court) at 340.8 and Corbett at [106]. 97    In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Caratti addressed the principle espoused by Burchett J in Beneficial Finance that a legally incorrect formulation in a search warrant will not necessarily invalidate the warrant.  It was submitted that this principle is qualified by a requirement that the warrant be plainly comprehensible, as expressed at 543, where his Honour stated (emphasis added):… If the courts were to insist upon the invalidation of a warrant for a legally incorrect formulation of an offence, although the substance of the offence could plainly be understood, they would not be interpreting the will of the Parliament but subverting it.98    The main species of ambiguity said to affect the search area of the warrants in the present case arises primarily from the imprecision of the time periods specified for some of the suspected offences.  In this regard, the force of the appellant’s submissions was directed towards the first and second offences, which were described in the warrants as having occurred “in 2008” and concern Mr Caratti’s suspected reclassification of royalty income as a loan to avoid paying income tax and the suspected failure of his company Starbrake “to pass on” GST.  The relevant asserted ambiguity, as identified by the primary judge, is said to arise in the following manner:  (1)    In relation to the first offence, it is unclear whether the particularised date of 2008 refers to the date on which the alleged deceptive conduct occurred (either the accounting reclassification of the royalty payment, or perhaps the lodging of a false tax return that did not declare the royalty income), or the date on which the financial advantage was allegedly obtained.  That date would be the date on which the tax would, but for the deception, have been assessed as payable.  (2)    In relation to the second offence, the description of the contravening conduct as a failure to “pass on” GST gives rise to similar difficulties in ascertaining what conduct is in fact being referred to, noting that the GST legislation does not refer to GST being “collected”, nor does it create or refer to an obligation to “pass on” GST.  On appeal, Mr Caratti submits that this imprecision means that there are multiple interpretations possible as to what the time period “in 2008” refers to.  99    Counsel for Mr Caratti directed the Court to the primary judge’s reasons at [131], where, having identified the relevant ambiguities, his Honour emphasised that:… the question of the sufficiency of the description of the offences in the warrant is not to be approached as if the warrant was an indictment and the issue was the legal sufficiency of the pleading.  The exercise involved in determining whether the description of the offences in a search warrant is sufficient is not to be approached as if it was a demurrer.  Nor is it a counsel of perfection.  Rather, as already indicated, the question is whether, viewed broadly and not perversely or with undue technicality, the general nature of the offences is sufficiently disclosed so as to indicate the authorised area of search.100    The vice said to be disclosed in the approach adopted above is that the primary judge was said to have committed an error of principle in dealing with the issue as a question of the sufficiency of the particulars supplied, instead of grappling with the proper question of whether the descriptions were impermissibly ambiguous.  In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Caratti submitted that the test of “adequacy” involves two parts: first, whether there is sufficiency of particularity; and second, whether the warrant is free from ambiguity, in the sense of the warrant having two meanings.  Accordingly, it is said that although the primary judge identified ambiguity in the warrants, his Honour failed to recognise that such ambiguity might “intolerably” give rise to two different meanings and two different areas of search.  Further error is also said to have been disclosed by the primary judge in finding that a reader of the warrants would perceive a connection between the first and second offences.  101    Reliance was also placed on asserted ambiguities in the balance of the offences as follows:(1)    In relation to the third offence concerning a suspected failure by Westend Asset Pty Ltd to pay income tax, it was asserted that the primary judge erred in concluding that the gist or substance of the key factual allegations that underlay the offence was sufficiently clear, in circumstances where his Honour considered that, if the offence were an indictment, the prosecution would be required to clarify exactly what was alleged to have occurred in 2008: whether it was the falsification of the costs, or the lodgement of the relevant income tax return, or whether 2008 simply referred to the relevant income. (2)    In relation to the fourth offence concerning a suspected “withholding” of GST by Whitby Land Company Pty Ltd, it is asserted that intolerable ambiguity arises because it is unclear what is meant by “withholding” GST, an expression which does not readily accord with any concept in the GST legislation.  It was further submitted that this formulation gives rise to temporal ambiguity, in that it is not clear whether the period “between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2013” refers to, for example, the period of failure to register GST, GST tax periods, or the dates when the BAS were due to be lodged and net amounts due to be paid.(3)    In relation to the fifth offence concerning an alleged overstatement of GST input credits by Gucce Holdings Pty Ltd “in December 2011”, it is asserted that the description is ambiguous as to what occurred in that time period.  For example, the offence might refer to when it was agreed that costs be falsified, the actual falsification of costs, the GST tax period to which the falsified costs relate, the date when BAS were due to be lodged and net amounts due to be paid, or the date when BAS were in fact lodged.102    In his second ground of appeal, Mr Caratti also asserted error in the primary judge’s conclusion that the search area permitted by the warrants did not exceed what was reasonably justified by the material before the issuing officer.  In support of that assertion, it was said that, applying the reasoning in George v Rockett at 116.4 – 119.2 to the statutory language of the Crimes Act, a warrant is “unjustifiably wide” if, in respect of the evidential material to be searched for, the supporting affidavit material did not provide reasonable grounds for suspecting that the material would be at the relevant premises nor reasonable grounds for suspecting that the material would afford evidence as to the commission of the offence.  It was noted that the statutory language of “will afford” in s 3E of the Crimes Act echoes the provisions that were considered in George v Rockett.  In this regard, it was emphasised that the more broadly a warrant describes the kinds of evidential material to be searched for, the more difficult it might be to meet this requirement.  103    It was suggested that a search area might be broader than justified by the material before the issuing officer in two circumstances.  First, where the offence defines a search perimeter that is different from what was intended or supported; and secondly, where the lack of particularity in the language of the offence results in a failure to confine the search area to what was justified. 104    The area covered by the search warrants in the present case was (again) said to be broader than justified by the affidavit material before the issuing officer as follows: (1)    The first suspected offence should not have referred to 2008 as the date of reclassification of royalty income, in circumstances where the material before the issuing officer justified a charge founded on that reclassification occurring in late 2011 or early 2012, albeit in respect of tax liability arising in 2008.  Moreover, the material before the issuing officer suggested that the offence constituted a single, discrete royalty transaction, while the offence description did not refer to or confine itself to any transaction.  (2)    The second suspected offence similarly did not refer and was not confined to the royalty transaction that was the subject of the affidavit material.  Likewise, the date of the offence should not have been stated as the calendar year “2008” in circumstances where the affidavit material (which suggested a failure to report income at the end of the relevant financial year) did not support an offence occurring prior to 1 July 2008.(3)    The third suspected offence should not have referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the subject of the affidavit material was a single transaction, being the falsification of costs from Mammoth Pty Ltd totalling $5.4 million.  Accordingly, it was said that the primary judge erred at [179] in concluding that “the offence also involved other conduct and circumstances that provided necessary context and background to the alleged falsification of costs”.  (4)    The fourth suspected offence referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the affidavit material suggested a contravention constituted by a single transaction, being the failure to register GST payable to the ATO.  Moreover, the offence was also broader than justified having regard to the deficiency in the particulars of the factual allegations, which did not provide, as noted by the primary judge at [153], “any, or any meaningful, particulars of how Whitby Land Company’s GST liability arose and why Mr Caratti’s withholding of amounts payable by Whitby Land Company was deceptive and dishonest”. (5)    The fifth suspected offence referred, without proper confinement, to “withholding” GST, in circumstances where the affidavit material concerned falsified costs that could be confined to a particular project and particular invoices. Respondent’s submissions on the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)105    In relation to the first appeal ground, the Commissioner submitted that the statement of an offence in a warrant need not meet a high bar.  The required approach is instead “broad” and “practical”: Beneficial Finance at 538.  The approach “eschews overzealous technicality”: Beneficial Finance at 543.  The question is one of substance, even if the offence is given a legally incorrect formulation: Beneficial Finance at 533-535; Corbett at [1].  The true principle is that the warrant “should disclose the nature of the offence” sufficiently.106    The Commissioner made a number of submissions in turn about the sufficiency of the description of each offence in the warrants.  Generally, the Commissioner emphasised that the warrants were to be read as a whole and in a practical way.  It was said that language is inherently ambiguous, and the test for validity of a warrant is not and has never been that the offence relied upon is identified without any ambiguity.107    In respect of each offence, the Commissioner reiterated the primary judge’s findings that the warrants identified some temporal range, the person suspected of committing the offence, the relevant provisions said to have been contravened, and the “gist” or nature of the relevant course of conduct.  108    Specific submissions in respect of the description of each of the offences were advanced on behalf of the Commissioner as follows:(1)    In relation to the first and second suspected offences, it was submitted that it was not necessary for the warrants to specify with precision what was relied on as having occurred in 2008, as the matter was at an investigation stage and precisely what had occurred could not have been known.  It was further submitted that the warrants sufficiently directed searchers to look for material from, in, or around 2008 connected to the reclassification of royalty income paid to Starbrake Pty Ltd.(2)    In relation to the third suspected offence, it was emphasised that invalidity is especially unlikely to arise by reason of the ambiguities identified, where the subject matter of the offence is otherwise clearly identified, being the falsification of costs by a named entity and failure to pay tax.  (3)    In relation to the fourth and fifth suspected offences, it was submitted that any reasonable reader of the warrants would have understood the reference to “withholding” GST to refer to a failure to pay GST to the ATO.  No real ambiguity was said to arise from this natural reading.109    As to the second ground of appeal, the Commissioner submitted that the warrant affidavits provided a sufficient basis for the issuing officer to issue the warrants, setting out material from which it was open to conclude that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion that Mr Caratti had engaged in the various contraventions.  It was further submitted that the primary judge asked the very question which the appellant says should have been asked, namely, whether the offences stated in the warrants were “broader than justified by the information”.  The reason why his Honour addressed ambiguities in the drafting of the warrants when considering this issue was because of the way Mr Caratti put his case.110    It was also submitted that Mr Caratti’s reliance on the words “will afford” used in George v Rockett is misplaced.  It was said that the issuing officer may only issue a warrant if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is or will be “evidential material” at the premises, as the expression does not call for precise correspondence between evidential material that the issuing officer suspects will be at the relevant premises and the offence specified in the warrant.  111    The submissions for the Commissioner are correct as far as they go, but they do not properly grapple with the substance of the complaint being made, or with the solution to that complaint arrived at by the primary judge, or with the limited nature of appeals by way of rehearing, and the requirement for error to be established.  That is largely left to reliance on his Honour’s reasoning.Consideration of the first and second appeal grounds (offence descriptions)112    An immediate point to be made about the submissions made on behalf of Mr Caratti is that they amount to little more than pointing to the conclusions that the primary judge might have reached, but did not, if the focus in the drafting of the third condition had been clearer on the technical aspects of the offences as they would need to be proved and therefore might ultimately be charged.  That approach, in substance, although disavowed in form, of requiring search warrant offences to comply with the formal and exacting characteristics of criminal charges or indictments (here in the context of the law of taxation) has been repeatedly rejected as the authorities summarised above make clear.  113    This approach also did not properly grapple with the central part of his Honour’s reasoning, which was to look at the breadth of material before the issuing officer and to note that the conduct in question had a number of different facets stretching over a period of time, with the offence descriptions focusing more on an aspect of the conduct rather than its totality.  His Honour effectively concluded that it was open to have a search warrant that focused on a part of the period in which material conduct contributing to the commission of an offence was suspected to have taken place.  No error in that approach has been demonstrated.  That is particularly so when regard is had to the nature of the conduct under investigation, as spelt out in the affidavit used to obtain the search warrants, key parts of which are reproduced above.114    Neither the affidavit nor the search warrants, while not highly detailed, exact or precise in the manner of Mr Caratti’s complaint, were required to meet such an exacting standard.  Rather, they were to be read beneficially, and without overzealous technicality.  While greater clarity doubtless would have been better for all concerned, including this Court both at first instance and on appeal, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the search warrants were in aid of a criminal investigation being conducted by police officers assisted by tax officers, not a curial process conducted by lawyers.  What was required was sufficient material giving rise to conjecture or surmise that material would be found that would afford evidence of the commission of each of the named offences, and that the suspected offences stated in the search warrants sufficiently identified what was being investigated to limit the ambit of the search and any seizure that might follow.  It is general warrants that must be avoided, not warrants that lack the precision of, for example, curial processes, either civil or criminal.115    The primary judge was correct to conclude that the necessary bar for validity had been met both as to the sufficiency of the material before the issuing officer and in the adequacy of the offence descriptions contained in the search warrants that were issued.  This was a difficult value judgment that was open for his Honour to make, especially as his Honour, at [246], correctly rejected the submission made on behalf of the Commissioner that s 3E created only a “low bar” for the issue of a valid search warrant.  116    The primary judge properly expressed concern at the poor quality of the drafting and the problems that had resulted, including the need for detailed consideration and analysis by his Honour of a kind that should not have been necessary.  His Honour did not lightly come to the conclusion that the search warrants were sufficiently supported by the material in the affidavit, nor to the conclusion that the offence descriptions in the search warrants were adequate, if not ideal.  Those conclusions were fairly open to his Honour.117    In particular, it was open to the primary judge to conclude that the offence descriptions sufficiently disclosed the substance and nature of the suspected offences, notwithstanding the lack of clarity arising by reason of reference to “withholding” or failing to pass on GST, expressions which were not consistent with any concept in the GST legislation.  Again, the submissions on behalf of Mr Caratti did not go further than suggesting that the primary judge did not reach the preferable conclusion.  Accordingly, no error on his Honour’s part has been identified.  It should be emphasised that, as was observed by the primary judge, the statement of the offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision of an indictment.  The standard required is to be informed by the real object of the third condition of the warrants, namely, to identify the kind of offences alleged: Dunesky v Elder at 557C.  118    Similarly, the continued insistence on behalf of Mr Caratti that dates of the kind that might be found in a criminal charge or indictment were required misses the point of having an offence description which generally, but sufficiently, describes the conduct under investigation, so as to frame and confine the area of the search and any seizure.  None of the offence descriptions took the search inquiry beyond the conduct being investigated and the supporting affidavit material.  To the contrary, the focus was perhaps more on the time at which key aspects of the conduct took place than on the time of legal incidence of fraud to which the suspected offences related.  Viewed in this way, the offence descriptions were narrower in time than might validly have been used.  119    There could have been no complaint if the date range for each of the suspected offences had started from the earliest possible date and ended at the latest possible date, perhaps qualified by “about” to make it clear that, at the investigative stage at least, such precision was neither possible nor necessary.  It is worth observing in that regard that approximate dates or date ranges, rather than precise dates, are often used in criminal charges and indictments, although sometimes greater precision is possible and may be indispensable.  The search ambit cannot be said to have been misstated in any material way by being expressed in narrower terms by date than it had to be, leaving any wider material found to be potentially seized by the exercise of the power bestowed by s 3F(1)(d)(i).  For the same reason, the area of search defined by the search warrants cannot be said to be any broader than was justified by the supporting affidavit material.120    In Dunesky v Elder, the Full Court relevantly considered on appeal a challenge to the validity of search warrants on the basis that certain particulars in the offence descriptions did not identify an offence known to law.  In that case, the offence stated in the search warrants was defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act.  The complaint was that the particulars for the offence, referring to a failure to disclose “assessable income”, were inconsistent with s 161(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth).  In that regard, it was submitted by the unsuccessful appellant that s 161(1) was directed to an obligation to report “total income”, encompassing capital gains or profits, which are not embraced within the ordinary understanding of the word “income”.  On that basis, it was said that the warrants failed to disclose a relevant alleged offence.  The Full Court did not accept the appellant’s argument, considering that the expression “assessable income” means simply all of the income received which may be assessable income under the legislation.  The Full Court further considered, at 558A, that the particularisation of the offence by reference to the omission of “assessable” income was not only not misleading, but “actually assists the reader of the warrants to understand better the nature of the offence alleged than if the matter had rested with a general statement of the offence in the language of s 29D”.  In a similar way, focusing on a portion of a suspected offending period may well assist by making the directly authorised ambit of search narrower or more comprehensible.  That is to say that the inclusion of an approximate date or limited date range, while perhaps not being precise to the standard of an indictment, may be more helpful than not doing so in a search warrant.121    It follows that the search warrant offence descriptions were not beyond the scope of the affidavit by which each warrant was obtained, and there was no fatal departure from the information that was before the issuing officer.122    It should be added that the criticisms made by the primary judge of the drafting of the search warrants were well observed and soundly reasoned.  However, as his Honour concluded, the search warrants were sufficient for the statutory purpose of confining the object of the search that was authorised and provided sufficient guidance as to what was and was not permitted to be seized.  123    There was no error demonstrated in the conclusion reached by the primary judge.  Both of these grounds of appeal should therefore fail.Whether parts of the warrant found to be invalid should have been severed (ground 3)Third appeal ground as pleaded124    Mr Caratti’s third ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour should have found that neither of the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrant was severable and should not have found that, even if it were found that the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was defective, it does not necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole would be declared invalid: [154].Findings of the primary judge relevant to the third appeal ground125    The primary judge observed that, if contrary to his Honour’s conclusion that the statement of the third suspected offence was sufficient to define the search perimeter of the warrants, it would have been necessary to consider whether that part of the warrants could appropriately be severed.  At [154], his Honour declined to express a concluded view, stating:Given the conclusion that has been reached, it is unnecessary to decide whether it would have been appropriate to sever this description of the Whitby Land Company offence from the warrants.  There is, however, much to be said for the proposition that an invalid statement of one offence in the third condition of the warrants could appropriately be severed without doing violence to the balance of the warrants.  Thus, even if it had been found that the statement of the Whitby Land Company offence was deficient, it would not necessarily follow that the warrants as a whole would be declared invalid.Appellant’s submissions on the third appeal ground126    Mr Caratti contended that, upon there being a finding that an offence in the third condition of the warrants is invalid, the whole of the warrant should be declared invalid, having regard to the integral role the third condition plays in specifying the kinds of evidential material to be searched for under the warrants and the extent of the searches and seizures that were carried out.Respondent’s submissions on the third appeal ground127    The Commissioner submitted that the primary judge was correct to consider that, had the warrants been invalid in respect of their statement of the third offence, that defect might be validly severed from the warrant.  It was submitted that it is irrelevant to the issue of severability that the searches and seizures were extensive and that documents were seized in relation to each company.  Whether a part of a warrant is severable was said to depend on the meaning of the warrant and the objective intention of the issuing officer, not the manner in which the warrant is executed.  Thus to assert that the third offence was “integral” to the warrants is to assume the answer to the relevant inquiry.  Consideration of the third appeal ground128    As no further finding of invalidity has been found, there is no issue of severance.  However, in the event that the conclusions reached about any of the offence descriptions are wrong, that invalidity could and would have been met by severance.  That was an aspect of the outcome reached by the Full Court in Parker v Churchill at 336.4 and 352.3, in which part of a second-listed offence and all of a fourth-listed offence were found to be invalid, but the balance of the search warrants were held to be valid, giving effective severance.  129    Although there was some overlap in the offences in this case, especially between the first and second offences, each was capable of operating and taking effect separately.  There was not the sort of cross-contamination found to be present in Coco at 443-4.  130    It follows that there was no error in the conclusion reached by the primary judge.  This ground of appeal must therefore also fail.Whether the execution of the warrants was invalid (ground 4; part of ground 2 below)Fourth appeal ground as pleaded131    Mr Caratti’s fourth ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in finding that the Warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms ([485]).  His Honour should have made the following findings, and held that these matters, by themselves or in combination, were such that the Warrants as a whole were lawfully executed in accordance with their terms.(i)    Given the “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” in the charges, and given the confusion of some officers, his Honour (contrary to [307]-[310]) should have inferred that a sufficient number of officers had a similarly imperfect understanding of the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrants, such that the execution of the Warrants was invalid.(ii)    His Honour should have held (contrary to [326]-[334]) that Mr Irvin of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) was not aware of the content of the Warrants yet had extensive involvement in giving advice to executing officers, advice given by him to executing officers was based not on the offences in the Third Condition of the Warrants but rather on his background knowledge of the ATO audits and the ATO referral to the AFP and there was a “material disjunct” between Mr Irvin's background knowledge of the ATO audit and the ATO referral to the AFP, on the one hand, and, on the other, the offences in the Warrants.(iii)    His Honour should have held (contrary to [335]-[346]) that the ""Search Relevances"" document, which was created by Mr Irvin, was created without regard to the Warrants, there was a material disjunct between the Search Relevances document and the offences in the Warrants, the Search Relevances document was widely distributed to executing officers and, taking into account the “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” in the charges, it should be inferred that the use of the Search Relevances document was such that the Warrants were invalidly executed.Findings of the primary judge on the fourth appeal ground132    In considering Mr Caratti’s challenges at first instance to the execution of the search warrants, the primary judge recorded some general impressions and findings concerning the evidence of the execution of the warrants as a whole.  It is convenient to reproduce those findings below:283    The execution of the search warrants was an extremely large and complex logistical and operational exercise.  The execution of the warrant at the Wickham Street premises occurred over three days.  It involved upwards of 70 AFP and tax officers.  The Duncraig Road warrant involved more than 20 officers.  The execution of the Irvin Street, Cornish Turn and Harrisdale warrants were smaller exercises, but even so they involved a relatively large number of officers:  eight in the case of the Irvin Street premises; fifteen in the case of the Cornish Turn premises; and twelve in the case of the Wright Road premises.  Mr Caratti’s contentions concerning certain aspects of the execution of the warrants must be considered in the context of the size and complexity of the overall operation.284    This large and complex operation was overseen by Federal Agent Nicholson.  He delivered the main operational briefing that was the subject of one of Mr Caratti’s complaints.  Federal Agent Nicholson was an impressive and credible witness.  There is no reason whatsoever to doubt that Federal Agent Nicholson genuinely intended to ensure that all warrants were executed fairly and in accordance with their terms and the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act.  There is also no reason whatsoever to doubt the he did what he considered was necessary and desirable to ensure, as best he could, that the warrants were properly and reasonably executed. 285    One of the operational difficulties faced by Federal Agent Nicholson was that, given the size and complexity of the operation, it was necessary for him to engage the services of a large number of Federal Agents who had not had any, or any significant, prior involvement in Operation Caballus or the investigation into the offences allegedly committed by Mr Caratti and Ms Bazzo.  That difficulty was compounded by at least two other matters. 286    First, the investigation and the warrants concerned matters of considerable factual and legal complexity.  In short terms, the offences to which the warrants related involved allegations concerning the income tax and GST affairs of several companies over a number of years.  It might reasonably be inferred that a number of the Federal Agents involved in the execution of the warrants were not particularly well-versed in the fine detail of the tax legislation that underlay the various alleged offences.287    Second, as has already been pointed out at length, the search warrants were drafted in terms that did not make the task faced by the officers who were to execute the warrants any easier.  For the reasons already given, the warrants were validly issued and complied with the requirements of the Crimes Act.  They were, however, in a number of respects poorly drafted and difficult to understand.  In practical terms, it was always going to be difficult for Federal Agents who had no previous involvement in the relevant investigation, or who had no significant knowledge or experience in tax related matters, to make the required search and seizure decisions without some assistance.288    Federal Agent Nicholson sought to deal with those operational difficulties in two ways.  First, he distributed a detailed tactical plan and conducted a briefing in relation to the execution of the warrants.  Second, he arranged to have a large number of tax officers, including some with direct knowledge and involvement in the tax affairs of Mr Caratti and companies associated with him, to assist in the execution of the warrants. 133    Mr Caratti’s challenges to the execution of the search warrants at trial were dealt with by the primary judge in five key parts.  134    First, it was contended that the briefing conducted by Federal Agent Nicholson was insufficient to ensure that the relevant officers had a proper understanding of the warrants, and that, in any event, not all of the executing officers attended the briefing, or received the tactical plan, and no record was kept of the attendees.  The primary judge rejected these contentions, considering that the evidence demonstrated that the briefing was adequate in all the circumstances, or at least was not inadequate.  His Honour took care to stress that while the briefings may have been important having regard to the complexity of the warrants, the primary focus of the inquiry into the reasonableness of the execution of the warrants should be the decisions made and actions taken.  It would only be if deficiencies of the briefing fed through into the actual execution of the warrants that the briefings would be of any particular significance. 135    Secondly, Mr Caratti contended that the evidence revealed that the Federal Agents who were involved in executing the warrants misunderstood and had inconsistent understandings of the terms of the warrants, particularly in relation to the third condition.  This was said to be demonstrated, for example, by evidence that suggested discrepancies in the understandings of certain Federal Agents as to whether references in the first, second and third offences to 2008 referred to the 2008 income year or calendar year.  In rejecting this contention, the primary judge found that it could not be inferred that all or even a majority of the 50 Federal Agents involved had an imperfect or incomplete understanding of the offences.  Furthermore, it could not be concluded that an imperfect understanding or appreciation of the dates would necessarily lead to seizure of documents not properly seizable under the warrants, nor could it be said that any confusion as to dates meant that the search and seizure was effectively “unlimited as to time”. 136    Thirdly, Mr Caratti made a number of distinct contentions about the involvement of tax officers in the execution of the warrants.  Perhaps most significantly, it was said that the Federal Agents had improperly deferred to advice given by tax officers in the course of executing the warrants.  This submission was rejected by the primary judge on the basis that it could not be concluded that the executing officers simply followed the directions of the tax officers and did not turn their minds to whether a document properly satisfied the conditions in the warrant.  Moreover, his Honour considered that it was both permissible and reasonable for Federal Agent Nicholson to request the assistance of tax officers in executing warrants, noting the rhetorical comment of Lockhart J in Dunesky v Commonwealth at 502:  “Who better to assist in the identification of relevant documents … than the tax officers who are intimately conversant with the subject matter of their audits?”137    Fourthly, Mr Caratti contended that advice given by tax officers during the execution of the warrants concerning the seizure of documents was based on a “misguided” understanding of the offences to which the warrants related.  Having regard to a lack of evidential foundation for the appellant’s challenges, his Honour rejected the contention that certain tax officers – Mr Irvin, Mr Crawshaw, and Ms Milner – were variously not aware of the warrants, did not base their advice on the warrant conditions and conflated or confused the audit and referral information with the warrant offences.138    Fifthly, Mr Caratti contended that the distribution of a “Search Relevances” document – prepared by Mr Irvin to provide more detail concerning the allegations that were the basis of the offences – meant that the warrants were unreasonably or excessively executed.  Notwithstanding some concern about the inherent risk that such a document will be given undue prominence and perhaps even become a surrogate for the warrant itself, the primary judge rejected the appellant’s contention.  His Honour did not accept that the document was given any undue prominence, nor could any direct causal connection be established between the use of the document and the seizure of any item.  Appellant’s submissions on the fourth appeal ground139    Mr Caratti challenged the primary judge’s conclusions in three key respects.  140    First, it was said that the primary judge should have held that the patent “ambiguity” and “lack of clarity” of the offences in the third condition meant that a significant number of the 50 officers involved in executing the warrants had an imperfect or incomplete understanding of the nature of the offences, resulting in improper seizures.  Again, such was said to be demonstrated by evidence that Federal Agent van Tooren and Federal Agent Szolnoki had differing understandings as to whether the reference to “2008” in the offences referred to an income year or calendar year.  It was submitted further that, contrary to the findings of the primary judge, an inference should be drawn that a sufficient number of the executing officers had an imperfect understanding of the offences, and that it should not be incumbent on the appellant to call every officer to give evidence of their understanding.  141    Secondly, it was contended that, contrary to the primary judge’s conclusion, execution of the search warrants miscarried by reason of advice given by Mr Irvin in the course of the process.  Mr Caratti submitted that Mr Irvin had not read or even seen the warrants prior to execution, and that his advice to officers was based on his background knowledge of the ATO audit and referral, giving rise to a “material disjunct” between his understanding of the offences and the terms of the warrants themselves.  This disjunct is said to have infected the execution of the warrants by reason of Mr Irvin’s authority and ostensible influence over the process.  142    Finally, it was contended that inclusion of Mr Irvin’s Search Relevances document in packs distributed to some of those involved in the execution of the warrants resulted in the warrants being unreasonably or excessively executed.  The Search Relevances document, prepared by Mr Irvin without having read the warrants, is said to disclose on its face a similar disjunct between his understanding of the offences and the terms of the warrants themselves.  By way of illustration, it was pointed out that the document confusingly named persons and entities that were not included in the second condition of the warrants, which Mr Irvin suggested in cross-examination was for the purpose of giving examples of what was excluded from the search.  Further, it was said that those executing the warrants could also easily have misinterpreted a dot point in item 4 of the document stating “Gucce failed to report all sales on BAS – NON-COMPLIANT”, which was conceded to be unclear by Mr Irvin in cross-examination before the primary judge.  Respondent’s submissions on the fourth appeal ground143    The Commissioner’s position was that Mr Caratti has failed to discharge the onus of showing that the warrants were not executed in accordance with their terms, relying on Williams v Keelty at [235] (to which should be added a reference to [236]).  It was said that the matters relied on by Mr Caratti do not individually or cumulatively suggest that any item was seized unlawfully, let alone render open a finding that the warrants as a whole were not executed lawfully.  The Commissioner stressed that “practical considerations” must be borne in mind, citing Baker v Campbell at 83.  It was submitted that there was no error in the primary judge’s conclusion that the executing officers did not rely on the Search Relevances document when conducting the search, and that his Honour’s finding was reached with the benefit of extensive oral evidence and cross-examination of a number of those officers.  144    It was further said that Mr Caratti’s challenges under this ground of appeal fail to address the process which the AFP put in place to facilitate the proper, fair, and careful execution of the warrants.  This process included multiple briefings at various stages of the operation, distribution of hard copies of the warrant conditions to all involved in execution, and the assistance of a number of ATO officers in evaluating the relevance of documents.  145    The Commissioner also submitted that the contention that Mr Irvin did not read the warrants is not established by the transcript references relied on, and the fact that Mr Irvin did not see the warrant prior to execution does not mean that he did not see it during execution.  Moreover, it was submitted that there was sufficient evidence to infer that Mr Irvin had an understanding of the warrant conditions, having been present at the general briefing, the field briefing, and likely having been provided with a copy of the warrant during execution.Consideration of the fourth appeal ground146    Mr Caratti faces a substantial hurdle, both legal and factual, in advancing this appeal ground.  The legal hurdle is that, as already discussed, the primary judge’s conclusions as to the clarity of the search warrant offence provisions being sufficient for their purpose reached should be upheld on appeal.  The factual hurdle is the difficult task of demonstrating that the factual findings and conclusions reached by reference to evidence, including oral evidence, were not open to the primary judge, as opposed merely to being less preferable in some way to those that Mr Caratti asserts should have been made.  147    The conclusions reached by the primary judge turned not just on the documentary and affidavit evidence before his Honour, but also on cross-examination.  His Honour’s conclusions, many of a value judgment or inferential nature, were interwoven with character and credit findings which this Court is in no position to gainsay on appeal.  That is especially so when no attempt was made to take the Court, orally or in writing, to any specific conclusions to point, with precision, to error.  In those circumstances, error has not been demonstrated.  It is therefore appropriate to proceed upon the basis that the factual findings by his Honour are correct, in the sense of being open or available to be made.148    In particular, the primary judge concluded that the ATO officers, while doubtless a source of valuable guidance and advice, did not ultimately dictate what would or would not be seized.  His Honour illustrated this by reference to ATO views being overruled when they entailed a departure from consideration and comparison with the terms of the relevant search warrant.  149    Given that no attempt was made to demonstrate error by reference to any physical item seized, admittedly a difficult path to impugning the whole process, the findings of the primary judge must be viewed as compelling.  No proper basis has been demonstrated for departing from them, let alone for concluding that they entail error.  Conclusion on the fourth appeal ground150    The challenge to the findings of the primary judge as to the execution of the search warrants must also fail.Whether the electronic material found to have been unlawfully seized should have been ordered to be returned (ground 5)Fifth appeal ground as pleaded151    Mr Caratti’s fifth ground of appeal is stated as follows:His Honour erred in:(i)    finding that there is no reason in principle why the permitted use and retention of unlawfully seized material should be on different and narrower terms than that which the statutory regime envisages: reasons for decision of 23 November 2016 at [9];(ii)    describing as neither “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”, an inadequate understanding of the circumstances in which an electronic storage device can be seized on execution of a warrant under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): [471];(iii)    failing to find that it would undermine the statutory regime to now permit the First Respondent to “do what they should have done, or considered doing”, but didn't do, or consider doing, at the time mandated by statute: [474], [478];(iv)    failing to find that the unlawfully seized material should be returned or in the alternative failing to find that it should not be used other than for the purpose of obtaining advice in respect of, investigation and prosecution of any of the “offence[s] to which the warrants relate” within the meaning of that term in s.3E(5)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914: [475], [487] and reasons for decision on 23November 2016 at [9]-[11].Findings of the primary judge relevant to the fifth appeal ground152    The primary judge concluded that a number of items of electronic equipment had been unlawfully seized.  Generally, those findings reflected a failure by the AFP to copy the data or files contained on the equipment at the premises, or to consider whether that course of action was impracticable, instead of seizing the equipment itself without first taking those steps.  As a matter of the Court’s discretion, however, his Honour made orders permitting the Commissioner to inspect the items seized and, if satisfied in terms of s 3 (1A) of the Crimes Act, copy the data in the manner permitted by s 3L(1A)(a).  In adopting this approach, his Honour rejected a submission made by Mr Caratti that the Court’s discretion not to order the return of unlawfully seized items was, as a matter apparently of implicit principle, confined to the circumstances where criminal proceedings were already on foot or it had been shown that the items seized might afford relevant evidence of the commission of the alleged offence.  No proper basis for that principle was evident upon his Honour’s examination of the decisions in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393, Cassaniti v Croucher (1997) 37 ATR 269 and Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] QSC 46; [2002] 2 Qd R 667.  Similarly, his Honour considered that the decision of CC v Rayney [2012] WASC 56; 42 WAR 498, relied on by Mr Carrati, did not provide any assistance to his case.153    The relevant question, the primary judge held, was whether the desirability of allowing the police to retain the illegally seized items outweighed the undesirability of permitting the police to retain the items, having regard to the way in which they were obtained.  In this regard, his Honour did not consider that the circumstances of the seizures were “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”, but rather the product of an inadequate understanding, or perhaps misunderstanding, of the circumstances in which an electronic storage device can be seized.  Taking into account the potential relevance the material might have to the decision to institute criminal proceedings, his Honour was prepared to allow the Commissioner to copy or take an image of the relevant data or files on the unlawfully seized devices.  This, it was said, would be to permit the AFP to do what they should have done in the first place. Appellant’s submissions on the fifth appeal ground154    Two key errors were asserted in the primary judge’s findings.  First, it was said that the primary judge mischaracterised the breaches of the Crimes Act in describing the seizures as neither “deliberate, contumelious or even reckless”.  It was submitted that the primary judge should have held that the lack of appreciation or ignorance of the terms of s 3L of the Crimes Act on the part of the seizing officers amounted at least to reckless disregard for the relevant provisions.  The appellant suggested that key figures in the execution of the warrants, including Federal Agents Nicolson and Jirasinha, were of the belief that if an electronic device was thought to contain evidential material, the device itself could be seized without further consideration.  In light of such a fundamental misunderstanding infecting the process from the top down, it was said that his Honour’s discretion had miscarried.155    Secondly, the appellant submitted that his Honour committed an error of principle in exercising the discretion to permit the further interrogation of the unlawfully seized electronic material.  Relevantly, it was submitted that the outer boundaries of possible purposes for which unlawfully seized electronic equipment might be used are set by the common law, not by the Crimes Act.  Respondent’s submissions on the fifth appeal ground156    The submissions for the Commissioner were to the effect that it was open to the primary judge to reach the conclusions that his Honour did, including upon the basis that recklessness requires more than an inadequate understanding of the law.  It was suggested that there would at least need to be a finding of an awareness of the possibility that that the conduct was unlawful, a proposition that was never put to the witnesses concerned, and a finding that the primary judge did not make.  In the absence of any evidence that the officers concerned did not turn their minds to the terms of the relevant search warrant, there was no basis for finding error.  157    On the issue of discretion, the Commissioner submitted that it was open to his Honour to make orders judicially and by reference to the law, which included the provisions of the Crimes Act.Consideration of the fifth appeal ground158    Once the determination was made that the computer hardware had been unlawfully seized, it was a matter of discretion as to whether the return of those items should be ordered.  The principles in that regard were set out by Hill J in Puglisi at 403-405.  Those principles do not need to be spelt out or repeated.  The primary judge plainly exercised his Honour’s discretion by reference to those principles, applying a careful and reasoned process.  It is worth noting in that regard that in Puglisi, all of the material seized had been obtained by way of a wholly invalid search warrant.  In an attempt to remedy that problem, a fresh search warrant was obtained, to be relied on as a basis to reseize the material immediately upon its return.  The process of return, however, was not completed, such that no valid seizure could take place.  As a consequence, the ongoing retention of the material continued to rely upon the prior invalid seizure.  In considering those circumstances, Hill J nonetheless declined to order that the seized material be returned.  His Honour regarded that use of the material was a matter best left to the criminal courts in the exercise of discretion as to the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence.  The outcome arrived at by the primary judge in this case was more nuanced than in Puglisi, dealing, as his Honour was, with electronic evidence and not just physical documents.159    Once it is appreciated that it was open to the primary judge, in the exercise of the discretion discussed in Puglisi, not to make any order to return any of the illegally seized items, much of Mr Caratti’s case falls away.  That is especially so when issue is taken with orders which were, at least technically, more narrow than was open to his Honour to make.  In particular, his Honour arrived at a solution that mirrored the legislative scheme by allowing the data on the illegally seized electronic equipment to be copied before requiring the physical items to be returned.  The copied data could then be examined and then either seized or destroyed.  This reflected what should have happened in the first place.160    The characterisation of the approach of the primary judge as improperly applying the provisions of s 3L(1A) of the Crimes Act is therefore misconceived.  It is clear that his Honour did not purport to permit the powers under s 3L(1A) to be exercised by the Commissioner per se.  Rather, his Honour’s approach was to make discretionary orders in terms guided by that provision.  That course was plainly available to his Honour, given the wide powers to tailor such relief to the circumstances at hand.  161    Mr Caratti’s case also depends on challenging the primary judge’s exercise of discretion upon the basis that a different outcome should have been reached, without meeting the necessary hurdle of showing that the conclusion arrived at, even if not preferable, was not open to his Honour.  Faced with what might have been a binary choice between permitting unqualified retention and ordering unqualified return, his Honour was doing no more than using the legislative provisions as a guide to a compromise position in the discretionary exercise of wide remedial powers.  In that way, the legislative intent, which permitted examination of data prior to any formal seizure, could ultimately be achieved, albeit not in the manner or timeframe envisaged.  162    This was not a case of ignoring the constraints in the legislative regime, but rather of using it as a principled and rational guide to the exercise of discretion.  The alternative was either to revert to the binary choice or to make orders without guidance.  If forced to the binary choice, the appropriate stance on the part of the primary judge may have been to allow for retention, and to leave the question of what use may be permitted in the event of prosecution taking place to be determined by a court exercising federal criminal jurisdiction, as happened in Puglisi.  In any event, on the authority of Puglisi, the correctness of which has not been questioned, that was a course available to his Honour.  The alternative course taken cannot be said to be one that was not available.163    The fifth ground of appeal is therefore without merit and should be dismissed.Comment on the Commissioner of the AFP obtaining proper legal advice164    Search warrants are a highly invasive process by which fundamental rights are encroached upon.  However, they continue to be a vital part of effective criminal investigation and prosecution.  That is unlikely to change.  To the contrary, the relevance of search warrants may even increase, as the vast array of material and information stored digitally continues to expand.  Appropriate balancing of the competing considerations is best achieved by careful attention to the quality of the process, especially in complex “white collar” cases.165    The primary judge made the following observations about the inadequacies in the search warrants, criticising the quality of the process in this case, and noting what had been done in the past to avoid this occurring:242    There appears to be an unfortunate tendency, in the drafting of three condition warrants, to draft the first condition in such broad terms that it provides no effective filter or guide to the search.  The warrants in this case are a good example of this tendency.  Often the first condition contains an extensive and broadly drafted list of just about every type of document or electronic device that could possibly exist.  When it comes to executing a warrant drafted in such terms, there would be little point in executing officers having regard to the first condition when making search and seizure decisions.  That is because, whatever item is located, it will almost inevitably fall within the extensive list in the first condition.  243    Equally, there is a tendency to draft the second condition so as to include the longest possible list of persons, entities, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and bank accounts that it is possible to compile.  “Things” will meet the condition if they “relate to” any one or more of the persons or entities or address included in that long list.  As already indicated, the expression “relate to” in this context is not only extremely wide, but also potentially vague and indefinite:  Williams v Keelty at 211-212 [158].  It follows that often the second condition is also not a particularly effective filter or guide to what may constitute evidential material.  In most cases, just about everything located at the subject premises is likely to relate to one or more of the persons, entities or other things listed in the second condition. 244    What that means is that frequently the third condition of the warrant is the only effective filter in the warrant.  That may not be a problem in circumstances were the third condition is drafted with care and the greatest degree of precision and particularity that is possible at the stage that the investigation may be at.  In the past, the AFP frequently sought the advice and assistance of experienced lawyers and prosecutors at the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the drafting of search warrants in complex matters.  Regrettably that no longer seems to be the case.  It does not appear to have happened in this case.  If it had, many of the issues that have arisen in relation to the issue and form of the warrants in question would probably not have arisen.245    If appropriate care is not taken in the drafting of the third condition in a warrant, one likely result is a challenge to the warrant, similar to the challenge that has occurred in this case.  While the warrants in question in this case have been found to be valid (other than the one severed paragraph), for the reasons already given, the third condition offences were very poorly drafted.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the drafting of the warrants were by no means frivolous or entirely baseless.246    Throughout the proceedings the Commissioner maintained a stoic and somewhat blinkered position that there was no problem with the drafting of the third condition in the warrants.  Mr Caratti’s complaints concerning the third condition were met by the constant refrain that the statement of the offence in a warrant need not meet a “high bar”.  The Commissioner’s suggestion that there was no problem with the drafting of the warrants was unrealistic, if not fanciful.  While a warrant must be approached in a practical and common sense way, and not with overzealous technicality, that does not mean, as the Commissioner effectively suggested, that s 3E created only a “low bar”.247    Poorly drafted three condition warrants serve only to invite controversy and judicial review challenges.  As these proceedings show, such challenges can end up being long, complex and drawn out affairs.  They result in an unfortunate fragmentation and delay of criminal investigations. 248    The second likely result of poorly drafted warrants is that the execution of the warrants is almost invariably rendered more difficult.  To determine if an item is able to be seized, executing officers are required to consider and comprehend the offences listed in the third condition of the warrant.  As executing officers and constables assisting are unlikely to be legally trained, that may not always be an easy task, particularly where the offences relate to complex commercial or tax-related affairs.  The task is rendered even more difficult where, as is often the case, the executing officers and persons assisting have not had any or any extensive involvement in the relevant investigation.  The task is rendered more difficult still where the third condition offences are not drafted with appropriate care, precision and particularity.  249    There was some evidence that suggested that some of the officers involved in the execution of the warrants may have had an imperfect appreciation of the meaning and scope of the search warrants.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Federal Agents who had not been involved in the investigation appeared to have sought the assistance of tax officers and, in some instances, appeared to use extrinsic aids to assist them to make appropriate search and seizure decisions.  …  The evidence of what occurred during the execution of the warrants is not relevant or admissible in relation to Mr Caratti’s challenge to the validity of the warrants:  Williams v Keelty at 211 [157].  Nevertheless, the evidence concerning the execution of the warrants in issue in this matter serves to illustrate the difficulties and complexities that may arise where warrants concerning complex investigations are not drafted with sufficient care and precision. 166    Those sentiments should be endorsed and enlarged upon.  167    The consequences of the approach taken to the drafting of the search warrants were made clear by this case.  In addition to raising questions of validity of the search warrants, the lack of clarity in the drafting gave rise to further risks in the execution of those warrants.  As was noted by the primary judge, the lead investigator is to be acknowledged for the practical steps he took to ameliorate those difficulties.  That remedial approach might well have failed, especially if the drafting had crossed the line from being merely poor to legally insufficient. 168    It should be observed also that the last two appeal grounds turned on the primary judge’s remedial approach to the problems created by way of severance and by way of orders to facilitate steps being taken that should have taken place at the time of execution of the search warrants.  That, again, was only necessary because of the deficiencies in the drafting.  169    It follows that, in one way or another, the drafting of the search warrants was the direct, or substantial indirect, source of all of the issues and problems in this case.  This was an ultimately expensive and time-consuming way to conduct an investigation.  The time that might have been saved by inadequate drafting has been lost many times over.  170    The consequence of an overall investigative approach to risk management characterised by insufficient resourcing and attention to the importance of rudimentary search warrant drafting was not just the commencement of this litigation, but also the protracted delay in resolving the many difficult issues confronted by the primary judge and by this Court on appeal.  Such delay in carrying out and concluding a criminal investigation is highly undesirable for all concerned.  171    When proper regard is had to the importance of the efficient, effective and fair obtaining and execution of search warrants, and the delay, fragmentation of the criminal investigation process, cost, time of the parties and the use of scarce court time when challenged, the obtaining of proper independent legal advice by a criminal law expert would seem to be a wise investment for the Commissioner.  Taking that step has the prospect of an uncommonly high return on outlay.  In complex fraud investigations in particular, or in like investigations concerning other forms of alleged higher level “white collar” offending, careful independent consideration and legal advice as to the terms of the search warrants sought to be obtained, and perhaps as to the content of the affidavit by which they are sought, including the alignment between the two, would improve the process for all concerned, most particularly at the point of execution of any search warrant that is issued.  The time and cost would pale into insignificance when regard is had to the history of these proceedings.172    In particular, as has happened in the past, obtaining advice from experienced solicitors with the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, perhaps supplemented by the private Bar, may save everyone concerned considerable trouble and expense.  This is an area in which practical criminal law experience is of greatest assistance.  At the very least, that would help to ensure that judicial review challenges are able to be focussed on matters of substance, rather than form, and are thereby able to be heard and determined, either way, much more quickly.Conclusion overall173    As all of the grounds of appeal should fail, the appeal should be dismissed.I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy-three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Logan, Rangiah and Bromwich.Associate: Dated:    10 November 2017",2017-11-10 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: In this matter I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Hall J, which relieves me of the need to refer to the factual and legal background to this application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 I agree with His Honour’s proposed orders and, subject to the following qualifications, his Honour’s reasons. The matters I would wish to address, are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) the approach to be taken to the “aggravating factors” identified in s 21A(2) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 (NSW) (“the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
      ”); 
       
       
      (b) the assessment of prospects of rehabilitation, and 
       
       
      (c) criticisms of the opinions expressed by a clinical psychologist, and 
       
       
      (d) licence disqualification. 
       
       
      Aggravating circumstances 
       
      
    3 The form and structure of s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act was discussed by this Court in a number of cases including R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[58], and R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [18] and [24]-[30] (Howie J) and [38]-[40] (Spigelman CJ). As has been noted, s 21A(1) is expressed in terms which do not seek to constrain reference to those matters which are required or permitted to be taken into account otherwise than under that provision: see also s 21A(4). On the other hand, care must be taken now to comply with the express requirements of s 21A (and other relevant statutory provisions) whether or not similar requirements existed under the general law. 
     
      
    4 Terms such as “aggravating factors” and “mitigating factors”, have a long history of use in this area of the law. Depending on context, usage may vary, but one common intention is to identify those circumstances which may tend to place a particular offence towards the upper or lower ends of a range of moral culpability. That, for example, appears to have been the intended meaning of “aggravating factor” as used in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231. On the other hand, the factors identified in that case could work in either direction: they were in truth ‘relevant considerations’. For example, one factor was the “number of people put at risk”. If that figure were very low, it might be considered a mitigating factor, whereas if it were high, it might be considered an aggravating factor. The relevance of other factors was somewhat ambivalent. Thus, the length of the journey intended to be undertaken by a person under the influence of alcohol is often treated as a relevant consideration, the willingness of an intoxicated person to undertake a lengthy journey being treated as a circumstance of aggravation. On other hand, a very short journey which could have been readily undertaken on foot, may be seen as an aggravating factor because a vehicle was used when such use could easily have been avoided. 
     
      
    5 The clear intention of s 21A was to distinguish aggravating and mitigating factors by identifying them in terminology which was not neutral. Nevertheless, the section does not specify how they are necessarily applied. One approach, commonly adopted in sentencing practice, is to assume that, in terms of culpability of the offender, or potential severity of penalty, particular conduct falls within a high or low range, or otherwise within a mid-range. If that approach is adopted, aggravating factors may be treated as those which support an inference that the conduct involves a level of culpability falling above the mid-range. Mitigating factors have the obverse effect. 
     
      
    6 The one express indication as to the limits of permissible usage, found in sub-s 21A(2), is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      This direction causes difficulty of application in some circumstances, being a difficulty highlighted in the present case. The elements of the offence are to be ascertained by reference to the statutory provisions set out by Hall J at [69] and [70] below. The relevant element of aggravation was that the appellant’s ability to drive was “very substantially impaired” by his consumption of drugs. As Hall J notes, the evidence established such impairment, but was insufficient to establish to the requisite degree anything above and beyond that element of impairment which constituted the circumstance of aggravation. Accordingly, it was submitted, the sentencing judge could not have had regard to “the degree of intoxication” as an aggravating factor: see [98] below; c.f.  
      Regina v Berg  
      [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [25]. 
       
      
    7 Three questions arise in relation to this aspect of the matter. First, “degree of intoxication” is not one of the factors identified in s 21A(2). On the other hand, his Honour regarded it as (with two other factors) demonstrating “an abandonment of responsibility”. That consideration may, at least if it encompasses a degree of conscious or reckless disregard for other road users, fall within paragraph (2)(i), which refers to the offence being committed “without regard for public safety”. This in turn is likely to be a common, if not inevitable, attribute of the aggravated offence, but it is not an element of the offence which needs to be proved. The second question is whether the prohibition should be understood as extending to inherent characteristics of, or characteristics which appertain generally to, an element of the offence. 
     
      
    8 Thirdly, the prohibition contained in the last sentence of sub-s (2) is directed against having “additional regard” to an element of the offence which is an aggravating factor. This prohibition recognises, inevitably, that any element of an offence is a factor to be taken into account; the important question, left unanswered, is how it may legitimately be taken into account. In the present case, the same offence without the circumstance of aggravation is subject to a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The circumstance of aggravation thus lifts the maximum penalty by 4 years, to 11 years, and the mid-point in the scale by 2 years, from three and a half years to five and a half years. That variation may properly be relied upon by a sentencing judge to determine the significance attributed by Parliament to the presence of a circumstance of aggravation, as defined. 
     
      
    9 That legislative assessment may also be assumed to be based upon an assessment of the circumstances which will generally accompany an offence of that kind, including in this example, lack of regard for public safety. In this context, it is helpful to bear in mind that s 21A seeks to identify factors which may arise across the full range of criminal offences. Consistently with that purpose, the factors tend to be identified in general terms. The elements of a specific offence, by contrast, are likely to be defined in more precise terms. Nevertheless, the definition of a particular element may be based upon the policy of avoiding consequences which fall within the general terminology identifying the factors in s 21A(2). 
     
      
    10 To give effect to the underlying purpose of the prohibition, differences in language between the definition of elements of an offence and the statement of aggravating factors, must be borne in mind, as must the purpose underlying the inclusion of a particular element in a particular offence. Such a purposive approach should be applied to the constraint contained in the last sentence of sub-s (2), as a more semantic approach to the language of the various paragraphs may otherwise fail to avoid the risk of “double-counting”, being the result which is clearly intended. As a matter of principle, it follows that characteristics of an element of an offence should also not be treated as aggravating factors if they merely reflect the policy underlying the offence. There can be no doubt that the inclusion of the circumstances of aggravation identified in s 52A(7) of the Crimes Act are intended to prohibit conduct which may well occur in disregard of public safety, because the conscious creation of a drug-affected state, combined with the act of driving a motor vehicle, will usually satisfy that description. Accordingly, acting without regard for public safety should not, in such a case, be given additional effect as an aggravating factor in its own right, unless the circumstances of the case involve some unusually heinous behaviour, or inebriation above the statutory precondition. 
     
      
    11 Because, as noted above, elements of an offence are not irrelevant considerations in identifying an appropriate sentence, it will often be important for sentencing judges to identify with some clarity the way in which they have regard to particular factors. Use of the expression “aggravating factors”, without qualification, is likely to suggest that the matter has been relied upon as falling within the positive mandate of s 21A(2). Nor is the use suggested above the only legitimate use for such considerations. By parity of reasoning, the use of an aggravating factor as defined, which may constitute an element of, or characteristic inherent in or generally appertaining to, a particular offence, may assist in a comparative exercise. For example, it may allow a logical extension to be made from guidelines specified with respect to the ordinary offence, so as to give guidance with respect to sentencing for the aggravated offence. 
     
      
    12 It appears from the cases that the factor which has given rise to significant difficulty is par (i) dealing with offences committed “without regard for public safety”. There has been limited consideration as to whether this factor involves an objective, or subjective test, and if subjective, what level of conscious or reckless disregard is required on the part of the offender. It may well be that this factor should be understood as encompassing both objective and subjective circumstances. However, the distinction can be helpful in order to avoid the danger of double-counting. Where the offence is of a kind which, objectively or abstractly, reflects a policy of prohibiting conduct which disregards public safety, it will be necessary, in order to engage the aggravating factor, to find some aspect of the specific conduct in question which goes beyond the objective element or underlying policy. 
     
      
    13 This approach is consistent with that adopted by this Court in Regina v McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28, particularly at [38] (Howie J, Santow JA and Bell J agreeing). It is also consistent with a frequently quoted passage from R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [172] in which the Court (comprised by Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “What was relevant in this context was his motivation or understanding, so far as that went to an assessment of his moral culpability. He undertook the transaction expecting a considerable personal profit, and in the understanding that the drugs would be resold, heedless of the consequences to those who purchased and consumed them, or of the fact that users commonly resort to property offences to feed a habit, leaving other victims in their wake.” 
        
       
       
      But it should be emphasised that the Court’s finding was that this constituted a relevant aggravating factor, even though the sale was to an undercover operative and the potential adverse consequences for public safety did not eventuate. The distinction between treating an element of the offence as an aggravating factor, having an additional or cumulative effect, and treating specific aspects of the offence and the manner in which it was committed as having such an effect were expressly discussed at [106] and [107]. 
       
      
    14 Subject to one possible qualification, that approach is also consistent with what was said by this Court about aggravating factors in Regina v Ancuta [2005] NSWCCA 275 at [11]-[13] (Brownie AJA, Buddin and Latham JJ agreeing). This case involved a deemed supply of a commercial quantity of heroin. The question raised was whether the sentencing judge was correct in taking into account as aggravating factors the fact that the offence was committed “without the regard for public safety” and that the victims were “vulnerable persons”, matters contained in pars (2)(i) and (l) respectively. There being no victim of the particular offence, the Court understandably held that the primary judge erred in taking par (l) into account: at [13]. In relation to par (i), the Court stated at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It might be said that every supplier or deemed supplier of heroin has failed to have regard for public safety, but it cannot be right to say that everyone convicted of such an offence is to be punished on the basis that there is an aggravating factor, as described in s 21A(2)(i).” 
        
       
      
    15 So much may be accepted, to the extent that failure to have regard for public safety is an inherent characteristic of the offence of deemed supply of heroin and is reflected in the maximum penalty. As a characteristic of all such offences, it should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor with respect to a particular offence. (If, as might be arguable, a deemed supply did not involve conduct “without regard for public safety” at all, the aggravating factor would simply be irrelevant.) However, Brownie AJA continued, by way of obiter dicta, to make a distinction which has the potential to confuse the issue when applied to cases such as the present. At [12] his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant drew a distinction, which I accept as correct, between the supply (or deemed supply) of heroin and offences of a like kind on the one hand, and other offences about which one can properly say that there was a disregard for public safety such as to constitute an aggravating factor – for example, offences relating to the driving of a motor vehicle whilst inebriated, or involving the use of a firearm.” 
        
       
      
    16 In Regina v Aslan [2005] NSWCCA 121, the Court (Grove J, Hunt AJA and Hall J agreeing) were addressing an exercise in sentencing on three counts, being supply of a prohibited drug, selling firearms and supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The judgment noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “[15] As the Crown prosecutor has pointed out, the concept of an offence being committed without regard for public safety is distinguishable from the concept of specifically placing the public at risk. It seems to me it is beyond argument that the supply of a lethal weapon fits the category of aggravation as mentioned in the statute. [Reference was then made to the passage set out above from  
        R v Way 
        .]  
        
       
       
        
        [16] Thus, from that citation, it can be seen that his Honour was correct in taking into account the lack of regard for public safety in relation to all the counts with which he was dealing, the supply of drugs as well as the supply of what I have described as lethal weapons.” 
        
       
       
      With respect, although the danger may not have eventuated in that case, there was a real risk of ‘double-counting’, if concentration were to be placed on par (i) as a relevant aggravating factor, both in relation to the offence of which it appears to have been an element, and in relation to the other offences, unless there were specific aspects of the conduct of the offender which could be relied on as an additional consideration. 
       
      
    17 As discussed above, it is necessary to distinguish cases where a factor identified in sub-s 21A(2) as an aggravating factor is an element of an offence or, in the sense described above, an inherent characteristic or a characteristic that appertains generally to conduct covered by that offence, on the one hand, and other conduct which cannot properly be so described. Driving a motor vehicle whilst inebriated describes a range of conduct and a range of potential offences; in the case of some offences, including the present one, the conduct which includes the circumstance of aggravation in question, might be said to demonstrate an absence of regard for public safety in a more direct and obvious manner than a deemed supply of heroin. In any event it is sufficient to say that the distinction does not operate in the way suggested by Brownie AJA in Ancuta in relation to circumstances of the present case. 
     
      
       
      Prospects of rehabilitation 
       
      
    18 Both general law sentencing principles, picked up by the concluding sentence in s 21A(1), and the express reference in s 21A(3)(g), to the likelihood of re-offending and in (h) to the prospects of rehabilitation, require that the Court give consideration to those prospects. Any view formed by the Court in those regards, will inevitably be speculative to an extent. 
     
      
    19 In assessing prospects of rehabilitation, the Court will generally have access to material falling within one or more of the following categories: 
     
      
       
      (a) evidence of past conduct and behaviour of the offender; 
       
       
      (b) professional opinions, taking into account past conduct and behaviour and expressing views as to future prospects, and 
       
       
      (c) at least in some cases, the opinions and expressions of intention of the offender himself or herself. 
       
      
    20 In the present case, the sentencing judge had before him evidence falling into all three categories, the applicant having himself given evidence at the sentencing hearing. However, for the reasons identified by Hall J, I agree that his Honour’s remarks on sentence demonstrate a failure to give proper weight to the report of Ms Duffy and an apparent reliance on an irrelevant moral judgment about irresponsibility on the part of the applicant, in conceiving a child with his partner: see [86]-[89] below. The latter point, in particular, appears to have affected his Honour’s assessment of the evidence given by the applicant, a matter which would otherwise be properly left to his assessment. Thus, it would not normally be open to this Court to reject conclusions by his Honour that he had no optimism as to the applicant maintaining a drug-free lifestyle, and his conclusion that he was not “genuinely contrite”, but merely expressing “his fear of impending imprisonment”. In this case, those conclusions are attended by a level of doubt flowing from the identified errors. 
     
      
    21 In the circumstances, the best that this Court can do is to read the transcript of the evidence given by the applicant with caution, given the fact that the applicant evidently failed to persuade the sentencing judge in material respects. That being said, the Court may take some comfort from the fact that there is no suggestion that the sentencing judge relied for his assessment on the manner in which the applicant presented in the witness box; rather, it seems likely that his Honour’s scepticism was based upon the objectively established history of past conduct and behaviour. 
     
      
    22 In some cases, in similar circumstances it may be desirable for this Court to remit the matter for further consideration by the primary judge. However, that must be an option of last resort and neither party proposed it. The applicant should, in the present circumstances, obtain the benefit of the doubts. 
     
      
       
      Criticisms of psychologist 
       
      
    23 Before the sentencing judge, the applicant tendered two reports prepared by Ms Anita Duffy, a clinical psychologist. In the first report, Ms Duffy set out in some detail serious problems which the applicant had faced in his early life, including significant violence at the hands of a stepfather who, after the break-up of the relationship with the applicant’s mother murdered his new partner and subsequently committed suicide in goal. Ms Duffy also catalogued his history of substance abuse and his more recent attempts to change his lifestyle. She expressed an optimistic view in relation to his capacity to continue to abstain from drug use. At the conclusion of her second report, of 8 April 2005, she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is thought that especially now given his drug-free status, it would be a retrograde step to introduce him into a goal system, which is apparently rife with drugs and the violence that this often incurs.” 
        
       
      
    24 Apparently in relation to this last statement, the sentencing judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “She also expresses a view about how I should discharge my function as the sentencing judge. I regard that as offensive and I reject her opinions.” 
        
       
       
      As Hall J has held at [87] below, that passage in his Honour’s judgment did not justify the rejection of her opinion out of hand. The Crown did not seek to challenge Ms Duffy’s evidence and, accordingly, it should have been accepted as a bona fide expression of professional opinion. 
       
      
    25 The legitimate purpose of the tender of the report (to which no objection was taken) was to provide a professional assessment of the applicant’s state of psychological health, and a prognosis which will, no doubt, be speculative, but which should properly take into account the circumstances in which the offender is likely to find himself. If, from the point of view of his psychological health, a prison term would be detrimental, in the opinion of the psychologist, there is no legitimate criticism which can be made of her for expressing that opinion. If, for some identifiable reason, an opinion is outside her area of expertise, it is a matter for the prosecution to object to its tender. It is always open to the sentencing judge to reject the opinion and, particularly where he has had an opportunity to assess the offender in the witness box, that may provide a proper basis for so doing. Alternatively, the judge may properly accept the opinion and still impose a sentence of imprisonment, accepting the likely adverse consequences. 
     
      
    26 It would, of course, be entirely inappropriate for any health professional to seek to pass judgment on the conduct, or possible conduct, of a sentencing judge. But to read the sentence quoted above from the psychologist’s report as constituting such a comment is, in my view, unjustified. It is open for a judge who believes that the conduct of a witness is offensive to the Court, to take appropriate steps to restrain such conduct (if that be necessary), but otherwise it will be necessary to take especial care that any personal response is put to one side in carrying out the relevant judicial function. 
     
      
    27 It follows that I agree with Hall J’s view that proper weight was not given to the opinions of Ms Duffy. Even if that conclusion were wrong, the expression of a personal response to the manner in which her report was expressed, whether justified or not, combined with the absence of a reasoned rejection of her conclusions, on legitimate grounds, gives rise to a real apprehension that her evidence has not been properly assessed. 
     
      
       
      Licence disqualification 
       
      
    28 The fact that the sentencing judge had “little confidence” in the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and, to that end, required an extended period of supervision, invites consideration in relation to his entitlement to hold a driver licence, pursuant to the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the 1999 Act”) in force when the applicant was sentenced. That legislation has now been replaced by the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) (“the 2005 Act”). 
     
      
    29 Pursuant to s 25 of the 1999 Act, a person convicted of a “major offence”, a term which included any relevant offence under the Crimes Act 1900, was automatically disqualified from holding a licence for a period of three years: s 25(2)(d): see now s 188(2)(d) of the 2005 Act. However, the Court had power to impose a different period of disqualification, subject to the restriction that if reducing the period, the period might not be shorter than 12 months. The automatic period of disqualification increased to five years in the case of a person with an earlier conviction for a major offence, within the preceding five years: s 25(3)(d) under the 1999 Act, and now s 188(3)(d) under the 2005 Act. 
     
      
    30 In a case such as the present, the law requires that a significant period of imprisonment be imposed. That penalty is intended provide a significant deterrent against future conduct of the same kind. However, it needs to be recognised that inappropriate levels of alcohol consumption and use of other drugs may be related to social, physiological and even genetic causes. Social elements may, to an extent, be exacerbated rather than diminished by a period in custody. The fact that the commission of serious driving offences is taken to warrant a level of automatic licence disqualification indicates that the Parliament has adopted a significant protective measure, in the interests of public safety, where an offender has demonstrated a level of irresponsibility which is incompatible with the statutory privilege of holding a driver licence. However, where a sentencing judge is concerned about the prospects of rehabilitation, it will often be appropriate to give consideration to the adequacy of the automatic period of disqualification. 
     
      
    31 The comment made by the trial judge with respect to the need for an extended period of supervision suggests that there might be benefit in a power which would allow for continued disqualification until an offender had complied with conditions sufficient to satisfy an appropriate authority that he or she was now a person fit to hold a driver licence. There may be some doubt as to whether the statutory provisions noted above allow the imposition of such a conditional period of disqualification. Because no attention was paid to this issue on the appeal, or it would seem at the sentencing hearing, it is not possible to deal further with these considerations. (But see generally comments in relation to the relevance of licence disqualification in Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol [2004] NSWCCA 303 at [110]-[117].) 
     
      
       
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    32 As Hall J notes, applying R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 – see [116] below - the identification of error on the part of the sentencing judge is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for quashing the sentence and passing some other sentence in substitution therefor. To take that step, the Court must be satisfied that some other sentence “is warranted in law”. (Various of the cases in which that principle has been considered are discussed by Johnson J in Douar v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 455 at [80]-[123], in addressing whether it was open to the Court to receive evidence of post-sentence conduct.) 
     
      
    33 Taking into account these various factors, and the additional matters discussed by Hall J, and in particular the views expressed in Regina v McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28, I accept that, subject to one qualification, and prior to any reduction for the plea of guilty, a sentence of between six and seven years imprisonment would have been justified.  
     
      
    34 The qualification flows from the difficulty of knowing what weight should properly have been given to the subjective circumstances of the case. There being material before the Court which was highly supportive of the applicant and which was not given proper weight by the sentencing judge, the proper course is to give that material significant weight, even though that course may be unduly beneficial to the applicant. Nevertheless, against that material must be weighed the history of prior conduct noted by Hall J, including the repeated use of drugs in combination with use of a motor vehicle. In the circumstances, it is appropriate to impose a sentence in the lower half of the proposed range, that is between six years and six and a half years. 
     
      
    35 When such a sentence is reduced by 20%, reflecting the trial judge’s estimate of the utilitarian value of the guilty plea, it will be seen that no significant variation is required to the sentence of five years imposed in the District Court. Had the sentencing judge maintained the statutory relationship between the minimum term and the full sentence period, a non-parole period of three years nine months would have eventuated. 
     
      
    36 Again, despite his concerns as to the prospects of rehabilitation, his Honour found special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and imposed a non-parole period which constituted 50% of the sentence, or, in the statutory terms, specified a balance of the term of the sentence which was 100% of the non-parole period. That result is not easy to reconcile with his Honour’s expressed lack of confidence in the prospects of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, being favourable to the applicant, the conclusion should stand. 
     
      
    37 Because, as demonstrated by Hall J, the applicant established errors in approach on the part of the sentencing judge, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. However, not being satisfied that any lesser sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    38 HOWIE J: I have had the benefit of reading both the judgments of the other members of the Court in draft. I agree with the orders proposed by Hall J for the reasons given by him. I also agree with the judgment of Basten JA and wish to make a very brief comment about the matters referred to by the Presiding Judge. 
     
      
    39 It is unfortunate indeed that those responsible for drafting s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have made the task of sentencing courts more difficult, or at least more prone to error (either real or apparent), by what was in my opinion a needless attempt to define relevant factors into categories of aggravation or mitigation and yet apparently without the intention of altering the common law as it was applied to sentencing before the advent of the section. One has only to look back over sentence appeals determined by this Court over the last two years to see the impact that this section has had upon the work of this Court. And yet, as I pointed out in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145, if sentencing judges simply take into account the relevant sentencing factors that were taken into account before the introduction of the section, they will inevitably comply with the section’s demands. 
     
      
    40 There is now another unnecessary complication fully identified as arising from the introduction of the section that will plague sentencing judges and this Court: not only must the sentencing court not take into account as an aggravating feature an element of the offence, it also must not take into account as an aggravating feature an inherent characteristic of the class of offence of which the offence before the court is an example. Yet this must be so in order to avoid either real or apparent double counting of aggravating features. As Basten JA points out, this matter was referred to in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [172], it was identified in R v McMIllan [2005] NSWCCA 28 at [38] and it was considered in R v Ancuta [2005] NSWCCA 275 at [11]. The fact that there is an apparent inconsistency in approach between the view taken in McMillan and that taken in Ancuta in relation to dangerous driving under the influence of alcohol shows how difficult it is to determine whether it is permissible to take into account the aggravating factor that “the offence was committed without regard for public safety” in any particular case. 
     
      
    41 However, a similar problem arises with other factors of aggravation set out in the section. It has been identified in cases of child sexual assault in relation to the aggravating factor that the victim was vulnerable: see R v JBD [2005] NSWCCA 102 but cf R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116. The vulnerability of the child may or may not be an aggravating factor under the section depending upon the age of the child and the nature of the offence. This is because it is an inherent characteristic of the class of child sexual assault offences that the child is vulnerable. 
     
      
    42 Another example of the same issue arose in relation to armed robbery offences and the aggravating factor that “the injury…..was substantial”: see R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 but cf R v Solomon [2005] NSWCCA 158. Because the court always takes into account in armed robbery offences that the victim will be traumatised, there must be some harm proved that is more severe than that which is usually presumed to arise in the commission of such an offence before the aggravating factor could be applied. It is an inherent characteristic of the offence of armed robbery that the harm to the victim will be substantial. 
     
      
    43 So in relation to offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm or death, it will almost inevitably be the case that it is an inherent characteristic of the class of offence that it is committed without regard for public safety. And this will be so whether the lack of regard is viewed on an objective or subjective basis. Yet the prohibition against taking that aggravating factor into account is not universal because, in a particular case the lack of regard for public safety may be so egregious that it transcends that which would be regarded as an inherent characteristic of the offence. 
     
      
    44 In the present case there was simply no evidence upon which the sentencing judge could find that the lack of regard for public safety that is inherent in the offence of driving while under the influence of a drug was greater than that which would generally apply to that class of offence and, therefore, he was in error in finding that this instance of the offence was aggravated by that factor. 
     
      
    45 It should also be borne in mind that when sentencing for offences of aggravated dangerous driving it will almost inevitably be the case that the offender will have “abandoned responsibility” as that expression is used in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 or will have displayed “high moral culpability” as that expression is used in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. The fact that the aggravating element of the offence is present will generally be sufficient to show that the offender’s culpability has reached at least that degree. There is in my view simply no point in seeking to apply the guideline in Whyte in order to determine that question when the offence is an aggravated one by reason of the elements of the offence charged. There is a real risk that, in trying to apply the guideline judgment to decide that question, the court will double count an aggravating factor in the guideline which is an element of the aggravated offence. The judgment in Whyte recognises that the increased sentence for the aggravated offence will generally reflect the increased moral culpability inherent in the aggravated form of the offence. 
     
      
    46 HALL J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Travis James Elyard in respect of a sentence imposed upon him by the District Court of New South Wales at Campbelltown (his Honour, Judge B. Maguire) on 2 May 2005. 
     
      
    47 On 23 February 2005, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm pursuant to s.52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    48 On 2 May 2005, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months and a balance of term of two years and six months. 
     
      
    49 The application for leave to appeal dated 27 September 2005 and filed on 29 September 2005 is brought pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    50 The applicant relies upon eight grounds of appeal which I will consider later in this judgment. 
     
      
    51 The relevant factual circumstances are as follows. The applicant was born on 19 November 1979 and is presently 26 years of age. On 6 February 2004 at approximately 7.40 pm, he was driving his Mitsubishi van along the Hume Highway at Liverpool. The vehicle proceeded through the intersection of the Hume Highway and Moore Street against a red light at that intersection and collided with a pedestrian, Mrs. Mirka Subotic, who was crossing a marked pedestrian crossing in accordance with a green pedestrian light. Mrs. Subotic suffered significant injuries which required hospitalisation, emergency surgery and treatment which I will refer to in due course. She has been left with ongoing disabilities in consequence of them. 
     
      
    52 The collision occurred on a Friday evening at the above stated time when it is reasonable to assume that there was a considerable volume of traffic using the highway. Prior to the accident, he had driven from his home in Campbelltown to a friend’s house at Mt. Pritchard. The accident occurred on the return trip, after driving for approximately 15 minutes, at the abovementioned time of 7.40 pm. In a statement provided by the applicant dated 18 April 2004, he falsely claimed that he had the green traffic light operating in his favour and inferred that the pedestrian simply stepped in front of his van causing the collision. 
     
      
    53 The evidence before the sentencing judge included a certificate of Judith Perl, a clinical forensic pharmacologist with the New South Wales Police Service, Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit. In her certificate dated 31 March 2004, she records observations of attending police at the accident scene about which there was no controversy. The following description appears:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… when spoken to by Police at the scene it was noted that ELYARD appeared to have slurred speech, he appeared pale, indifferent, relaxed, sedated, unable to follow instructions, he appeared unaware of events occurring around him, he appeared to be sleepy, his eyelids were drooping, his eyes were glazed, his pupils appeared pinpoint, his speech was slurred and slow and his movements were sluggish. He generally appeared to be well affected by some substance. 
        
       
       
        
        He admitted having taken some Valium and Serapax and using some cannabis earlier that day.” 
        
       
      
    54 A blood sample was taken from the applicant at 9.10 pm on the day of the accident. It was found to have present morphine (total) 0.36 milligrams per litre, codeine (total) 0.03 milligrams per litre, diazepam 0.5 milligrams per litre, nordiazepam 0.4 milligrams per litre, oxazepam 0.4 milligrams per litre, temazepam 0.1 milligram per litre, clonazepam 0.01 milligrams per litre, delta-9-THC less than 0.005 milligrams per litre and delta-9-THC acid 0.035 milligrams per litre. His urine sample also indicated the presence of acetylcodeine, monoacetylmorphine, imipramine and methadone. 
     
      
    55 Dr. Perl in her report stated, by way of conclusion:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Based on my specialised knowledge and relying on the above information, I am of the opinion that at the time of driving ELYARD was under the influence of morphine (heroin), diazepam and oxazepam to the extent that his driving ability would have been significantly impaired. In addition, it is possible that methadone may have also been a contributory factor in the impairment.” 
        
       
      
    56 It is apparent from the evidence of Dr. Perl that the abovementioned police observations as to the applicant’s condition following the accident are consistent with the combined effects of central nervous system depressants as detected in the applicant’s blood sample. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence 
       
      
    57 His Honour Judge Maguire accurately recorded the circumstances of the accident as revealed in the statement of facts. He also had regard to:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The significant findings of Dr. Perl. 
       
       
      (b) The physical injuries as including cerebral haemorrhage, multiple lacerations to the spleen, multiple fractures of the ribs and fractures of the left acetabulum and sacral alar. Reference is also made to the fact that the spleen was removed. 
       
       
      (c) The disabilities suffered which included urinary incontinence, the contraction of Hepatitis B (attributed to the transfusion of a bottle of contaminated blood), continuing depression, cognitive impairments and physical limitations. Reference is made to the fact that the victim would have life-long impairments. 
       
       
      The applicant’s record 
       
      
    58 The sentencing judge appropriately had regard to the fact that, at the time of the collision, the applicant was on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for the offence of take and drive conveyance without consent of owner. Additional reference is made to the fact that approximately five weeks before the offence in question, the applicant was observed by police driving in a motor vehicle in the car park of a hotel. Blood and urine analysis disclosed that the applicant had ingested a combination of drugs similar to those detected by Dr. Perl after the subject accident. 
     
      
       
      Subjective factors 
       
      
    59 The sentencing judge extracted into the remarks on sentence a number of paragraphs recorded in the Probation and Parole report dated 13 April 2005 (Exhibit D). In this regard, the report referred to the applicant’s dysfunctional upbringing, which included his subjection to ongoing occasions of violence, verbal intimidation and threats. The report records the fact that the applicant was evicted from the family home at 16 years of age when a largely transient and drug affected lifestyle is said to have commenced. The report also records the relationship between the applicant and his defacto partner that had existed for some three years and the reference by the applicant to the fact of the pending birth of his first child which is described “… as a significant contributor in his attempt to maintain a stable and drug free lifestyle …”. 
     
      
    60 The report also records:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The fact that the applicant completed Year 10 at Terrigal High School when living with his father and engaged in periodic employment due largely to his transient and drug affected lifestyle. There is reference to the applicant’s history of poly-substance abuse and dependence claiming that the applicant commenced cannabis use at 12 years of age, alcohol and amphetamine use by 14 years of age and intravenous amphetamine use from 16 to 21 years of age before the commencement of heroin. 
       
       
      (b) The history of drug treatment programmes (being incompleted programmes). He had undertaken, subsequent to the collision on 6 February 2004, a pharmacotherapy intervention programme at Coopers Cottage, Campbelltown Hospital (commencing 16 April 2004). 
       
       
      (c) The applicant’s expressions of remorse for his actions causing injury to the pedestrian victim. 
       
       
      (d) The opinion that the applicant had made significant effort in addressing some of the maladaptive behaviours that had contributed to his past offending. It concludes with the statement:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “His ability to sustain such change and not relapse in relation to drug use will be an ongoing endeavour.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Evidence rejected by the sentencing judge 
       
      
    61 The sentencing judge stated that whilst he accepted the facts set out in the quoted extracts from the Probation and Parole report, he rejected what he termed the “positive spin” concerning the expectation of the birth of the child and in doing so, in my opinion inappropriately, referred to what he described as the irresponsible conception of the child adding that he inferred from the facts in relation to the mother’s other children “that she is incompetent as a mother”. The sentencing judge then added the sentence “this compounds the offender’s irresponsibility”. 
     
      
    62 Whilst the applicant’s past criminal history and history of poly-substance abuse was relevant to the sentencing task, I consider that his Honour’s reference to the conception of the child and his observations as to the irresponsibility of the applicant and of his partner were irrelevant considerations to the task which he was required to undertake.  
     
      
    63 The second matter to which his Honour took exception were observations by the psychologist, Ms. Anita Duffy, in her report of 16 November 2004. His Honour referred, disapprovingly, to the psychologist’s expressions of opinion as to the need for alternatives to imprisonment being considered and this, the sentencing judge stated, he regarded as “offensive” and rejected her opinions. I have considered whether and to what extent the psychologist entered into questions that were ultimately for the sentencing judge. I am of the opinion that the psychologist did, but, having reflected on the matter, I do not consider that this was improper. A psychologist may legitimately address what he or she considers, from a professional or clinical perspective, is necessary or desirable to enhance an offender’s rehabilitation and for issues related to custodial matters to be raised in relation thereto. Such an opinion will be one amongst other matters that a sentencing judge will have regard to and give it such weight as he or she considers appropriate in the particular circumstances. 
     
      
       
      History of the proceedings – the plea of guilty 
       
      
    64 On 11 June 2004, a Court Attendance Notice was issued. The proceedings were delayed whilst the Director of Public Prosecutions sought a medical report concerning the injuries suffered by Mrs. Subotic. According to the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, throughout this period it was indicated by the defence that the applicant would be pleading guilty in the matter. The Director of Public Prosecutions determined that the matter should be dealt with in the District Court (following receipt of the report from Dr. Hodgkinson dated 6 January 2005). The applicant entered a guilty plea to the charge on 25 February 2005 at the Liverpool Local Court and was committed for sentence that day to the Campbelltown District Court. On this history, the applicant was entitled to the benefit of a discount on sentence for an early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    65 On 11 March 2005, the matter came before the Campbelltown District Court but the matter was unable to proceed as the pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service was unavailable. On 22 April 2005, the matter came before Maguire, DCJ. when evidence was taken at the sentencing hearing. The sentence was, as earlier noted, handed down on 2 May 2005. 
     
      
       
      Periodic detention 
       
      
    66 The applicant was serving two sentences of periodic detention at the time that he was sentenced on 2 May 2005. These related to an offence of driving whilst under the influence of a drug and a re-determination of a suspended sentence which he had received on 28 August 2003 (on that date he was dealt with at the Liverpool Local Court in relation to an offence which occurred on 21 March 2005 of take and drive conveyance without the consent of the owner). He received a 12 month sentence, such sentence being suspended upon him entering bond under s.12, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    67 The driving under the influence matter occurred on 3 January 2004. On that occasion, the applicant was observed by police driving his Mitsubishi van in the car park at the Stardust Hotel at Cabramatta. He was stopped by police and a blood and urine sample was taken. A Court Attendance Notice was posted to the applicant on 25 March 2004 in relation to this matter (that is 19 days after the collision on 6 February 2004). 
     
      
       
      Relevant legal and factual matters 
       
      
    68 Before dealing with the discrete grounds in support of the application for leave to appeal, it is appropriate to identify the relevant legal and factual matters that provide what I consider to be the relevant framework of reference within which those grounds and the sentence imposed may be properly evaluated. 
     
      
       
      (a) The relevant legal factors 
       
      
    69 The provisions of s.52A are prefaced by the subheading: Dangerous driving: substantive matters. Those provisions form part of Part 3 – Offences against the Person, of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 52A(4) is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “s.52A(4)  
        Aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm 
        
       
      
     A person is guilty of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the person commits the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable for imprisonment for 11 years.” 
     
      
    70 Section 52A(7), Circumstances of aggravation, so far as is relevant, provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In this section  
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means any circumstances at the time of the impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm in which:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) … 
        
       
       
        
        (b) … 
        
       
       
        
        (c) ... 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The accused’s ability to drive was very substantially impaired by the fact that the accused was under the influence of a drug (other than intoxicating liquor) or a combination of drugs (whether or not intoxicating liquor was part of that combination).” 
        
       
      
    71 The relevant context and principles by which these provisions were to be applied in the present case included the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The imposition of a sentence with respect to s.52A offences requires the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors specified in s.21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . 
       
       
      (b) In cases such as the present involving the aggravated version of an offence under s.52A of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      :- 
       
       
       (i) an appropriate increment to the  
      Jurisic  
      guideline will be appropriate ( 
      R. v. Jurisic 
       (1998) 45 NSWLR 209); 
       
       
       (ii) in a case involving grievous bodily harm, this will mean that a full-time custodial head sentence of not less than two years is to be adjusted in an upwards direction:  
      R v. Whyte 
       (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, 287; 
       
       
       (iii) an increment is also appropriate in order to reflect the higher maximum penalty for such an offence and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability involved in such an offence; 
       
      
    72 The guideline in Whyte (supra) focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender, of course, also require consideration: per Spigelman, CJ. at 288. 
     
      
       
      (b) The factual context: the objective gravity of the offence 
       
      
    73 In exercising the court’s broad discretion, the sentencing judge was required to focus upon the relevant objective circumstances. In the present case these included:- 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant’s moral culpability for the offence in question against the background of the events in the preceding month (3 January 2004) in which the applicant was driving his van whilst under the influence of prohibited drugs. The fact that at this time he acknowledged that it was serious and against the law to be driving under the influence of drugs, established a very high degree of moral culpability in then proceeding on 6 February 2004 to repeat such conduct by driving whilst under the influence of a combination of prohibited drugs causing serious injury to Mrs. Subotic. 
       
       
      (ii) The conclusion of Dr. Perl that the applicant was  
      “well affected” 
       and was  
      “significant(ly) impaired” 
       by the combination of prohibited drugs on 6 February 2004. 
       
       
      (iii) The extent and nature of the injuries (described in paragraph [57]) which he inflicted upon Mrs. Subotic, which underline the magnitude and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant.  
       
      
    74 The legal and factual matters to which I have referred in paragraphs [68] to [73] guide the evaluation of the grounds relied upon by the applicant in determining whether or not, as is contended, the sentence was manifestly excessive and whether, as is also contended on behalf of the applicant, he should have been ordered to serve his sentence by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    75 The objective circumstances of the offence and those relating to the offender’s conduct clearly place this case in a category of the more serious offences of its kind, though not a worst case. In Jurisic (supra), Spigelman, CJ. referred to the history leading to s.52A and the perceived need for an increase in the maximum penalties for offences such as that involved here. The Chief Justice at p.227 noted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Attorney-General went on to note that the increase in penalties was designed to more accurately reflect the seriousness of the offence with a view to convictions acting as a ‘strong deterrent’ … 
        
       
       
        
        The level of community concern about the conduct proscribed by s.52A, as reflected in this substantial increase in the maximum penalties, must be reflected in the sentences which trial courts impose. The concerns manifested by Parliament in this way, must be given effect to by the courts.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds relied upon 
       
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in not allowing any discount on sentence for the guilty plea 
       
      
    76 The applicant contended that no discount was allowed for the applicant’s guilty plea. Reliance was placed upon the following passage in the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He has, of course, pleaded guilty. That has a utilitarian value which I would reflect in a 20% discount except that the relevant guideline decision  
        R. v. Jurasic 
         (sic) itself must be taken to have allowed such a discount.” 
        
       
      
    77 In this passage, his Honour’s reference was to the guideline judgment in Jurisic (supra) considered in Whyte (supra). 
     
      
    78 In R. v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman, CJ. at 419 observed that the standard case identified in Jurisic included a plea of guilty but that the case was concerned with a guilty plea of limited value:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the guidelines for the offences considered in those cases (referring to  
        R. v. Jurisic  
        and  
        R. v. Henry 
        ) should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty, for purposes of the application of a guideline promulgated in these reasons.” 
        
       
      
    79 Counsel for the applicant who appeared on this application appeared before the sentencing judge on 22 April 2005 and drew his Honour’s attention to the fact that the court in Jurisic was concerned with a plea of limited value. However, in relation to the sentencing judge’s remarks made on 2 May 2005, I accept as correct the submission made by Mr. Watts of counsel on behalf of the applicant that his Honour’s statement incorrectly proceeds upon the basis that the guideline in Jurisic made allowance for an early plea or a plea which would reflect a discount of 20%. This, I believe, is demonstrated by his Honour’s qualifying use of the words “… except that the relevant guideline decision in R. v. Jurasic (sic) itself must be taken to have allowed such a discount”. 
     
      
    80 Error having been disclosed, the question then arises as to whether or not it is an error which requires the intervention of this court. That is an issue to which I will return later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that the applicant “did not apply his brakes until after the victim collided with his windscreen” 
       
      
    81 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant and the Crown raise the question as to whether the evidence does support his Honour’s abovementioned statement. 
     
      
    82 I consider it is unnecessary to examine all of the evidence that bears on this issue for the factual question is tied up with another ground for the application (Ground 7) which was concerned with the contention that his Honour impermissibly had regard to an element of the offence as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    83 In the remarks on sentence, his Honour stated that he had regard to the following four circumstances:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The serious nature of the victim’s injuries and their enduring consequences. 
       
       
      (b) The degree of intoxication which is demonstrated by the fact that the offender did not see the red light and did not apply his brakes until after the victim collided with his windscreen. 
       
       
      (c) He was engaged in a journey which would have kept him on the road for at least 45 minutes and rendered him a potential source of danger to countless other users of the road. 
       
       
      (d) His interception by the police some weeks before these events and the tests carried out upon him must be regarded as a warning, which warning the offender chose to ignore, although the actual results were not available to him at the date of the offence for which he was sentenced. 
       
      
    84 The issue raised in Ground 2 is tied to the question of the degree of intoxication in (b) above. His Honour went on to state:- 
     
      
       
        
        “These factors were present to a material degree and must be regarded as aggravating his crime. The last three mentioned factors are present in such a degree as to demonstrate an abandonment of responsibility. In my view, his then recently detected, albeit not yet punished drug driving offence, amounts to an additional aggravating feature for the purposes of the application of the guidelines laid down in  
        R. v. Jurasic 
         (sic).” 
        
       
      
    85 I will return to consider his Honour’s use of these factors as, in his view, aggravating factors to the crime when considering Ground 7. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in coming to the view that the applicant had poor prospects of rehabilitation 
       
      
    86 The sentencing judge stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I regard this offender as having a poor prospect of rehabilitation. I do not ignore opinions expressed to the contrary by the psychologist. However, it appears to me that the offender has made poor choices about his life since he committed this crime. 
        
       
       
        
        His basing of so much reliance on the advent of his child demonstrates to me a very poor decision in his part. For whatever reason, the mother of this expected child has surrendered the care of her two existing children to others. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender’s prospect of rehabilitation appears to depend upon a ‘lived happily ever after’ dream that he has constructed for himself. I have little confidence in its success.” 
        
       
      
    87 The report of Ms. Duffy dated 8 April 2005 contained an analysis of the history and post-offence conduct by the applicant. Whilst I have already referred to his Honour’s entitlement to reject the psychologist’s opinion as to the appropriate nature of the sentence to be imposed, his Honour was not, in my opinion, entitled to reject out of hand the factual analysis otherwise contained in the report without identifying a proper basis for doing so. I make the same comment in relation to the Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report dated 13 April 2005. The psychologist’s report refers to objective progress in terms of a significant and measurable improvement in the applicant’s attitudes and behaviour in relation to drugs and alcohol abuse and that the results were consistent with abstinence from all substances apart from his methadone maintenance. The report of 13 April 2005 refers to the significant effort that had been made by the applicant in addressing some of his maladaptive behaviour which had contributed to his past offending. It is noted in that report that his compliance on the methadone programme together with the pending birth of his first child and his fear of incarceration have all been significant contributors to his recent change in attitude and behaviour. The report states that it did appear that he had “initiated substantial change over the past six months”. 
     
      
    88 Not only did the sentencing judge not identify a basis upon which these opinions were not to be accepted, but he appears to have based his rejection of the opinions expressed on the question of the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects on what he termed “poor choices about his life since he committed his crime”. That appears to refer to his Honour’s earlier expressed view that the conception of the child, whilst the applicant was on bail, “was irresponsible”. Whether this statement is to be characterised as a moral judgment on the applicant’s behaviour and/or that of his partner or not does not require resolution. It is sufficient to say that that matter, as earlier indicated, was not a relevant consideration to the sentencing judgment which his Honour was required to exercise. 
     
      
    89 I accordingly accept that his Honour, in light of evidence to the contrary, impermissibly formed the conclusion that the applicant had poor rehabilitation prospects and failed, in particular, to identify any cogent basis or reason for doing so. I will return to consider the possible significance of this error in the overall assessment of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: His Honour erred in ignoring the reports of Anita Duffy, psychologist, and thus gave insufficient, or no weight to his subjective circumstances 
       
      
    90 I have already dealt with this matter in relation to the previous ground. 
     
      
    91 The court was required by s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence, as a mitigating factor:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(h) The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, … 
        
       
      
    92 There was material before the sentencing judge which established that he did have prospects of rehabilitation. Whether they could be classed as “good prospects” within the meaning of s.21A(3) is perhaps debatable. His Honour’s unsubstantiated conclusion, however, as to the applicant’s poor prospect of rehabilitation is a matter which is to be borne in mind in determining whether this court ought intervene. It is a further matter which I will refer to later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in refusing to hear further evidence on 2 May 2005 
       
      
    93 Mr. Watts of counsel indicated to this court that he did not press Ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: His Honour failed to take into account the evidence of contrition and remorse by the applicant for his actions and discount his sentence accordingly 
       
      
    94 The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He expressed his remorse for Mrs. Subotic. More importantly, there was recorded in Ms. Duffy’s report statements by the applicant which were supportive of the remorse that he had expressed. Additionally, there is recorded in the probation officer’s pre-sentence report expressions of significant remorse for his actions in having brought about injury to Mrs. Subotic. 
     
      
    95 The weight, if any, to be given to such evidence, of course, is one matter. The dismissal or outright rejection of such evidence, in the absence of an identified basis for doing so, is another. In dealing with this aspect, his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There are also in evidence a number of written testimonials that serve little purpose. I find that it is difficult to accept that this man is genuinely contrite. His expression of contrition seems to me to amount to little more than an expression of his fear of impending imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    96 His Honour did not identify any factual or other material which supported the last two mentioned expressions of opinion. The relevant provision in s.21A(3)(i) is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) The offender has shown remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other matter.” 
        
       
      
    97 Other than the applicant’s own evidence, there was no specific evidence in terms of this provision which demonstrated remorse. That said, it is not, in my opinion, appropriate for a sentencing judge to reject out of hand expressions of remorse unless there is an evidentiary basis for determining that they are either not genuine or are motivated by some extraneous or self-interested factor. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: His Honour fell into error by having additional regard for aggravating features which were elements of the offence, or not made out by the evidence 
       
      
    98 There is no doubt that his Honour regarded “the degree of intoxication” of the offender as having aggravated his crime. That is precisely what his Honour stated. In R. v. McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28, this Court gave consideration, inter alia, to the provisions of s.52A(4) of the Crimes Act. In his judgment in that case, Howie, J. (with whom Santow, JA. and Bell, J. agreed) emphasised the importance of identifying the relevant objective factor which is an element of the offence under the section. The “circumstances of aggravation” as defined in s.52A(7) include, so far as is relevant to the present case, “the accused’s ability to drive was very substantially impaired …” (by virtue of the fact that the applicant was under the influence of the drugs in question). Mr. Watts of counsel contended that the evidence of Dr. Perl could not be relied upon as identifying anything in addition to the substantial impairment (which constituted the element of the offence) and which could be regarded as further aggravating the offence under s.52A(4). I am of the opinion that in that respect the submission is correct. 
     
      
    99 I have earlier referred to the description of the applicant’s condition given by police as recorded in Dr. Perl’s report which does suggest significant impairment. However, the impairment and the nature of the impairment established by the evidence in this case was, as I have stated, an element of the offence itself and could not be utilised as an aggravating circumstance in the way in which his Honour in this case did consider it. (“… must be regarded as aggravating his crime”). 
     
      
    100 One of the factors identified by Spigelman, CJ. in Jurisic (supra) was “degree of intoxication or of substance abuse”. In McMillan (supra), Howie, J. stated (at [38]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… but the offence of driving under the influence, particularly where it is alleged that the driver has a blood alcohol reading over 0.15, is premised on the fact that to drive in such condition is dangerous to other persons on the road. It seems to me that there would be an element of double counting in finding that the offence was aggravated by those factors mentioned in  
        Jurisic 
         and  
        Whyte 
        , which was generally concerned with the danger posed to members of the public by the driving, and then to find that the offence is also aggravated because the driving was without regard to public safety.” 
        
       
      
    101 I believe that the principle here referred to by Howie, J. is relevant to the point presently under consideration. 
     
      
    102 I do not consider that the sentencing judge erred in having regard to the other three factors ((a), (c) and (d)) in the extract which I have previously set out (see paragraph [83]). The serious nature of the injuries, in particular, and their enduring consequences were appropriately considered by his Honour in determining the level of seriousness of the offence in question. 
     
      
    103 Similarly, the exposure to danger of other users of the road by the applicant undertaking his journey was a factor his Honour was entitled to regard as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    104 In relation to the fact that the month before the police had intervened by reason of the applicant’s drug affected state, to my mind, indicates a very high level of moral culpability in the applicant at the time of the offence. I accordingly am of the view that his Honour was not only entitled, but was bound to have regard, to that circumstance as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    105 At the sentencing hearing held on 22 April 2005, the applicant conceded in cross-examination that when he was “picked up” by police on 3 January 2004, the police spoke to him about his drug affected state by reason of the fact that they considered that he was in fact “drug affected” on that occasion. He was also asked:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If I can ask you these questions, when you were picked up – when police approached you in relation to that offence and spoke to you, before they charged you, did you consider at that stage that it was serious to be driving under the influence of drugs? A. Yes I did, but I didn’t think, yeah. I knew it was against the law, I didn’t think. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You knew it was against the law but? A. I didn’t think, I kept on.” 
        
       
      
    106 This evidence confirmed that at the date of the offence, the applicant had abandoned all sense of responsibility and knew that in driving on a busy road in his drug affected state on 6 February 2004 over the distance involved (approximately 18 kilometres) he was doing so illegally and necessarily involving a risk to others. Tragically, that risk materialised with very adverse consequences to Mrs. Subotic. In this respect I adopt the description given by Howie, J. in McMillan (supra) of the circumstances in that case, namely, that the applicant in driving in such a condition “was not simply irresponsible, it was seriously criminal”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    107 I will consider this ground in relation to the errors in sentencing earlier identified. 
     
      
    108 I consider that the sentence imposed in this case effectively of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months, commencing 2 May 2005 was a substantial one. The question is whether taking into account all relevant factors it was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    109 In McMillan (supra), Howie, J. examined the statistical information concerning sentences imposed for sentences contrary to s.58A(3) and for offences under s.52A(4). 
     
      
    110 The sentencing range for offences of the present kind may be determined by reference to the factors identified in McMillan by Howie, J. including, in particular, the following:- 
     
      
       
      • The maximum penalty for an offence under s.52A(4) is greater than that for a non-aggravated offence causing death, the maximum penalty for an offence under s.52A(1) being 10 years, the maximum sentence for an offence under s.52A(4) being 11 years. 
       
       
      • Parliament should be taken as being of the view that generally an offence under s.52A(4) is slightly more serious than an offence under s.52A(1), notwithstanding that the consequences of the driving will be less serious. Yet the statistics show that sentences for an offence under s.52A(1) are markedly more severe than those for an offence under s.52A(4): only 14% of head sentences are less than three years. 
       
       
      • It may well be the case that insufficient regard has been paid to the seriousness of the driving as reflected in the matters of aggravation specified in s.52A(7) and the increased penalties that the aggravated form of the offence attracts. 
       
       
      • In a case of an offence under s.52A(4), the sentencing judge was required to sentence the applicant for an offence of significant gravity before any other objective factor was taken into account. 
       
       
      • Particular factual findings relevant to the degree of moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility are required to be taken into account over and above the substantial impairment referred to in s.52A(7)(d) which, as earlier discussed, is an element of the offence. 
       
       
      • In particular, regard is to be had to those facts indicating the seriousness of the driving, its consequences and the applicant’s record. 
       
      
    111 In McMillan, the circumstance of aggravation was one involving driving with in excess of the prescribed concentration of alcohol, that is, a blood alcohol reading of more than 0.15 (a blood alcohol reading of at least .170). A discount of 20% for the plea of guilty had been allowed by the sentencing judge. Howie, J. classified that case as a very serious instance of an offence under the section aggravated by the abandonment of responsibility by the respondent (aged 56 years) in determining to drive approximately 15 kilometres on a road on which he knew there might be drivers. He had been drinking alcohol at various times throughout the day prior to driving his vehicle. The sentencing judge had found the applicant’s moral culpability in that case to have been high and that the applicant had abandoned responsibility. Those factual findings had to be taken into account over and above the fact that the applicant had had a reading of over 0.15. The applicant’s offending under the influence of alcohol in the past, both generally and specifically in relation to motor vehicles, deprived him of any leniency. The injuries occasioned to the pedestrian were serious. It was an offence, although not the worst of its kind, coming within the upper range of offences of its type. 
     
      
    112 I consider that the facts and circumstances of the present case similarly warrant it to be classified as a very serious instance of an offence under the section but overall a little below the culpability in McMillan. Howie, J. considered that the appropriate starting point in McMillan would have been six years but that it should be moderated because of the existing range of sentences to five years. A discount of 20% reduced the sentence to four years. However, it is important to note that that case was a Crown appeal which required the moderated approach taken. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    113 On the above analysis, the sentencing judge erred in terms of Ground 1 of the application (in failing to allow a proper discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty) and in respect of Ground 7 (in taking into account the degree of intoxication as an aggravating factor when, on the evidence, the substantial impairment established by the evidence constituted an element of the offence). In relation to Ground 1, the sentencing judge determined the utilitarian value of the plea at 20%. The error poses the question whether a further 10% discount on sentence over and above the implicit discount in Jurisic should be allowed. I have additionally determined that the sentencing judge erred in his finding as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and failure to have regard to the evidence of the psychologist and the Probation and Parole report, insofar as they were relevant to subjective circumstances and the failure to have regard to the evidence of contrition and remorse. 
     
      
    114 The ultimate question is whether, in terms of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, notwithstanding established error, this court is of the opinion that a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    115 In circumstances where material error has been established at a number of points in the remarks on sentence, this Court will carefully scrutinise the sentence in question in order to determine whether or not the result of the sentencing process, the sentence itself, has been so affected by such error or errors as to require the intervention of this court. 
     
      
    116 It is necessary for me to only briefly refer to the principles which govern the approach that this Court should take when error has been demonstrated in the sentencing process. In R. v. Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79], Spigelman, CJ. observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ‘if it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process’. That is not the statutory formulation. By s.6(3), this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’ is not satisfied.” 
        
       
      
    117 In AB v. The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111, Hayne, J. observed, inter alia, at 160 (paragraph [130]) that in cases where specific error is identified by an appellate court, the sentence imposed below must be set aside and the appellate court is then required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. His Honour further observed that the offender must be re-sentenced unless, of course, in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion the appellate court concludes that no different sentence should be passed. 
     
      
    118 In R. v. Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186, Hunt, AJA. (Hulme and Johnson, JJ. agreeing), following reference to relevant authority (at [33]) observed that the mere existence of error in a sentence imposed does not permit this court to substitute another sentence for it unless such substituted sentence is warranted in law and should have been imposed. His Honour additionally observed (at [34]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… in cases where the error is apparent, the Court must first consider whether the sentence imposed is outside the appropriate range for the circumstances of the particular case unaffected by that error and, if it is, determine for itself what sentence is warranted in law in substitution for that sentence.” 
          
        
       
      
    119 See also Douar v. Regina [2005] NSWCCA 455 per Johnson, J. at [80] to [123]. 
     
      
    120 In McMillan, Howie, J., referred to the statistical information which revealed that sentences for an offence under s.52A(1) had been markedly more severe than those for an offence under s.52A(4): aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, with only 14% of head sentences being less than three years. Howie, J. observed at [51]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It may well be the case that insufficient regard is being paid to the seriousness of the driving as reflected in the matters of aggravation specified in s.52A(7) and the increased penalties that the aggravated form of the offence attracts …” 
        
       
      
    121 Whilst specific error has been disclosed in the present matter, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant’s moral culpability, which on any assessment of the facts was high, I do not consider that this court could conclude that the ultimate sentence imposed of five years with a non-parole period of two years and six months was outside the range for a case of this level of seriousness. I accordingly do not consider that this court could conclude that a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    122 I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That the application for leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (b) That the appeal be dismissed.

       STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v JANE MOSS 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1    MASON P: In 1988 the respondent was a Year 10 student at a State high school. She suffered severe burns during a science experiment. Proceedings were commenced against the appellant in the Supreme Court and were then transferred to the District Court. The appellant admitted negligence. 
     
      
    2    The assessment of damages was undertaken in 1998 by jury in a trial presided over by Judge Sinclair QC. The jury awarded a verdict of $799,580. In the light of the way the case had gone to the jury, the parties were able to agree that the verdict should be treated as containing the following integers: 
     
      
      General damages $225,000 
       
      Past wage loss $ 20,000 
       
      Future wage loss $330,356 
       
      Past medical and hospital expenses $ 64,500 
       
      Future medical and hospital expenses $ 79,724 
       
      Past voluntary assistance $ 80,000 
       
       Total $799,580 
       
       
      
    3    It was necessary to work out what interest was payable on the verdict and to allow the appellant credit for payments already made. As to interest, it was held that the respondent was entitled to interest on $112,500 (half of general damages) for 10.15 years at the rate of 2%. This came to $22,837. It was further ordered that the respondent was entitled to interest totalling $89,100 with respect to the award for past voluntary assistance and to interest totalling $20,000 with respect to the award for past economic loss. When these sums were added to the jury's verdict and when the appellant was allowed credit in respect of payments already made by it, the resultant figure was $873,529. Judgment was entered in this sum. 
     
      
    4    At the time of the accident the respondent was an attractive young woman, aged 14. In response to a question whether she was a good student she replied ""not bad. I wouldn't say bad”. Her long-term ambition was to become a hairdresser. There was ample material before the jury capable of satisfying them that she would have achieved this goal had the cosmetic and physical injuries suffered in the accident not prevented it. She already had a part-time job. She had studied typing. Despite her horrific injuries, suffered in June 1988, her school certificate results at the end of that year were commendable. She had never returned to school after the accident, but had studied at home with the assistance of a tutor. Her post injury employment record and her capacity to get on with life after the accident demonstrated considerable drive and capacity. She was a competitive sportswoman, playing netball regularly and (for the two years prior to the trial in 1998) being involved in the administration of a netball competition. She was fortunate to have the support of caring parents and, latterly, of her husband. It would appear that she continued in paid employment right up to the birth of her two children in October 1995 and May 1998 and that she returned to paid employment fairly soon after each child's birth. 
     
      
    5    The accident in the science laboratory involved an experiment to extract fat from a sausage. The sausage was put into a beaker and heated over a tripod. Methylated spirits was poured into the beaker and there was an explosion. There was extensive burning to the whole of the respondent's face and most of her neck. The front and back of her hands were terribly burnt. There was also burning over much of the front of her body, including her right breast and over parts of her legs. 
     
      
    6    The respondent was in intensive care at Westmead hospital for two and half weeks and she spent a further three and half weeks in the burns unit at that hospital. She then returned to her parents’ home. As indicated above, she never went back to school. There were many return visits to hospital for skin grafts, operations on her hands, operations on her ears (which on the outside had been reduced to small cauliflowers). There was extensive physiotherapy. For two and half years the respondent wore a pressure suit, known as a Jobst suit. This was painful and unsightly and the respondent needed help to get it on and off each day. The scarring was not just physical: the respondent required psychotherapy to cope with the anger, distress and sense of loss experienced in her teenage years. 
     
      
    7    Considerable scarring remains. According to a 1997 report from her plastic surgeon Mr Thompson, there remains very extensive visible burn scarring involving all areas of the respondent’s face and the front of her neck and particular disfigurement of both external ears. The facial disfigurement is gross, visible and impossible to disguise adequately. No further surgical treatment is likely to ameliorate the overall impact of the facial scarring, which will be permanent and lifelong. There is also gross disfigurement of both hands which is impossible to disguise. The breast scarring caused difficulties in feeding the respondent's first daughter. The deformed ears remain very ugly. The respondent's hands are tight and cramped at times. The sensitivity of her skin means that she is restricted in exposing it to sunlight and needs special cosmetics. 
     
      
    8    In their final addresses to the jury, counsel for each party spoke to Schedules of Damages which they had prepared and which were given to the jury. The respondent's Schedule was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. 
          
        GENERAL DAMAGES 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The plaintiff has suffered horrific injuries. She has gross scarring of the face, neck, breast and hands. She has large graft patches on her thighs and burn marks on her legs. She has distorted buds where her ears were. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) She has undergone about 12 operations, mainly involving skin grafts with skin cut from her thighs. Her last admission to hospital was only 14 months ago. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) In the course of her treatment she has been subjected to exquisitely painful procedures such as the daily baths to scrape off skin in her first admission and the scouring of her ears by her mother at home. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) She wore an ugly, constricting and uncomfortable pressure suit for two years. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) She has suffered and will suffer for the rest of her life (57 years) the mental anguish associated with her disfigurement and the loss of her self worth. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) She has suffered acute depression and post traumatic stress disorder for years and continues to suffer those conditions to a lesser degree. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) She is vulnerable to life stresses with which other people could cope, with the result that for her these stresses would probably result in depressive illness, with the further disruption of her life and the further need for psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) She is restricted in where she can go (she must avoid sunlight) and what she can do (her hands, particularly, cannot stand exertion or trauma). 
        
       
       
        
        (i) She is constantly reminded by the thoughtlessness of others of the serious compromise of her former beauty. This will never change. 
        
       
       
        
        (j) She has the constant chore of having to protect her skin with creams and to apply special make-up which partially masks some of her scars. 
        
       
       
        
        (k) She suffers from constant obsessive thoughts of what might have been if she had not been burned. 
        
       
       
        
        2. PAST WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        It is difficult to be precise about the plaintiff’s loss to date. She lost the best part of a year in 1989 and is entitled to be paid for the holiday pay which she took when she had to have operations. 
        
       
       
        
        As well, there have been broken periods when the plaintiff has not worked, or not worked as much as she otherwise would have. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to her relatively low earnings to date, it is submitted an appropriate allowance over the 10 years to date would be $20,000 
        
       
       
        
        3. FUTURE WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The present average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales is $500 per week. The plaintiff averages less than $300 per week, a difference of $200 per week. Over 40 years, to age 65, that throws up a loss of $244,840. Discounted by 10%, that is $220,356 
        
       
       
        
        (b) In addition, an amount ought to be allowed for the loss by the plaintiff of the opportunity to run her own business and to earn substantially above the average. No precise figures appear in the evidence, but it is submitted an appropriate sum would be $110,000 which represents a further $100 per week over 40 years discounted by 10%. Allow - $110,000 
        
       
       
        
        4. PAST MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        Agreed figure - $64,500 
        
       
       
        
        5. FUTURE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Cosmetics, sun screen, moisturiser $12 per week for 57 years (multiplier $143.90). Allow - $17,255 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Hospital and medical excluding psychological costs (see Dr Thompson, report 25 September 1997, estimate of $14,000). Allow - $10,000 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Psychological treatment - 
        
       
       
        
        • Dr Edwards - psychological consultation weekly for two years at $142 (multiplier $1-1.30): $14,389 
         
        • Then three-weekly for further eight years $16,595 
        
       
       
        
        (d) It is submitted that on the evidence of Drs Milton and Dyball as to the plaintiff’s vulnerability to life events, an amount should be allowed as a buffer for the years from year 11 to year 57. Allow - $25,000 
        
       
       
        
        6. PAST VOLUNTARY ASSISTANCE 
        
       
       
        
        (See separate schedule) 
         
        
       
      
    9    It can be seen that this document served at least four purposes: it showed the breakup of damages claimed by the respondent; secondly, it showed what items were agreed and what items were at issue; thirdly, it stated the maximum sums claimed for items of special damages; fourthly, it summarised the basis upon which the respondent advanced her claim under some of the heads of damage. 
     
      
    10    The two schedules went to the jury without objection on either side. They were referred to by counsel in addresses. It is not suggested that any assertion in the respondent's schedule was contrary to the evidence.  
     
      
    11    Judge Sinclair summed up to the jury on 13 August 1998. At the end of the summing up counsel for the appellant (the defendant in the court below) raised minor items of redirection that are not presently relevant. While developing his submission on one point, he contended that the trial judge had usurped the function of the jury and prejudiced the defendant's case. Asked whether he was asking for a discharge of the jury, counsel said that he did not have those instructions. Counsel then reverted to a rather confusing submission about future economic loss. It is hardly surprising that his Honour directed counsel to put in writing the redirection which he sought and to make it available to his opponent and to the judge by 9.15am the following morning. 
     
      
    12    No redirection was sought the following morning. Instead, counsel for the defendant applied for a discharge of the jury. The application was refused. The judge again invited counsel for the defendant to seek further directions, preferably in writing, if he had matters of complaint. No further direction was sought. 
     
      
    13    The appellant's failure to seek a redirection is not necessarily fatal, although it is a most material matter in determining whether there was a substantial wrong or miscarriage (Pt 51 r23, General Motors-Holden’s Pty Ltd v Moularas (1964) 111 CLR 234, Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 at 39). 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 to 3 (unbalanced summing up) 
       
      
    14    Taken together, these grounds assert that the trial judge was partisan and unduly favourable to the respondent in his summing up. Eleven passages are identified in the written submissions. It is unnecessary to set them out in this judgment, all the more so because the appellant accepts that they must be read in the context of the summing up as a whole. 
     
      
    15    The summing up contains the conventional information about the respective roles of judge and jury. The jury were cautioned against inferring that the judge held any view as to the facts and told that they were not bound by such view in any event. Of course, such remarks will not insulate an otherwise unbalanced summing up from appellate review.  
     
      
    16    I shall deal separately with the portions of the summing up relating to the income that would have been earned had the respondent been able to pursue the goal of owning her own hairdressing business. The remaining passages did not cause the trial to miscarry. Some of the impugned comments merely restate the arguments of the respondent at trial. None are unsupported by the evidence (with the possible exception of those concerning the hairdressing business). The references to ""the horrific happening"" and the ""ghastly outfit called a Jobst suit"" were statements of the obvious. 
     
      
    17    The challenge to the remark about the likelihood that the respondent would have made ""a good result of her life"" had she not been injured was clearly supportable on the evidence. Like the statement “everybody says this is a lady who has got bags of guts”, it was as relevant to the appellant's case as it was to the respondent's case. 
     
      
    18    A judge does not descend into the arena merely because he or she expresses a view about the facts favourable to one party. 
     
      
    19    In the light of the way the trial proceeded to verdict the appellant’s challenge based on partisanship clearly fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 (value of lost opportunity to be a hairdresser) 
       
      
    20    The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving to the jury the respondent's claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct her own hairdressing business, there being no evidence of the earnings of self-employed hairdressers. 
     
      
    21    As stated above, the appellant faces the hurdle of establishing a substantial wrong or miscarriage in the context of a summing up about which no relevant redirection was sought. 
     
      
    22    The amended Statement of Particulars filed on behalf of the respondent well prior to the trial foreshadowed a claim that the injuries caused her to lose the opportunity of working as a hairdresser as well as the opportunity of owning and working in her own hairdressing salon. Her ambition to have done so is not in issue. And the appellant does not dispute that the cosmetic injuries and the injuries to the respondent's hands combined to prevent her from pursuing such employment.  
     
      
    23    The Schedule of Damages upon which counsel for the respondent addressed shows that the claim for “future wage loss” over 40 years set off the respondent's pattern of actual earnings to reach a two-part figure: 
     
      
       
        
        - average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales $500 per week = $220, 356 
         
        - additional allowance for the respondent's loss of the opportunity to run her own hairdressing business, claimed at the rate of an additional $100 per week = $110, 000. 
        
       
      
    24    The jury awarded these sums in full. The appellant complains about the additional $110,000. 
     
      
    25    It should be said at the outset that the jury were entitled to conclude that the respondent's prospects were ""above-average"". They saw her give evidence. They were entitled to view her prospects favourably, given the drive and resourcefulness which she had demonstrated before and after the accident, together with the evidence as to parental support which she was fortunate to have. The evidence is summarised above. The jury were clearly entitled to conclude that the respondent would probably have achieved her goal of becoming a hairdresser and eventually owning her own hairdressing salon, although it ought to have been understood that this would not have occurred overnight. 
     
      
    26    The appellant’s submission as refined in argument accepts these matters. At the end of the day the nub of the complaint is the absence of evidence to support the proposition that a hairdressing business could or would have projected the respondent's earnings beyond those of the average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales ($500 per week). Cf Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks (1957) 97 CLR 367. The real issue is whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the loss of that opportunity was productive of financial loss (Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347). 
     
      
    27    I had originally been troubled by this ground of appeal. However, the judgment of Heydon JA with which I respectfully agree has allayed my concerns. I agree with what his Honour has written and would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 (vicissitudes) 
       
      
    28    The appellant complains about the directions in relation to the conventional deduction for vicissitudes. It will be seen that this was an area where a specific objection was taken about the summing up. 
     
      
    29    In the respondent's Schedule of Damages (par 8 above) the respondent proposed a discount of 10 percent in the calculation of future economic loss. As will be seen below, the jury were invited to choose a factor between 10% and 15% and they chose 10%. The jury awarded the respondent everything that she claimed in regard to economic loss. 
     
      
    30    The relevant direction, the complaint made about it at trial, and the trial judge's response to that complaint were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Then you have got this question of diminution of earning capacity, and in relation to that you have got paragraph 3, “future wage loss”, and you see the basis of the submissions put to you by counsel for the plaintiff and what figures he takes.  
        I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you. 
          
        
       
       
        
        Because the law says that, for instance, when you are calculating a future wage loss, take a simple example of $10 a week for the next twenty years of a fellow’s life. He might have chopped a bit of his finger off, but not much otherwise. You do not say that is $10 a year for this and this, and $10 a week for this, so that is $500 a year and ten years is $5,000 and so forth, because you would arrive at a sum which is far too much. What you have to take into account in your verdict is the present lump sum value of so much a week. There may be cases when you cannot do it on that basis, but whatever approach you take, frankly, you have to take some approach to start with to get an idea of what it is really worth, and the law says you go to the tables produced by actuaries and that is why you were given that figure, the multiplier, by counsel for the plaintiff. And so you have got the multiplier there. A dollar a week for the next 40 years is $1,224. If you were going to give her $100 a week then you put two noughts on the end of that. 
        
       
       
        
        And then you might say “what is this discount by 10 per cent”. That is another thing. The law says that when assessing the value of the diminution of earning capacity in the future, you must take into account the “vicissitudes” is a word I have always used, but it now seems to be exigencies of life. In other words, if you had a simple fellow who had a simple job and a set wage and then he lost his leg or something, and you are looking at assessing his loss of wages in the future  
        you have got to take into account the facts of life.  
        
       
       
        
        How many people go through life working five days a week for 40 years without  
        having a bit of time off for something 
        .  
        Either they get an illness, or prang the car, or have an argument with the boss and they have to find a job somewhere else. That is some pretty rough examples of what vicissitudes of life is, and the court says then you come to your figure of diminution of earning capacity, you must then make a reasonable discount, again bearing in mind a particular plaintiff as to vicissitudes of life 
        . After all, if the plaintiff in another case with a broken leg had not been in another job for a couple of months, and had an unfortunate habit of spending too long in the pub of a Friday night, and might even have got knocked down on the way home, that is the vicissitudes of life and that is why the discount is there. It has been suggested at 10 per cent by counsel for the plaintiff and I do not think any other figure has been suggested by counsel for the defendant, am I right? 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: I haven’t your Honour, but your Honour would know that 10 per cent is not the normal vicissitude of life. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not concerned with normal I am concerned with the plaintiff, and I asked you to give me submissions. 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: Well 15 per cent, if the jury gets that far, I would submit that it is 15 per cent. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:  
        Members of the jury, your range is 10 to 15 per cent 
        .  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    31    It was clear that the respondent was not going to earn $600 per week for an unbroken period of 40 years. For workers generally and for this plaintiff in particular there would be many contingencies or vicissitudes, positive and negative, properly to be taken into account. In this State 15% is a conventional starting point, as counsel reminded his Honour. 
     
      
    32    The appellant relies upon the following passage in the judgment of Beazley JA (with whom Powell JA and I agreed) in Nestle Australia v McDougall, Court of Appeal, unreported, 24 June 1998:  
     
      
       
        
        It is accepted that the “usual deduction” for contingencies is 15%. This percentage was accepted by the High Court as “the practice” in New South Wales, “subject to adjustment up or down to take account of the plaintiff’s particular circumstances”: see  
        Wynn 
         at 498. See also  
        Moran v McMahon 
         (1985) 3 NSWLR 700 at 713-714;

         [1982] 2 NSWLR 26 at 30;  
        Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Pelosi 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 2 February 1996). See also  
        Government Insurance Office of NSW v Wojnar 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 15 December 1988) at 13 where Kirby P stated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “A conventional discount of 15% … is allowed in many cases, although this Court has been at pains to say that there is no warrant for inflexibility in fixing the appropriate deduction. The eventualities which people, individually, are likely to face in their lives necessarily vary enormously. They are particular to each injured claimant.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A survey of the authorities reveals that discounts of up to 40% have been applied for vicissitudes.  
        Urban Transit Authority of New South Wales v Seitis 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 17 May 1995) was one such case, where this Court increased the discount for vicissitudes from 25% to 40% where the plaintiff had cerebral palsy. It should be noted, however, that a 40% discount has been described as “high”:  
        New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation v Sprengnagel 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 28 March 1995) per Priestley JA at 8. 
        
       
       
      
    33    The principal negative contingencies or “vicissitudes” that are normally taken into account are sickness, accident, unemployment and industrial disputes (Wynn v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 485 at 497). The latter two considerations were unlikely to impact markedly upon the trade of female hairdressing, assuming (as was the case presented) that the respondent was effectively locked into this perspective. This left sickness or accident and they were covered by the trial judge’s directions.  
     
      
    34    Should the trial judge have told the jury that 15% was conventional in New South Wales? Failure to have done so was not, in my view, itself an error leading to a substantial miscarriage given the facts of this case and the appellant’s failure, through counsel, to press the trial judge for a more specific direction concerning vicissitudes in which reasons for not departing from the conventional figure were outlined. 
     
      
    35    The nub of the appellant’s complaint on this head is that the direction given by his Honour did not suggest any reasons why a lower than usual discount might be appropriate for this respondent. She was married with two young children, so the likelihood was that greater rather than less interruptions might be on the cards even for a modern working wife. Judicial statements about the relevance of individual circumstances are usually made in order to indicate that a greater than usual discount is called for, except for particular plaintiffs in occupations that enjoy high levels of security (see Luntz op cit pp285-6). To have left the jury with choosing between a 10-15% range was inadequate, notwithstanding the perfunctory submissions of the appellant’s counsel at trial. The respondent’s drive and capacity to work and to earn higher than average had been addressed (however adequately) in the jury’s consideration of a starting point for the respondents pre-injury earning capacity ie the figures of $500 or $600 per week as the case was advanced by the respondent. This was the universe of discourse in which progression through apprenticeship to full employment to proprietorship was addressed. Additional remuneration through promotion was hardly apposite to self-employment in a hairdressing business. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 (general damages excessive) 
       
      
    36    As indicated above, the parties agreed that $225,000 was awarded for general damages. The appellant submits that this was excessive when one takes into account the fact that the respondent was able to achieve a stable domestic situation, marrying and bearing two children, and obtaining steady employment. She had played netball regularly for six years at date of trial and had also, at times, played touch football and indoor cricket. 
     
      
    37    The appellant sought to compare the jury's award with the sums payable for a most extreme case under the Motor Accidents Act and the maximum allowable for a work injury under the Workers Compensation Act. This is not a proper basis for challenging an uncapped jury verdict. 
     
      
    38    I have briefly summarised the extent and the impact of the respondent's injuries and the disabilities stemming from them. There was extensive pain and suffering over a prolonged period, exacerbated by frequent return visits to hospital for further treatment and painful surgery. The accident occurred in the respondent's teenage years, scarring her physically and emotionally at a critical time in her life. The scars remain (to an extent) and they will remain throughout her life. The award for general damages was within an acceptable range. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 (use of written submissions in the form of the Schedule of Damages) 
       
      
    39    It is convenient to address ground 8 before ground 7. The Schedule of Damages is set out at par 8 above. 
     
      
    40    The blunt and largely undeveloped submission of the appellant that the trial judge ought not to have allowed counsel to provide written submissions to the jury deserves an equally blunt: “Why not?”. The particular Schedule is a helpful summary that must have been of assistance to the jury. Its use as an aide memoire went without protest and was matched by the appellant’s use of its own Schedule.  
     
      
    41    The Court was not referred to any case law on the broader issue. Even in the criminal law it may be appropriate for a summary to go to a jury, although the court retains a wide discretion, the practice is exceptional and demonstrated assistance to the jury (not just to a party) is critical (see Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 190, Tripodina and Morabito v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 183, Savvas (1989) 45 A Crim R 38). In Savvas Hunt J said (at 39):  
     
      
       
        
        In civil trials, juries are often assisted by documents based upon the evidence which are put before them during the course of the closing addresses. I have in mind, in particular, calculations of damages in personal injury cases. It goes without saying that such documents usually set out the contentions of one party only and that there is often a number of elements in the equations worked out in those documents which are the subject of strong dispute in the evidence. That circumstance does not affect the validity of the practice in civil trials. Counsel could have dictated the detail in the document to the jurors, who would then have written down their own record of the addresses. The document is permitted to be given to the jurors for the sake of convenience and expedition.  
        
       
       
        
        Jurors are correctly credited with sufficient commonsense to be able to appreciate the fact that some of the elements in the documents before them are in dispute. But, in no civil case would it be considered appropriate for such a document to go before the jury where it contains propositions of doubtful or spurious validity. The emphasis which a written document gives to such a proposition is not easily overcome by oral directions given by the trial judge in order to correct them. It would be quite unfair for such documents to go before a jury when they are considering their verdict. 
        
       
       
      
    42    In the light of these principles and the way the case was conducted at trial, no miscarriage occurred as the result of the reliance upon the respondent’s Schedule of Damages. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 (particular misdirection) 
       
      
    43    The following passage in the summing up is said to involve a misdirection: 
     
      
       
        
        All the other things really come under general damages and in relation to general damages, you may well come to the conclusion that the two big figures that you have to start thinking about are the diminution in her earning capacity as a result of these terms and also a round figure to compensate for loss of enjoyment and disfigurement. 
        
       
       
      
    44    This direction is said to have been likely to have contributed to double counting in the context of the Schedule of Damages and the trial judge's later suggestion: “I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you”. 
     
      
    45    The absence of complaint at trial is fatal to this ground of appeal. In my view, this is speculative. The passage does not strike me as carrying the risk of confusion or doubling up on damages that the appellant submits. It is to be read in the context of the summing up as a whole. The Schedule of Damages was quite clear as to what the respondent was seeking. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 (medical reports) 
       
      
    46    Certain medical reports went to the jury before they were tendered. The matter was drawn to the judge’s attention, the reports were then tendered and admitted without objection. The appellant’s concession that this ground would not justify appellate intervention was correctly made. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 (particular misdirection) 
       
      
    47    This ground should be dismissed for the reasons given by Heydon JA. 
     
      
       
      Disposition 
       
      
    48    The parties invited the Court to reassess damages if error was found (cf Supreme Court Act, s107). Not surprisingly, the respondent invited us to keep our eyes on the separate items making up the jury’s verdict, only interfering with particular segments to the extent that error is found. Nevertheless, both parties recognised that our duty was to consider the total verdict as part of a reassessment if we felt able to do this. 
     
      
    49    Since there was no basis on the facts for departing from the conventional 15% discount for vicissitudes that component should be adjusted from 10% to 15%. I see no reason why the jury’s assessment on the remaining matters should not be accepted. 
     
      
    50    I propose that the appeal should be upheld in part by varying the verdict accordingly with the parties being directed to deliver Short Minutes to the Registrar within 7 days. 
     
      
    51    I also propose that the appellant should pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal. The appellant failed on most issues and the point on which the appellant achieved partial success was one on which the trial judge should have received greater assistance from the defendant at trial. 
     
      
    52    HANDLEY JA: I agree with Mason P. 
     
      
    53    HEYDON JA: I agree with Mason P in relation to Grounds 1-3, 6 and 7.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
      
    54    Ground 4 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in leaving to the jury the respondent’s claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct her own hairdressing business, there being no evidence at all of the earnings of self-employed hairdressers.” 
        
       
       
       
      Ground 4: The course of the trial 
       
      
    55    The Amended Notice of Appeal sought an order for a new trial, or, in the alternative, a reassessment of damages by the Court of Appeal. Either step would involve an exercise of discretion by the Court. It would be relevant to the exercise of that discretion to know what was said and what was not said to the trial judge and to the jury, and why. Apart from the two Schedules, the trial judge’s summary of argument in his summing up, a brief address by counsel for the defendant after the summing up, and the judge’s remarks in rejecting an application to discharge the jury, there are no materials before this Court indicating what was said to the trial judge and to the jury. The plaintiff’s Schedule conceded that there was no evidence of “precise figures” for the earnings of hairdressing businesses. The trial judge told the jury: “you do not really have the figures of what people earn in hairdressing salons”. If there was an available “no evidence” point to be taken at the trial by the defendant with a view to preventing jury consideration of the issue, it was quite explicitly flagged by both the plaintiff and the trial judge. And if as a matter of substantive reasoning there was a significant weakness which the jury should have taken into account in the plaintiff’s contention, both the plaintiff and the trial judge advised them of it, whatever the defendant did. 
     
      
    56    After the trial judge’s summing up to the jury concluded, counsel for the defendant made various complaints about the summing up. One related to future economic loss, and was put as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is my submission that your Honour has not put fairly the defendant’s argument in the way the defendant has run its case, that the jury has an option that it need not award the plaintiff damages for future economic loss because your Honour’s summing up to the jury was really that they must give her something and it was the matter of how that was to be calculated. Whether it was to be calculated by way of a precise mathematical calculation or a diminution, and to that extent your Honour it is my submission that your Honour has to that extent usurped the function of the jury and prejudiced the defendant’s case.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel was asked whether he wanted the jury discharged. He said he did not have those instructions, and continued: 
       
       
        
        “I would ask your Honour to at least tell the jury that it is entitled to consider the option put forward by the defendant, that is that it does not have to award the plaintiff for various reasons and in respect of damages for both past and future economic loss, whereas the jury, in my submission, was left with the distinct impression that they were going to have to make an award of damages under both heads. That does not follow on the evidence in my submission.” 
        
       
       
      The following day no redirection was sought. 
       
      
    57    In short, there was no specific complaint about a lack of evidence in relation to the component of damages for impairment of earning capacity so far as related to future economic loss of the type which is now advanced. Senior Counsel for the defendant (who did not appear at the trial) conceded that no submission that the claim should not have been put to the jury for want of evidence was made to the trial judge. 
     
      
    58    The defendant sought to characterise the conduct of its counsel at the trial in not seeking a direction or redirection conforming with Ground 4 as having been mistaken, and as being something which created an obstacle to its success on appeal. That is probably a mischaracterisation, because, as is suggested below, had counsel behaved as the defendant now suggests that he should have done, the direction which supposedly should have been sought would have been refused, rightly, by the trial judge. But if the defendant was right in criticising the conduct of its counsel, that conduct would call for some evidentiary explanation. The nature of the explanation would be relevant to the discretion which the defendant now asks this Court to exercise. No explanation appears from the appeal papers, and none was offered in affidavit form. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The course of the appeal 
      
    59    Ground 4 did not appear as one of the grounds in the Notice of Appeal filed on 18 March 1999. Apart from the question of the correct discount figure for vicissitudes (which is now Ground 5), the only grounds relating to damages for lost earning capacity were expressed in paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) his Honour gave undue emphasis to the respondent’s submissions on economic loss and failed to put the evidence, or for that matter the appellant’s submissions, that it was open for the jury to find that the respondent suffered no future economic loss and no past economic loss apart from a nine month period in 1989; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) his Honour confused the jury by directing them to assess loss of future economic loss [sic] on the balance of the [sic] probabilities and later by an evaluation of possibilities …”. 
        
       
       
      Sub-paragraph (c) is not a “no evidence” ground, and sub-paragraph (b) is not expressed as a no evidence ground but as a ground that invites recourse to the “evidence” which the trial judge allegedly “failed to put”. Neither of these grounds was taken in the Amended Notice of Appeal filed when the hearing of the appeal commenced.  
       
      
    60    Nothing corresponding with Ground 4 appears in the Pt 51 r 8 affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant. All it relevantly said was: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was no evidence called by the respondent from a hairdresser who owned his/her own business, nor were any earnings tendered. The claim is unsupported by evidence and should not have been awarded by the jury.” 
        
       
       
      That is an attack upon the validity of the jury’s reasoning processes, not on the conduct of the judge in leaving the matter to the jury.  
       
      
    61    Thus the defendant failed to take Ground 4 as a point in address to the jury before the summing up, after the summing up, in the Notice of Appeal, or in the Pt 51 r 8 affidavit. Each of these failures illustrates clearly the extent to which the defendant on appeal has departed from the manner in which it conducted the trial.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The structure of the argument 
      
    62    The structure of the argument in relation to Ground 4 so far as the defendant is concerned is curious. Had the plaintiff below not run a case based on a loss of an opportunity to own a hairdressing business, but rather aimed at the same ultimate figure for damages in relation to injury to earning capacity by reference to future economic loss through a contention that with her drive and ability the plaintiff would have earned $600 per week as an employee, the criticism that there was an absence of evidence could not have been put with any plausibility at all. The fact that the plaintiff’s case based on reduced capacity to earn was put as turning in part on the loss of an opportunity to run a hairdressing business was in a sense adventitious. What matters is how much the plaintiff’s capacity to earn was reduced. Loss of a chance to earn income as proprietor of a hairdressing business is only one way of viewing that reduction in capacity. Another way of viewing it is as the loss of a chance to earn income as an employee from hairdressing or from some other occupation. In Bullock v Miller (1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-128 at 68,990-68,991 Underwood J inferred from the family background and intellectual capacity of the plaintiff, who was five when rendered incapable of work, that he would have stayed at school until 17 or 18 and then become apprenticed in a trade which would have provided him with his livelihood either as an employee or as the proprietor of his own business. Underwood J took the average of awards in various distinct trades. He increased the capital sum derived from that average because “the family background, intelligence and personality of the plaintiff is such that it is highly probable he very quickly would have been earning in excess of the minimum prescribed by the award”. The jury were entitled to conclude that the present plaintiff could have earned more than the minimum wage, and indeed more than average weekly earnings. Her background, together with her intelligence, drive and personality, were established before the injury happened to her just before her fifteenth birthday, when she was much older than the plaintiff before Underwood J. Her circumstances were thus capable of supporting stronger conclusions than those reached by Underwood J. Yet the force of Underwood J’s reasoning does not depend on any distinction between a career as an employee or a career as a proprietor. Nor does it depend on the selection of any particular trade. The point is that the position of the plaintiff before Underwood J could be analysed by reference to any of those trades. While the position of the present plaintiff can be analysed by reference to hairdressing, the value of the lost chance to exploit her impaired capacity to earn does not depend on that analysis alone.  
     
      
    63    The characterisation of the issue in Ground 4 as relating to a “claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct [a] hairdressing business” follows the language of paragraph 3(b) of the plaintiff’s Schedule. This had the effect of drawing a false distinction between paragraph 3(b) and paragraph 3(a). In truth the assessment of damages for loss of earning capacity in relation to the future in every respect relates to the loss of an opportunity, or, as is now often said, the loss of a chance. The two parts of paragraph 3 wrongly suggest that one process of analysis is called for where the lost capacity is valued by reference to loss of wages, while another is called for where it is valued by reference to loss of profits. In each the process of analysis is the same: what is the monetary value of the lost chance to exploit the lost - or damaged or removed or amputated - capacity to earn income, by wages or otherwise, in future? The division of paragraph 3 into two parts was no doubt done merely to articulate one way of casting light on the value of the plaintiff’s lost capacity to earn.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The plaintiff’s entitlement to some damages for injury to earning capacity by reference to future economic loss 
       
      
    64    There is no doubt that the plaintiff was entitled to some damages corresponding to future economic loss in order to compensate her for her reduced capacity to earn. Leaving aside the fact that the defendant conceded on the appeal that there was no challenge to the $220,356 of the $330,356 which the parties identified as referable to future economic loss, there are two reasons for the plaintiff’s entitlement. First, the plaintiff had suffered some past economic loss. Since a reduced capacity to earn is reflected both before the trial and after it, evidence of past economic loss is some, though not conclusive, evidence of reduced earning capacity. It is not conclusive, because, for example, a banking executive might lose income by reason of a painful injury to the little finger of his left hand but, after returning to work, be capable of continuing to work without any impairment in earning capacity. Where there is impairment in earning capacity it will usually be reflected in financial loss before the trial. The second reason why the plaintiff was entitled to some damages in relation to reduced capacity to earn was that there was ample evidence of the effect of her injuries on her appearance, self-confidence and mental state, and in causing the need for absences from work over the years for medical purposes. These factors plainly point to a reduced earning capacity.  
     
      
    65    The case, then, is not one of which it can be said that there was no evidence of any impairment of capacity to earn. Since there was some evidence of impaired earning capacity, it would have been wrong, on the authorities, for the trier of fact to conclude that damages to compensate for it should only be nil or nominal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Some authorities 
      
    66    There are two uncontroversial themes running through the cases relating to the assessment of damages for injury to earning capacity. One is that in general it is desirable for precise evidence to be called as to what the plaintiff would have been likely to earn but for the injury and what the plaintiff is likely to earn after it. The second is that the failure to call such evidence does not necessarily result in selection of only a nil or nominal figure as damages for impaired earning capacity. 
     
      
    67    Thus, in relation to the first of these themes, in Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 559 Fullagar J said that the “usual method of proving damages under [this] head is by calling evidence to show what the plaintiff could probably have earned during the rest of his life if he had not been injured and what, if anything, he is now capable of earning”. The same is true where the defendant is seeking to demonstrate that the diminution of earning capacity is only partial. Barwick CJ in Arthur Robinson (Grafton) Pty Ltd v Carter (1968) 122 CLR 649 at 657 said of a plaintiff who had been rendered almost a quadriplegic:  
     
      
       
        
        “He has lost his earning capacity, so far as the evidence goes, all earning capacity. In this connexion, however, too little attention it seems to me is paid to the possibilities which have and will yet open up for paraplegics and quadriplegics: but this ought to be the subject of the evidence and not of mere suggestion on the part of judge or advocate.” 
        
       
      
    68    The first theme was stated with the qualification “in general”, because there is authority that in some circumstances over-elaborate evidence is unhelpful. In J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 734-5 Moffitt P said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sometimes, particularly in a jury trial, evidence of some claimed prospective earnings but for injury may distract rather than aid quantification of loss. A jury may well make a better assessment of the loss of a young law student debarred by injury from becoming a barrister by evidence such as in  
        Gilles 
        ’ case [(1975) 49 ALJR 349] uncluttered by evidence of earnings made by selected leading senior counsel, with or without the aid of statistics as to success and failure rates of students and barristers, where such evidence is led in supposed aid of quantifying the lost opportunity of becoming leading counsel in the foggy future.” 
        
       
       
      This approach may rest on a general recognition that “the task of assessing damages in personal injuries cases should be kept as simple as possible”:  
      Jongen v CSR Ltd 
       (1992) Aust Torts Reports 81-192 at 61,713 per Anderson J.  
       
      
    69    The second theme in the authorities was summed up by Reynolds JA in Yammine v Kalwy [1979] 2 NSWLR 151 at 155 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “in seeking to quantify his damages, a plaintiff could be well advised to offer [evidence of wage levels] in many cases; and likewise a defendant, in seeking to cut down the damage, might similarly be well advised to tender such evidence; neither, in the absence of such evidence, could complain, to the same effect, at any quantification arrived at. This, however, is far from asserting that in the absence of such evidence only nominal damages is appropriate. …[W]here a plaintiff has suffered a significantly disabling injury which obviously affects the range and nature of the work he can, therefore, perform, a tribunal of fact can, without specific evidence as to what other persons with that kind of disability can earn, make a judgment and assessment, on a percentage basis or otherwise, of the value of the lost capacity.” 
        
       
       
      Where the plaintiff calls incomplete evidence and there is only a low award for diminution of earning capacity, it is difficult for the plaintiff to complain:  
      Minchin v Public Curator of Queensland 
       [1965] ALR 91 at 93;  
      Giorginis v Kastrati  
      (1998) 49 SASR 371 at 375. But it does not follow that a substantial award in a case where the evidence is incomplete cannot survive appellate attack by the defendant:  
      Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death, 
       3rd ed, para [1.9.28] 
      .  
      This is so for several reasons.  
       
      
    70    First, damages to compensate for that part of reduced economic capacity which will be reflected in the future are sometimes analysed as being one type of “general damages”. Like other types of “general damages”, as Fullagar J said in Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 559, they are “of their very nature, incapable of mathematical calculation and (although the expression is apt to be misleading) commonly very much ‘at large’. They are also at large in the sense that a jury has, in serious cases, a wide discretion in assessing them.” In Russell v J Hargreaves & Sons Pty Ltd (1956) 30 ALJ 533 at 534 Taylor J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since … it is impossible to prescribe fixed or precise standards for the translation into terms of money of physical injuries and pain and suffering and varying degrees of physical incapacity, it is inevitable that individual opinions as to what amount may be said to constitute full compensation in any particular case will vary. Indeed within the bounds of reasonableness they may vary greatly.” 
        
       
       
      The field is an “uncertain” one:  
      Breska v Lysaghts Works Pty Ltd 
       (1956) 74 WN (NSW) 168 at 169 per Street CJ.  
       
      
    71    Secondly, strictly the issue does not turn on a comparison between what money the plaintiff would have earned apart from the injury and what money the plaintiff will earn after the injury. The compensable loss is not a loss of income but the loss of capacity to earn income in a manner productive of financial loss: Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347. The income earned before the injury is relevant, but only as an evidentiary aid in assessing damages for the loss of capacity to earn income: Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 566 per Windeyer J. Evaluation of the worth of a loss of capacity to earn - of a lost chance to earn - is of its nature a more imprecise inquiry than calculation of a lost income. It rests on the hypothesis - that the plaintiff will have undiminished capacity - which has been rendered false by events. It does not depend on calculating the income from a particular career which is no longer possible, but in calculating the damage to a capacity to carry on various careers. It is an exercise in estimation of possibilities, not proof of probabilities. Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death, 3rd ed, para [1.9.18], said: 
     
      
       
        
        “it is not necessary for the plaintiff to establish the future loss with the same degree of precision as the present and past loss … The court is really being asked to estimate as best it can the future effect of the injuries from which the plaintiff has been proved to be suffering as a result of the defendant’s wrongful act.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd 
       (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 639 Brennan and Dawson JJ said: “the ascertainment of earning capacity involves an evaluation of possibilities, not establishing a fact as a matter of history.” They approved Lord Diplock’s statement in  
      Mallett v McMonagle 
       [1970] AC 166 at 176: “in assessing damages which depend upon its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing would or could have happened and reflect those chances, whether or not they are more or less than even, in the amount of damages …”. The majority (Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) in  
      Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd 
       said at 643 that when the law takes account of future or hypothetical events in assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring in a range from just above the speculative to just below the certain. The inquiry - the process of estimation of possibilities - is thus an imprecise and indeterminate one to be carried out within very broad parameters. The trier of fact may have to form conclusions on “slender materials”:  
      Callaghan v Wm C Lynch Pty Ltd 
       [1962] NSWR 871 at 877 per Evatt CJ, Herron and Sugerman JJ. That language, unlike the reference to permitting “guess work or speculation” elsewhere in that judgment, was not criticised in  
      Ivkovic v Australian Iron & Steel Ltd 
       [1963] SR (NSW) 598 at 607 per Manning J. However, Menzies J said that sometimes the assessment of damages involves “guess work rather than estimation”:  
      Jones v Schiffman 
       (1971) 124 CLR 303 at 308; see also  
      Linsell v Robson 
       [1976] 1 NSWLR 249 at 259 per Mahoney JA;  
      Chaplin v Hicks 
       [1911] 2 KB 786 at 792 per Vaughan Williams LJ. Lord Diplock described the factors underlying the assessment of damages for diminished earning capacity as “matters of prophecy or judicial guesses” in  
      Paul v Rendell 
       (1981) 34 ALR 569 at 578. The English position was summarised thus by Lloyd LJ in  
      Foster v Tyne and Wear County Council 
       [1986] 1 All ER 567 at 570: 
       
       
        
        “when it comes to estimating loss of earning capacity, there is no such thing as a conventional approach; there is no rule of thumb which can be applied. It would be so much easier if there were. But there is not. In each case the trial judge has to do his best to assess the plaintiff’s handicap, as an existing disability, by reference to what may happen in the future. As has been said so often, that is necessarily a matter of speculation; it is necessarily a matter of weighing up risks and chances in all the circumstances of a particular case. The very fact that the approach must necessarily be so speculative means, of course, that the occasions on which this court will feel justified in interfering with a judge’s assessment will be few and far between, for there is no established range or standard against which to measure the judge’s award.”  
         
        
       
      
    72    Thirdly, the mere fact that the quantum of damages is difficult to assess does not mean that the plaintiff is only entitled to a nominal sum. This principle applies as much to the assessment of damages for impaired earning capacity in injured plaintiffs as it does to pecuniary loss caused by negligent advice (Bowen v Blair [1933] VLR 398) or to loss in the form of the diminished value of damaged property (Wheeler v Riverside Coal Transport Co Pty Ltd [1964] Qd R 113), or equitable damages (Talbot v General Television Corporation Pty Ltd [1980] VR 224 at 250-1), or damages for breach of contract (Fink v Fink (1946) 74 CLR 127 at 143). In the last case, Dixon and McTiernan JJ put the following general proposition: “Where there has been an actual loss of some sort, the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money to defeat the only remedy it provided for breach of contract, an award of damages.” This was followed in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL (1994) 185 CLR 332 at 349 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The same is true in tort. In Naylor v Yorkshire Electricity Board [1968] AC 529 at 548 Lord Devlin said: “in the law of damages … difficulty in calculation is not ordinarily taken as a ground either for reducing or for increasing the award”. The court will be more ready to shoulder the burden of acting without specific evidence where that evidence is difficult to call. In Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 at 438, a sale of goods case involving a recovery in respect of damaged goods, Devlin J said: “It is only that where precise evidence is obtainable the Court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not the Court must do the best it can”. As McPherson J said in Nilon v Bezzina [1988] 2 Qd R 420 at 424: “The degree of precision with which damages are to be proved is proportionate to the proof reasonably available”. The courts on occasion cite in related contexts Bowen LJ’s related but stricter observation in Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 532-3, an injurious falsehood case: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all actions … on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on … in … proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done.” 
        
       
      
    73    The application of these principles is illustrated in a category of cases where the injury to a plaintiff who had the chance of a relatively high income if an appropriate tertiary training had been undertaken has prevented that training. In this category in particular the courts have not declined to make substantial awards to compensate for impaired economic capacity measured by valuing the lost chance to earn high income even though there was no evidence of the possible ranges of income. 
     
      
    74    In Ashford v Ashford (1970) 44 ALJR 195 at 196, a case where there was no evidence of particular income levels which would have been attained but for the injury and which could be attained after it, but where it was clear that there had been a diminution in earning capacity, Barwick CJ said for reasons including “the difficulty in determining what was the actual diminution of the appellant’s earning capacity, the margins within which a trial judge might properly exercise his discretion in arriving at a verdict in this case were necessarily fairly wide.” The High Court restored a verdict of the trial judge of $90,000 general damages, which evidently included $25,000 for impaired earning capacity. 
     
      
    75    In Graham v Fogarty (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 452 the plaintiff suffered serious brain damage at the age of 16. She was awarded $20,000 general damages. The report refers to no specific evidence of what her earnings would have been but for the injury and what they would have been after it. The Court of Appeal said at 453-4: 
     
      
       
        
        “If by reason of her injuries the appellant does not marry, then the economic significance of her seriously diminished capacity to work in a gainful occupation, on which she would have to depend, will be considerable. If, by reason of an unsatisfactory marriage, she has to resort to employment to support herself, again it will be significant.” 
        
       
       
      The Court of Appeal increased the general damages component to $30,000. It did so notwithstanding the want of specific evidence on earning prospects.  
       
      
    76    In National Instruments Pty Ltd v Gilles (1975) 49 ALJR 349 at 350 the High Court declined to interfere with a trial judge’s assessment of general damages (including damages for loss of earning capacity) in relation to injuries suffered by a law student. Barwick CJ said that the plaintiff’s disabilities affected the possibilities open to him for employment and promotion, and the extent of his success in private practice: 
     
      
       
        
        “No evidence was necessary, in my opinion, to enable the trial judge to place a figure upon the reasonable compensation to be awarded for this deprivation. It would not be necessary to have specific evidence as to the earnings of a solicitor conducting his own practice or of a solicitor in any or all of the employments to which I have referred. That a solicitor being in private practice or in employment is able to earn a considerable income is part of that knowledge which a juryman can be expected to have and to employ in arriving at a verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge was, in my opinion, quite at liberty to decide that there would be a considerable drop in the income which the respondent might derive from being a solicitor, whether employed or in private practice. He was entitled, in my opinion, to decide that the respondent would suffer a considerable loss in relation to income at a considerable level, whatever its particular amount might be. For this purpose, he had no need, in my opinion, to know or to have evidence of the specific earnings of a solicitor in private practice, or for that matter as to the precise level of those earnings.” 
        
       
       
      
    77    Thus the trier of fact is not constrained by narrow limitations even though it is not entitled, without evidence, to assume a specific figure for what could have been earned without the injury. Thus in Hayman v Forbes (1975) 13 SASR 225 the trial judge assumed that the plaintiff would lose “the difference between the income of a professional man and a man in a modest employment - probably, on average, not less than $20,000 gross per annum over his working life of 40 years or so.” Making various allowances for contingencies, he assessed $100,000 as damages in relation to future economic loss for a school boy who had wanted to become a veterinary scientist but after the injury could only work in a clerical capacity. The Full Court held that there was no evidence to support the $20,000 differential and it was not a matter of which judicial notice could be taken. They held that the course adopted by the trial judge was erroneous and substituted for the figure of $100,000 the figure of $75,000. For that figure they gave no reasons. Zelling J merely said at 236: 
     
      
       
        
        “the Court should do the best it can with the materials before it to assess the damages. In my opinion $75,000 is the greatest sum which could properly be regarded as appropriate in this case for damages for economic loss.” 
        
       
       
      The point is that despite the want of specific evidence, the Full Court awarded very substantial damages. The case is similar to  
      Kettley v Roulstone 
       (1961) 34 ALJR 495, where the High Court ordered a new trial because of a very high award of general damages. The award could only have been supported if evidence that the plaintiff would have earned £2,000 per annum as a carpenter in partnership with his brother could have been regarded as sufficient to justify a calculation of that degree of precision. But the High Court did not dispute that some sum for loss of earning capacity was recoverable, despite the “sketchy” nature of the evidence.  
       
      
    78    In Wade v Allsopp (1976) 10 ALR 363 the plaintiff suffered a brain injury at the age of 17. Before the injury he had been likely to matriculate into a science or economics faculty at a university. He gave evidence that he desired to study science or economics. He had a “strong and positive personality”, and a “rugged constitution combined with ambition”. Stephen J (Gibbs, Jacobs and Murphy JJ concurring) said at 359: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was considerations of this nature that called for evaluation so that the plaintiff might be compensated for the loss of the chance of attaining the relatively high economic status which might have been open to him but for his injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        The learned trial judge did not, I think, value, and reflect in his award of damages, this lost chance of attaining the financial rewards which might follow the completion of tertiary education …”. 
        
       
       
      The High Court held that the trial judge had erred in treating the plaintiff as having been likely to follow the path of his elder brother and an acquaintance through their Higher School Certificate examinations into the office of clerk in the Commonwealth public service. The High Court held that since the plaintiff was better equipped intellectually than the other two young men, there was no evidentiary basis for equating his pre-accident earning capacity with their capacity. Stephen J said at 359-360: 
       
       
        
         “To treat the plaintiff as if, despite all evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion, he would not have undertaken tertiary education and reaped the subsequent financial benefit of it is not, I think, properly to evaluate the chance of substantial earning capacity lost through the accident. No doubt there was a possibility that the plaintiff might have faired worse in life than had his brother but, while acknowledging the need to give way to this possibility, the task of assessment cannot be satisfied by what must appear to be a quite arbitrary selection of the brother’s earning capacity at the date of the trial as a measure of what would have been, but for the accident, the plaintiff’s likely earning capacity.” 
        
       
       
      The point is that no specific evidence was called as to what the income levels of university graduates in science or economics were, and no complaint was made of this by any of the justices. The result was that the Court of Appeal’s increase in the trial judge’s award of $73,978.88 (which was made up of $45,000 for impaired earning capacity, $20,000 for general damages and $8,978.88 for special damages) to $100,000 was upheld, in part because of the error as to impaired capacity and in part because of the disproportion of the low figure for general damages.  
       
      
    79    There is a related category of case where a person with a particular skill is compensated for a loss of the opportunity to develop it in a way which would have brought improved financial outcomes notwithstanding the absence of evidence as to what persons successfully exploiting those skills earn.  
     
      
    80    In Hall v Wheeler [1962] QWN 40 the court valued a chance lost by a plaintiff whose pre-accident capacity to work in his occupation as butcher was unimpaired but who was a skilful ballroom dancer. The lost chance was the chance to win ballroom championships and thereafter establish a part-time career as a dancing teacher. There was apparently no evidence of the earnings of part-time ballroom dancing teachers.  
     
      
    81    In Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 188-9 the Full Court upheld a verdict which included £1,000 for the loss of a chance that the plaintiff, a bricklayer by occupation but with a background of success as an amateur cyclist, would have been able to develop a career as a professional. It did so despite the rejection of inadmissible evidence, and the absence of admissible evidence, showing what the rewards of professional cyclists were. 
     
      
    82    A similar case was Mulvaine v Joseph (1968) 112 Sol Jo 927, where an American professional golfer injured in Europe was awarded £1,000. It was awarded for loss of opportunity to compete in tournaments, and hence a loss of experience and prestige which might have resulted in him becoming a tournament professional in America, and also for the loss of a chance of winning prize money. Thompson J said that that “figure was bound to be speculative”. There was apparently no evidence of what the earnings of a tournament professional might be, and what the prize monies might be.  
     
      
    83    Another category exists where the plaintiff, who has been carrying on a particular business, has been prevented from exploiting the opportunity of expanding it. In Szittner v Harriott [1967] 1 NSWR 233 at 237, an injury to one partner in a business caused one of the shops through which it was conducted to be sold and a planned expansion of the number of shops to be halted. The Court of Appeal, speaking through Jacobs JA, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The jury] were considering loss of future earning capacity and it does not seem to us that it is appropriate to look for precise evidence of how much profits would be lost or whether the business would make profits, or not. It would be proper for a jury to take account of the fact, or the chance, that the business would not make profits; that they might make profits for a while and then economic conditions might change. This would be all part of the chances which a jury has to take into account in estimating what is the value of the chances which have been lost. When it comes to a case of a business in this way, it is very much a question for the jury.  
        
       
       
        
        We have been referred to passages and authorities which would seem to suggest that a jury has to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that future events would occur, that a business would expand, that profits would be made. We do not think that this is a correct approach when dealing with losses of chances … [In] our view the test is that the plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for a loss of the chance and the extent of the compensation depends on the degree of the chance.” 
        
       
       
      
    84    An illustration of the court’s readiness to award damages for diminution of earning capacity arises when very young children are injured. Strictly speaking it would be impossible to prove that the child would have had an earning capacity as an adult or would have exploited it. But it is conventional to rely on the occupations, attitude to life and work histories of parents and other relatives: Kalo v Bristol Omnibus Co Ltd [1975] 1 WLR 1054; Gowling v Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co Ltd (1980) 24 SASR 321; Bullock v Miller (1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-128; Burford v Allan (1992) 60 SASR 428. See also the position in England described in McGregor on Damages, 16th ed., paras 1381-1382.  
     
      
    85    Further, the willingness of the courts to compensate plaintiffs for reduced earning capacity in the absence of specific evidence is highlighted by their willingness to compensate even where there was an increase in the post-injury but pre-trial earnings of the plaintiff which was prima facie contra-indicative of loss. In Russell v J Hargreaves & Sons Pty Ltd (1956) 30 ALJ 533 at 534 Dixon CJ and McTiernan J increased the trial judge’s award and said of the plaintiff in this position: 
     
      
       
        
        “His efficiency as a driver and his capacity to drive for any lengthy period have obviously been greatly impaired and even if an exact sum of special damages has not been proved the existence of this head of damage has been shown as a substantial element and ought to have been taken into account in assessing general damages.” 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    86    It is true that in some cases the courts have supplemented exiguous evidence by resort to judicial notice. The courts have inferred that rates in private employment are not lower than in public employment. Thus in Dessent v Commonwealth of Australia (1977) 13 ALR 437 Mason and Aickin JJ were prepared to assume that the earnings of a carpenter in civilian life would be not less than those of the plaintiff carpenter while in the Royal Australian Air Force, ie $100 per week net, and said: “it would be reasonable to assess the appellant’s loss of earning capacity at not less than 25 percent of his full capacity, that is $25 per week …”. In Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 187 Stable J thought it “notorious that an unskilled man does not overall get the same economic rewards as a skilled man. Were it otherwise, then why bother acquiring a skill at all?” He upheld a verdict of which one ingredient was $500 for loss resulting from incapacity to work as a bricklayer despite the lack of evidence of the difference in earnings. But in many instances substantial damages have been assessed for impaired earning capacity despite an absence of evidence about earnings and an inability to take judicial notice of them.  
     
      
    87    In short, where earning capacity has unquestionably been reduced but its extent is difficult to assess, even though no precise evidence of relevant earning rates is tendered, it is not open to the court to abandon the task and the want of evidence does not necessarily result in non-recovery of damages. Statements to the contrary such as those made in Allen v Loadsman [1975] 2 NSWLR 787 at 792 are not correct: Baird v Roberts [1977] 2 NSWLR 389 at 397-8 per Mahoney JA; J K Keally v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 732-735 per Moffitt P; Yammine v Kalwy [1979] 2 NSWLR 151 at 154-5 and 156-7 per Reynolds JA and Mahoney JA; Thiess Properties Pty Ltd v Page (1980) 31 ALR 430; see also Radakovic v R G Cram & Sons Pty Ltd [1975] 2 NSWLR 751 at 761 where Samuels JA criticised the “meagre facts” provided but did not say it was not open to the jury to find a substantial sum for diminished earning capacity by the “application of their own knowledge and experience”. The task of the trier of fact is to form a discretionary judgment by reference to not wholly determinate criteria within fairly wide parameters. Though the trier of fact in arriving at the discretionary judgment must achieve satisfaction that a fair award is being made, since what is involved is not the finding of historical facts on a balance of probabilities, but the assessment of the value of a chance, it is appropriate to take into account a range of possible outcomes even though the likelihood of any particular outcome being achieved may be no more than a real possibility. The trial judge in substance explained these aspects of the jury’s task satisfactorily.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 : The summing up 
      
    88    The trial judge correctly reminded the jury of the difficulties of their task. He spoke of the assessment of “what would have been her earning capacity during life but for the accident” as “a very vague exercise”. He said the jury had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the sum claimed by the plaintiff was a fair and reasonable sum. He also said that if the jury found it not possible in relation to future earning capacity to arrive at “a sensible and fair and good decision simply on a mere balance of probabilities”, it was permissible “to look at the odds, look at the proportion, look at the possibilities”. He warned that though what he was saying might sound “a bit woolly”, “the whole task is rather woolly”. On the other hand, he warned that speculation was to be avoided. He said that the jury, like judges sitting alone, had to do their best and could not refuse to reach a conclusion. He also reminded them that the assessment of future economic loss involved a double exercise in prophesy: prophesying not only what the future held for the plaintiff, but also what it would have held for her had she not been injured. He stressed that the inquiry was into lost “capacity to earn”.  
     
      
    89    The judge made the following more specific remarks about the earning capacity which the particular plaintiff had lost. He said that because she had been injured before her full-time working life had started, “prophesying what the future would hold for her if she had not been injured and what would have been her earning capacity is very difficult”. He said: “Everybody says this is a lady who has got bags of guts, and who has gone back to work as quick as she could”. She came from a very hard working family. Before the accident she had a part-time job in Year 10. She was keen to be a hairdresser and “would have liked to have built it up and had her own business”. He said that the jury might think she was “obviously going to go all out to make a good result of her life”. He said: “so it may well be that you would have little doubt coming to the conclusion that more likely than not, if she did not have the accident, she would have done her apprenticeship and gone on to run a business”. He said: “you may well, having seen her and heard her, be left in no doubt that she was a lady who would have made the most of her earning capacity for the rest of her life, as you would expect, using your commonsense knowledge, of the girl’s upbringing”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately, and I am not being critical of this, because you never get a case of perfection, you do not really have the figures of what people earn in hairdressing salons, but you have got the agreed figure that the average weekly earnings nett for a lady these days is $500 a week and it is on that basis that counsel for the plaintiff, who has given you the figures of what she has been earning since 1990 and up to date, said ‘well compare that with what she would have earned had she been a hairdresser and take the example of the average female’. 
        
       
       
        
        That is the area where the commonsense and experience of a juror, and particularly four jurors, is terribly important, because you have the benefit of this written submission, the aide prepared by counsel for the plaintiff, as to what it is hoped the plaintiff will recover. You have also got the benefit of the final address from counsel for the defendant who picks on parts of it and says ‘dear dear dear no, it is not that much for these reasons’. 
        
       
       
        
        So in respect of loss of earning capacity, you have got to use your commonsense and that is the reason why I always enjoy having juries.” 
        
       
      
    90    He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you reach the situation where you find it is not really possible say in relation to her future earning capacity on the evidence you have got to make a sensible and fair and good decision simply on a mere balance of probabilities, it is permissible to start looking at the odds and say: ‘Well, on one view of it but for the accident we have no doubt she would have gone on to be a hairdresser and run a good business and probably would have earned a darn sight more than $500. 
        
       
       
        
        In another case with another plaintiff, you might say the plaintiff had Buckley’s chance of doing what she might have even had a genuine desire to do. You may come back in a case like this to looking at future economic loss if applying just a mere balance of probabilities does not seem real to you, to look at the odds, look at the proportion, look at the possibilities and reflect that in the final sum you arrive at for loss of earning capacity in the future.” 
        
       
      
    91    None of what the trial judge said in the respects described above would appear to have been erroneous either in fact or in law.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 considered 
      
    92    It was open to the jury to “recognise that those who assume the risks of private enterprise are apt to exact higher rewards” (quoting Glass JA in Gilles v National Instruments Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, unreported, 24 September 1974). It was open to them to conclude that those who undergo apprenticeships and training are apt to exact higher rewards, as Stable J suggested in Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 187. A jury could also infer that some hairdressing businesses earn for their proprietors much more than $500 per week, even if many may earn little more than that, and some may earn less than that. That there are expensive establishments which have been in existence for substantial periods is a matter of daily observation: those establishments run high risks through high rents, and must achieve high returns. The question is not what the average or mean earnings of hairdresser business proprietors are. The question is what fair compensation would be for a person whose character, appearance, experience and family background combine to make it extremely likely that she would have succeeded in running a hairdressing business and would have gone “all out to make a good result of her life” in the financial sense as well as in other senses. While many hairdressing businesses might not be particularly lucrative, the odds were good that a person with the plaintiff’s characteristics would have enjoyed success to the extent of at least $100 per week more than average weekly earnings. Even after the physical and mental scarring of the accident, the plaintiff retained much drive - ceasing work only just before the birth of her children, returning soon after, achieving good examination results despite not attending school, entering the work force, and participating, on and off the field, in sporting activities to the extent to which her injuries permitted.  
     
      
    93    So far as the defendant appears to characterise Ground 4 as a “no evidence” point it appears to be misconceived. While there was no evidence of the earnings of hairdressing business proprietors, there was evidence of average weekly earnings, which, the court was told, includes those earnings. The jury could conclude as a matter of common experience that there was a likelihood that some proprietors of hairdressing businesses would earn more than average weekly earnings. The task on which the jury was engaged was of its nature “foggy”, to use the expression of Moffitt P in J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 735, and “woolly”, to use the expression employed by the trial judge in his summing up. The task was to value a lost chance. It is relatively easy to value a chance where a plaintiff has been employed in an occupation at a particular rate of income and after the injury cannot continue in that occupation but can in a lower paid one. In those circumstances the courts commonly look for a measure of particularity both in the pre-injury income and in any increase in it which the plaintiff contends would have been likely but for the injury and in the post-injury income: Stauffer v Hanley (NSW Court of Appeal, 6 April 1978, unreported). Even there the courts may act on evidence which is less than satisfactory. Thus in Chelini v Northern Territory Port Authority (1976) 12 ALR 519 the High Court increased a verdict one element of which was $30,000 for general damages by a further $20,000. Though the case was “riddled with unpredictables” and the “material … as to economic loss was minimal”, being limited to wages which the defendant paid the plaintiff before the accident and would have paid the plaintiff after the accident if employed in another role, the High Court increased the verdict despite the “paucity of the material as to economic loss”. It is much harder to value a chance where, as here, the plaintiff was a school child and the source of income lost is a professional business, not income from labour which is governed by awards or capable of establishment by reference to market rates. But since the obligation to value it cannot be shirked, deficiencies in the materials advanced may be tolerated. In this appeal the defendant contended that the absence of evidence about the earnings of hairdressing business proprietors was significant, because it would have been easy to call such evidence. That may be questioned. Though there may be persons who commonly value such businesses, or officers of hairdressing trade associations, and though it may be that persons in either class could assemble the evidence of what the proprietors of hairdressing businesses earn, it has not in fact been demonstrated that any people in these categories exist, or that it would be easy or feasible to prepare appropriate evidence. Nor has it been demonstrated that that evidence would not have thrown up a similar pattern of complexity to that alluded to by Moffitt P in J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 734-5 so far as barristers are concerned, namely so great a variety of non-standard instances that it would be difficult for the jury to handle.  
     
      
    94    The defendant presented its argument on Ground 4 as facing an obstacle created by Pt 51 r 23 of the Supreme Court Rules, and as resting on a failure by its own counsel at the trial to seek an appropriate direction or re-direction. This misstates the problem. The only direction or re-direction which would have corresponded with Ground 4 would have been that entailed in a request by the defendant to the trial judge to forbid the plaintiff to address along the lines of paragraph 3(b) of the plaintiff’s Schedule. If that request had been made, it would not have been right to accede to it, because while the absence of evidence about the earnings of self-employed hairdressers may have weakened the plaintiff’s contention, it did not of itself preclude acceptance of the plaintiff’s contention. The only appropriate request would have been a request that the jury be warned about the danger of taking the precise figure of $100 per week without exercising caution. In substance the jury was given that warning. The defendant did not ask the trial judge to forbid the plaintiff to address along the lines of paragraph 3(b). The defendant cannot now place itself in a better position as a result of not having made that request than it would have been in if it had made that request.  
     
      
    95    If, on the other hand, the defendant’s characterisation on appeal of its counsel’s conduct at trial is correct, Ground 4 faces a different difficulty. Below the defendant contended for nil recovery in relation to future economic loss, but it apparently did not contend that there was no evidence in relation to that component of it which was represented by $100 per week more than average weekly earnings, and it did not ask for a direction in that respect. There was no evidence as to why it did not. The position is similar to that put by Hutley JA in Linsell v Robson [1976] 1 NSWLR 249 at 252: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the trial was conducted on the basis that there was sufficient material to enable the judge to give a substantial sum for diminution of earning capacity, in my opinion it is not appropriate for any issue of this nature to be raised in this Court in this case. …” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    96    In my judgment Ground 4 is not made out.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
      
    97    The defendant’s submission to this Court was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here  
        no 
         basis in the respondent’s particular circumstances was posited for departure from the usual deduction, particularly not downwards. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent is married with two young children. She was employed at the date of trial in her father’s business doing part-time clerical work without set [hours] … This at least suggests that her working life would involve some interruption for child minding as is the modern norm. An upwards variation of the 15%  
        might 
         have been permissible, but certainly not any downwards one.” 
        
       
      
    98    The position of the defendant was thus that it was not seeking a discount higher than 15% (though one might have been permissible); it was contending only that a discount of 10% was wrong. At the hearing the position of the defendant was more qualified. It conceded that “the jury may have been entitled, on a proper direction, to return ten percent.”  
     
      
    99    I agree with Mason P that the trial judge’s summing up in relation to discounting for vicissitudes was too brief to make clear to the jury what matters had to be weighed.  
     
      
    100    To order a retrial on this ground would be a wrong course. The costs in time, money and otherwise would not produce any benefit in view of the relatively limited amount of money involved. In my judgment the jury, properly directed, would probably have selected the 10% figure. This Court, in arriving at the decision for itself, should adopt that figure. While 15% is the starting point, and, indeed, as the figure used in most cases, usually the finishing point as well, it can be departed from in an appropriate case. The drive, energy and determination of the plaintiff and her family are such that she is much likelier than most plaintiffs to overcome the vicissitudes of life and exploit what remained of her earning capacity to an extent reflected better by a 10% discount rate than a 15% discount rate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 
      
    101    The defendant contended that the trial judge ought not to have allowed the parties to give to the jury the Schedules they did. The plaintiff accepted that it would have been wrong for the trial judge to have allowed a schedule to go to the jury without consent, but that the course adopted was permissible with consent, and that there was a practice “that by consent both parties put their submissions to the jury”.  
     
      
    102    Both Schedules were useful in marking out the boundaries of each side’s contentions, which depended in some degree on specific quantities, periods, rates, service charges and multipliers. It would have been virtually impossible for the jurors to have retained these details in their heads, and not particularly easy for the jurors to have noted them down coherently. The plaintiff’s Schedule, unlike the defendant’s, had in addition a persuasive function. The plaintiff’s word “submissions” applied much more to her Schedule than to the defendant’s Schedule. In some cases particular difficulties may arise where a jury both hears oral submissions and reads written submissions, but no particular difficulty was suggested here.  
     
      
    103    The utility and innocuousness of the Schedules in this case point strongly against any error in what the trial Judge did. The question of what should be done where one side objects or where the documents are misleading may be left for a case that raises them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 
       
      The circumstances relating to Ground 9 are set out by Mason P. Though in my understanding Ground 9 was pressed to the end of the argument, the defendant conceded that by itself this ground would not justify appellate intervention, while submitting that it was part of the totality of circumstances suggesting that the trial had miscarried. I agree with the concession and disagree with the submission.  
       
       
      Ground 10 
      
    104    By “Ground 10” is meant a sentence appearing after Ground 9 which is not numbered but is to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in directing the jury ‘I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you’.” 
        
       
      
    105    No oral argument was advanced in support of this ground, though the passage complained of was relied on in support of Grounds 1-3. The written argument was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “By suggesting to the jury that they ought to accept the figures given to them …, his Honour usurped the function of the jury, and also became an additional advocate for the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    106    Read literally and by themselves, the words complained of are open to criticism. But read in context, it is clear that the trial judge was making it plain that the figures referred to were the totals reflecting a particular weekly wage loss: “What you have to take into account in your verdict is the present lump sum value of so much a week.” He was not directing the jury that it must accept the wage loss totals submitted by the plaintiff. He was leaving it open to the jury to choose what particular weekly wage loss they thought appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
        
      
    107    I would dismiss the appeal. I would order the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR:1 Andrew Schofield was working at Gosford Railway Station in the early hours of the morning of 12 March 2004 as a senior transit officer. Sometime after 3.30am two brothers, Sebastian and Christian Whitbread arrived at the station intending to travel by train to Wyong. Both had consumed copious quantities of alcohol. As each arrived at the station he was still husbanding a last bottle of Bacardi mix. 2 As events turned out their consumption of alcohol, coupled with their drunken behaviour would have consequences impacting on their lives and the lives of others for several years following. 3 Their time at this station ended shortly after 4pm when Andrew Schofield and other Transit officers manhandled each, removing each brother from the station in circumstances I shall come to. Each complained to the police who took them into their custody at the behest of the Transit officers believing each had been arrested by the Transit officers. 4 The police charged Andrew Schofield and five other Transit officers with assault of each youth. The hearing of these matters before His Honour Magistrate Miszalski appears to have been a cause celebre in the Gosford Local Court, taking eleven days to finalise.5 His Honour dismissed the charges of assault against the other co-accused. His Honour convicted Andrew Schofield of both counts of common assault. For reasons not made clear to me the appeal has been moved out of the Gosford district. It comes before me sitting at the Downing Centre District Court. This Court in determining this appeal has before it the relevant depositions and exhibits that were before his Honour. 6 The Court’s task is to review the evidence before the Local Court hearing the matter de nova that means, I am required to make my own findings of fact upon the evidence before the Local Court. I am required to form my own view as to whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each count.What the Crown Must Prove: 7 The Crown will do this if it is satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements of the charge, or put in layman’s terms the fundamental propositions contained in the charge sheets. It does not have to prove every adverse fact beyond reasonable doubt, what it must prove beyond reasonable doubt are a limited number of propositions: the date 12 March 2004; the alleged perpetrator Andrew Schofield, the appellant; the criminal act, the assault; and the victim in respect of count one Sebastian Whitbread, and in respect of count two Christian Whitbread.  
    8 An assault occurs when the perpetrator intentionally or recklessly commits an act, which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. In this case, the prosecution says the act was a physical aggressive battery committed upon each without the consent of the either. In the case of each of the Whitbread youths there is undisputed evidence that the appellant intentionally committed an act, to use neutral term, aggressively manhandling of each, which caused each to apprehend immediate violence.The Defence Thesis: 9 The defence has sought to argue, however, that the violence was not unlawful. The defence case is that the acts were either lawful for one of two reasons of believed necessity by the appellant. The acts were believed necessary by the appellant for self defence, a proposition which the Crown must negative, or alternatively, or as well, the acts constituted a lawful removal of each from railway property in accordance with the provisions of regulation 58of the Railway Safety (General) Regulation 2003. The final possibility was that the acts constituted a lawful citizen’s arrest pursuant to s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The burden of proving each of these lawful justifications rests with the defence on the balance of probabilities. The Legal Issues Defined: 10 Section 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence, if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self defence. A person carries out conduct in self defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary to defend himself, or to prevent criminal trespass to any land, or to remove a person from committing any such criminal trespass; and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceives them. Was there a lawful arrest?11 An arrest is the lawful seizing or apprehension of a subject, placing restraint upon his liberty for a purpose related to the administration of criminal justice. Such purpose may include presenting the subject before a lawful authority so that the person may be charged with an offence it is said he has committed. The parties agree the only power of arrest the appellant was able to exercise is the power provided at the relevant time by s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. 12 The parties agree Transit Officers are not constables or special constables. However, s352(1)(a) provided that a person may without warrant apprehend any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed an offence punishable on summary conviction under any Act. The Act required the person who carried out the arrest to take the person arrested and property found on him before an authorised justice to be dealt with according to law. An authorised justice is a Magistrate or justice employed in the Department of Courts Administration. 13 It is clear from the Interpretation Act 1987 that the term “Act” does not embrace “statutory instruments” see s20, s65 and s67 of also s100 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. I note s352 was repealed on 1 December 2005. 14 I have not been referred to any other power of arrest available to Transit Officers prior to 1 December 2005. As presently advised it does not appear to me the appellant had any power to arrest a person committing or immediately after having committed an offence on summary conviction under any other statutory instrument and in particular the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003. 15 Counsel for the appellant in written submissions argued that s95 of the Rail Safety Act 2002 allows for the making of regulations to create offences, that the offences so created provided they fall into subject constraints revealed by s 95(a) to s95(o) are offences created under the Rail Safety Act and therefore captured as relevant offences under s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The argument goes that being so captured the powers of arrest created by s352(1)(a) apply. 16 However, the crucial issue is the mechanism by which the manner of punishment is determined that is, whether the offence is to be punishable on indictment or summarily. In this case, the mechanism by which that punishment is determined is by the penalty imposed see; s6(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act. By virtue of the maximum penalty being five penalty units, an offender would fall within the definition of a summary offender. 17 The Common Law powers of arrest on the other hand appear to be limited to cases where treason or felony have actually been committed or attempted, or there is a danger of such offences being committed, or a breach of peace had actually been committed, or is reasonably apprehended. A breach of the peace is sufficient to justify arrest when there is an actual assault, public alarm and incitement are created by the offender’s wrongful act, or when a person obstructs a public officer in the execution of his duty. Mere annoyance, disturbance, insult or abuse of language, even of great heat and fury, without personal violence are not sufficient generally to establish breach of the peace. Nobody has sought to argue that the Transit Officers are relevantly a public officer. 18 While it is true a servant may have authority to arrest on behalf of his master it is generally limited to cases where the arrest is reasonably necessary for the protection of the master’s property. Neither of the parties has been relying on the Common Law power of arrest. 19 The Rail Safety (General) Regulations 2003 created offences appear to be from regulation 13 through to 38 and include in regulation 13, for instance, conduct generally; regulation 15 smoking; regulation 17 drinking and alcohol generally prohibited; regulation 18 passengers who are intoxicated. 20 Regulation 39 gives to an authorised officer a power to direct a person to leave a train, railway land or part of monorail works in the event that the authorised officer comes to a view someone is committing an offence under this Part, meaning between regulation 13 and regulation 21. Regulation 58 gives to an authorised officer a power to remove from a train or land a person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the Rail Safety (General) Regulation. Part 3 of the regulation relates to conduct on trains and railways. 21 Each of the clauses 13 to 38 creates at least one offence, some clauses create two offences. Offences range from drinking alcohol, use of offensive language, smoking, intoxication, hindering another’s use of a facility and so on. That is to say there is a limited range of circumstances in which an authorised person or authority can direct a person to leave railway property. 22 Clauses 18 and clause 39 empower authorised officers to direct persons to leave railway property. If circumstances permit the authorised personnel should indicate the offence or offences, which in his or her opinion a person is committing, whereby the authorised person is authorised to direct the offender to leave. 23 Where such circumstances do exist it seems to me a direction formulated simply as, “You are not allowed to be here”, (the witness, Singh, 22 August 2005 p46, line 55), or “I’m giving you a direct order to leave the station,” (the appellant Schofield, 19 July 2005, p13, line 39) is inadequate. The Evidence: 24 The evidence establishes that Christian and Sebastian Whitbread arrived at Gosford Railway Station together. They had been drinking since at least 8pm perhaps earlier. They were still drinking their last drink at 3.30am the following morning. They were asked to and did, in fact, leave the station to finish this drink. At some point shortly thereafter they returned. They were asked by a Transit Officer for a ticket. When it was discovered neither had a ticket they were told to purchase one from a nearby ticket vending machine. 25 At least one of the youths protested loudly and in language that was unseemly and on occasions offensive. This conversation was not on the station platform proper but rather on a concrete ramp leading from the station platform to Showground Road. 26 There is no doubt the youths were on railway property and quite possibly that property is adequately described as “the station”. 27 At the outset of the incident the Court is concerned with the group comprised Christian and Sebastian Whitbread and six Transit officers. At this point in time Transit Officer Sanderson was directing the two youths to leave the station. Whether the direction was given pursuant to clause 18 or clause 39 or both is unclear, because I am satisfied Sanderson did not give a reason. I am satisfied Sebastian Whitbread was using offensive language, behaving offensively and under the influence of intoxicating liquor. I am also satisfied Christian Whitbread was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and generally supportive of his brother. But at this point in time I am not satisfied he was using offensive language or behaving offensively. 28 The appellant, who had dealt with the two brothers some minutes earlier, returned after having a cigarette. The evidence is that he heard Sebastian Whitbread refusing a direct order to leave the station. The appellant’s evidence is that Sebastian Whitbread said, “I’m not fucking leaving; you’ll have to make me leave; I'm catching the Wyong train.” The appellant’s evidence is Sebastian said, “I’ve just been released from Lithgow Prison and I know my rights.” 29 The evidence establishes Sebastian had been to prison, but never to Lithgow, and he had not been “Just released,” but had been out for some months. Further, an analysis of the sentence demonstrates it to be a non sequitur. I have serious reservations about whether Sebastian Whitbread ever owned up to being at Lithgow Prison. I accept he may well have said, “I know my rights.” 30 When the appellant joined this group, on his evidence he said, “I thought you blokes had given me assurances that you would behave yourselves. I am giving you a direct order to leave the station.” That order was apparently on the basis that Sebastian Whitbread was continuing to abuse Sanderson, that is, behaving in an offensive manner. 31 The appellant’s evidence is Sebastian Whitbread said, “I will kill you cunts if you try.” The appellant’s evidence is, it is the uttering of these words that caused him to approach Sebastian Whitbread and take hold of him. The appellant says Sebastian resisted, his shirt gave way and ripped, and he wrestled him to the ground. It was during this struggle that Christian Whitbread ran towards him in a threatening manner. The appellant says, he took hold of him and got him to the ground. During that struggle Christian Whitbread abused him, spat in his direction at his face and dug his fingernails into the appellant’s right calf muscle so that the appellant felt pain.32 Elsewhere in his evidence the appellant says Sebastian Whitbread was extremely abusive, threatening, intoxicated and he did not know whether Sebastian was carrying weapons or on drugs. Elsewhere the appellant says:“I wanted to restrain his [Sebastian’s] movement. I came in with a right hand grabbed his collar area and intended to come around with my left hand behind his back to completely restrain his movements; therefore he could not use his knees or anything else...he resisted immediately and that’s how his, I mean, if I had got an open hand, how did I rip his shirt. I mean, his shirt has been ripped from the collar.” 33 It is noteworthy the appellant said in respect of Sebastian:“I was trying to bring my right hand onto his collar and the bottom part of my right hand was on his collar bone, I had hold of him there, I was bringing his left arm in. This was just a removal. There was no intention to go any further. However, by coming in close and tight like this I was prepared for this bloke to react violently, because he was ready to go and from what he’d said there was the grey area.” 34. As to Christian, the appellant said:“I would not take any risk with that fellow, because he was in total support of his brother. He would have run through a brick wall for him...They were both fairly juiced up. I can’t recall what was being said, but I found them to be intimidating, aggressive and there was a possibility of being assaulted.”35 At this point it is worth pausing to note all of the actions of the parties have been recorded on CCTV. While it is possible to observe that conversation is taking place there is no audio sound. 36 So there is the oral evidence of the conversation and the body language of the participants that give some insight into the conversation. The CCTV, of course, clearly exposes the actions of all of the parties involved. 37 The CCTV and the oral evidence appear to establish that in the moments leading up to the manhandling incident, Christian Whitbread was passive, taking little or no part in the conversation, but standing with his brother as Sebastian did most of the talking. I am of the view the reason for requiring Christian to leave the station has to be a different reason to the reason requiring Sebastian to leave. Yet that difference does not appear to have articulated by anyone when they were required to leave.38 Secondly, the body language of Sebastian in the moments prior to him being manhandled does not appear to be consistent with the threatening conversation alleged against him. Nor does the body language of those surrounding Sebastian appear to be consistent with a threat being uttered in the moments prior to the appellant handling him. It is clear from the appellant’s body language that he is gesticulating in a direction behind Christopher towards the CCTV camera 32. Yet when in the process of removing the men, the removal heads in a direction away from the camera. 39 I have now looked at that portion of the video a second time, and in fairness, there is seconds before the gesture in the direction of the camera, a gesture with the left hand in a direction opposite to the camera. 40 When Sebastian responds, he also gestures towards the camera. Then he drops both his hands down in a relaxed motion as though his hands were at rest one each side of his body. At this point there appears to be no conversation. The appellant’s hands are also hanging by his side. That in a sense was unusual, because for most of the time he was visible on the CCTV the appellant’s arms had been folded. Sebastian takes a half step backwards away from the appellant towards Transit Officer John Borcher who is standing with both arms folded across his chest behind Sebastian. Melchor Jaminez is resting his back against the glass wall. Christopher Sanderson stands about one and a half metres in front of Sebastian. He too has his arms folded across his chest resting on his stomach. Geoffrey Blight stands to the left of John Borcher, his hands appear to be hanging loosely by his sides. Reilly, the security guard, and Transit Officer Sinha are a metre and a half or so away from Christian Whitbread, they appear to be relaxed. 41 There are two Transit officers off camera behind Christian Whitbread who from time to time appear to be chatting to each other when they are captured by the camera. Christian Whitbread has his left arm hanging loosely and his right arm bent at right angles, but his elbow in against his side. 42 In the instant before the appellant lunges, the only person captured in the CCTV number 32 frame at seven minutes fifty five seconds, who appears to be stressed, is the appellant. In my view, such a scenario is entirely inconsistent with the sense of confrontation painted by the appellant on his evidence. 43 When Sebastian Whitbread moved the half step back the appellant almost immediately moved suddenly towards him, raising both arms towards Sebastian’s shoulders, one each side of the neck. In the CCTV footage from camera 32 it’s impossible to observe the appellant’s left hand. I should indicate that I have relied on camera 29 to come to a view that both hands were raised by the appellant when he approached Sebastian. The appellant’s right hand travels along the top of Sebastian’s left shoulder towards his left ear. Whether it grabs the left ear lobe, or applies pressure to a pressure point in the neck region immediately below the earlobe, is impossible to tell from the picture frames. 44 Sebastian is turned to his left through 30 to 40 degrees. The appellant moves in so that his chest is abutting Sebastian’s right shoulder. Sebastian’s head is now tilted backwards from the perpendicular some 15 or 20 degrees by the force of the appellant’s hand against Sebastian’s jaw line or pressure point. Sebastian’s left arm is grabbing the appellant’s right wrist area as though trying to release such grip or pressure as the appellant has on him. 45 I am satisfied the appellant’s right arm is making contact with Sebastian somewhere around the earlobe, upper neck region, although the nature of that contact I cannot determine specifically. Jaminez, Sanderson, Reilly, Christian and Blight have not reacted. Borcher is moving towards Sebastian. As best I can tell the appellant thrusts or pushes Sebastian with both hands downwards and against the glass wall. By this time the left side of Sebastian’s shirt is torn, revealing part of his left torso. My view is that any tearing occurred as a consequence of whatever the Appellant's left hand was doing. Borcher and another person, probably Jaminez, scoop up or try to scoop up Sebastian. The appellant is now a metre and a half from Sebastian. The appellant is on his feet standing erect. Sebastian is doubled over and is in or almost in the custody of the two other Transit Officers. 46 I am satisfied the pushing of Sebastian away has significance. If the appellant was truly fearful of Sebastian’s threat to kill or his possible possession of weapons, it is unlikely he would have pushed Sebastian free, even if only for a second, but crowded him as he earlier had, giving Sebastian no chance to reach for the weapon or otherwise advance his threat to kill. Nor is anything said to any of the other Transit Officers so far as I can tell about the threat to kill or the possible presence of a weapon. Whatever the appellant was doing, it was not about smothering a threat to kill or being alarmed about the potential for the presentation of a weapon. 47 Regulation 58 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003 permits an authorised officer to remove any person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the regulation. I am prepared to accept that the appellant genuinely believed he had given an authorised direction. However, only reasonable force can be used for such a purpose. Further, the use of force would need to be a reasonable option in all of the circumstances. The circumstances that were occurring at about 4am were these: 
     
      
     Minimal public traffic in the region; 
      
     This is not a case where any member of the public was endangered by the behaviour of Sebastian or his brother; 
      
     So far as I can tell the only people to interact with the brothers were the Transit Officers who at all times outnumbered the brothers; 
      
     Neither brother was presenting any danger by the way in which he was behaving; 
      
     Sebastian certainly was rowdy and offensive at least towards the Transit Officers; 
      
     The police had not been called; 
      
     Nor was any threat made by the Transit officers to call police if the men failed to comply with the directions; 
      
     No infringement notice had been issued; and 
      
     No attempt to escort either brother from the station had been made. 
    48 I am satisfied the use of force at the time the appellant grabbed Sebastian was not a reasonable option in all the circumstances. It is to be remembered the onus is on the defence to prove it was a reasonable option. Even if I be wrong in that assessment I am satisfied the use of force was far in excess of the force required to effect a removal. Again, the onus is on the defence to prove that the force was reasonable in all the circumstances. Further, I am satisfied there was no warrant for the appellant to approach Sebastian by way of self defence. At that stage Sebastian was outnumbered by eight or nine to two - assuming his brother was willing to assist him. It should be clear I do not regard the appellant as seeking to effect an arrest. Nor in my view was there any power to arrest him in the circumstances. 49 It follows that the appellant intentionally committed an act, which caused Sebastian Whitbread to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. I find the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant assaulted Sebastian Whitbread. 50 The position in respect of Christian Whitbread is different. At the point where the appellant had pushed Sebastian towards the glass wall he stepped back. His assault upon Sebastian was at this point over. Sebastian was then in, or almost in the custody of two other officers who were in the process of securing him with a view to removing him from the railway station. For a brief moment Sebastian did break free and sought to approach the appellant in an aggressive way. But that situation plays little part in Christian Whitbread’s conduct. 51 To the point where his brother was assaulted by the appellant Christian Whitbread had been relatively passive. However, once the appellant disengaged from his actions with Sebastian, Christian Whitbread approached him. I have no doubt he was complaining about the way in which his elder brother had been treated by the appellant. 52 While he did not run but rather stepped forward one, or perhaps two steps, he was gesticulating with his right arm at about shoulder height. True, his hand was not in a fist, but that would not have taken long to accomplish. All this was being done while he was in what the appellant described as his “personal space.” 53 The appellant, no doubt, well knew that Christian Whitbread was upset by what had happened, and was happening to his brother and blamed the appellant for it. The appellant had every reason to fear an assault upon him by Christian Whitbread. The appellant responded by placing each of his hands on Christian’s arms gripping the left arm at Christian’s elbow and moving towards the right elbow. The appellant swung Christian around and slid his hand under Christian’s left armpit and would, it seems to me, have escorted him from the railway station had not other matters intervened. In my view, there was nothing untoward or inappropriate about the appellant’s response at that point in time. 54 Sanderson began to move towards Christian. The other officers were crowding in seeking to secure Christian. At this point Sebastian’s left hand is reaching towards the appellant. The Transit Officers thereafter removed both men from the railway station. 55 It is to be remembered the appellant cannot be expected to weigh with jeweller’s scales all the issues one might think of with hindsight. The force he first tried to use was appropriate. The escalation occurred because of the acts of Christian Whitbread. I regard the acts of the appellant, in respect of Christian Whitbread’s acts and movements, done in self defence. 56 Thereafter the acts of the other Transit officers were done pursuant to a removal presumably in accordance with cl58. I am not concerned with whether the force used in that removal was excessive. The parties agree that the incident I am focusing on is the incident occurring on the ramp way to the Showground Road captured by camera 32. 57 My formal findings are these: 
     
     I find the appellant guilty of common assault of Sebastian Whitbread.  
      
     I find the prosecution has failed to prove the appellant was guilty of assaulting Christian Whitbread. What do you seek to do now, Mr Doyle? 
    Submissions made:58 HIS HONOUR: My own view of it, is that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of a s10 discharge. The finding of guilt will have significant consequences upon him. He has for thirty years been associated with those in society, primarily here, but also for a while in New Zealand, who are least likely to comply with the requirements of observing peace and behaving lawfully. It would seem that he has done his job well. 59 At four in the morning on 12 March 2004 for whatever reason, he appears to have had a brain explosion. It appears to me entirely out of character. It will have significant consequences for him. He has fought tooth and nail to establish that he behaved lawfully. He has been unsuccessful at least in respect of one charge although he has succeeded in respect of the other. 60 It may well have been a different situation had the Magistrate convicted him only of the one, rather than the two offences. My own view is that the Magistrate would not have been out of order to fine him, but the justice that I would seek to administer would also seek to pay some regard to the tremendous contribution that he has made to the society by taking on work that is difficult, stressful and sometimes dangerous. 61 I am satisfied he made a very bad error of judgment on this night but I intend to discharge him without conviction. 62 The formal orders I make are these: 
     
     The conviction recorded by the learned Magistrate in respect of Christian Whitbread is quashed. The  
      
     Finding of guilt recorded by the learned Magistrate in the matter of Sebastian Whitbread is confirmed, however, the conviction is quashed.  
      
     Pursuant to s10 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      I discharge the appellant from conviction.

59,2764866,New South Wales Crime Commission v Gibbs [2014] NSWSC 1383,"Judgment

1By summons filed on 23 September 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Stephen Allan Gibbs. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 27 and other orders. 

2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 25 September 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations) and authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.

3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.

4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Rooty Hill, a motor cycle and funds held in an account with Newcastle Permanent Building Society.

5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Gibbs had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

6Mr Spark provided a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts sheet prepared by Senior Constable Salvador of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Gibbs' arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Senior Constable Salvador about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, RMS and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by Newcastle Permanent. 

7This material disclosed that Mr Gibbs has been charged with offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 after an investigation into the cultivation of cannabis sativa plants. Police surveillance resulted in Mr Gibbs' arrest in June 2014 at the Rooty Hill property which had been converted for the purpose of growing cannabis sativa plants by enhanced means, using hydroponic cultivation. Three hundred and forty seven plants at various growing stages, with a value estimated to be of $1,735,000, were found in the property.

8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of motor vehicles and funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Gibbs is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 

9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 

10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the other orders sought. 

11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 

Orders

12I accordingly make orders in the terms sought.

61,2764847,New South Wales Crime Commission v Maxwell [2014] NSWSC 1382,"Judgment
1By summons of 23 September 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) ('the Act') in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Leigh Wayne Maxwell. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 27. 
2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 23 September 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director, Financial Investigations and authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.
3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Wilton and another located at Berridale, of which the defendant is a joint tenant, as well as funds held in an account held in ING Direct and a share held in Maxwell Investments (Aust) Pty Ltd.
5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Maxwell had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 
6Mr Spark gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts Sheet prepared by Detective Piggott of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Maxell's arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Detective Piggott about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, ASIC and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by ING. 
7This material disclosed that Mr Maxwell has been charged with offences under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act after an investigation into the involvement of a co-accused in the supply of drugs. Police surveillance recorded Mr Maxwell and his co-accused discussing cannabis ordered by Mr Maxwell and on later arrest, bags containing cannabis totalling 20 pounds were found in the boot of his car, together with other items of interest, mobile phones and cash. After arrest, Mr Maxwell made admissions to police as to the purchase of the cannabis for some $58,000 and provided a signed witness statement. Further investigations resulted in the discovery of other cannabis and large amounts of cash.
8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Maxwell is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 
9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 
10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought. 
11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 
12Given that Mr Maxwell is but one of the joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties, I take the view that the orders which I propose to make should also be served upon the other joint tenants of the two properties and that they, too, should be given liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice. In coming to that view, I have had regard to their rights under s 10C of the Act.
Orders
13I accordingly make orders in the terms sought and also order and direct that:(1)The orders be served on the other joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties.
(2)They have liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice.
(3)That a copy of these reasons be served with the orders.

62,2763475,NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2014] NSWSC 278,"JUDGMENT

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed in May 2010. On 13 May 2010, Buddin J made ex parte orders pursuant to s 10A and other provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) restraining all of the interests in property of the first defendant Jason Lee being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that he had engaged in serious crime related activity. 

2In June 2012 orders were sought under s 27 of the Act against the fourth defendant, Seong Won lee. On 19 June, Hidden J made an order s 10A restraining all of the interests in property of the fourth defendant.

3Consent orders were made in September 2012 under s 10B, for the reasonable legal expenses of the two defendants, in relation to a number of specified matters. 

4A further consent order was made in June 2013 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal in relation to their conviction for drug supply and firearm offences. 

5A further consent order under s 10B was made in November 2013 in respect of their reasonable legal expenses incurred in respect of these proceedings, that order was varied by consent in December 2013.

6A further consent order was made in January 2014 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for the High Court appeal. 

7On 14 March 2014, the parties asked the Court to make further consent orders varying these earlier consent orders, by inserting in schedule two to the orders, two further properties located at Chifley and Waterloo. That was explained for the plaintiff to reflect that these properties have now been sold, realizing proceeds which are available for payment of legal expenses still outstanding in relation to the matters the subject to the earlier consent orders. 

8Having considered the circumstances in which the parties seek the making of the proposed further consent order and the terms of that order I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's powers be exercised to make orders in the terms agreed. 

9For those reasons, I made orders in terms of the consent orders filed on 14 March 2014.

REASONS FOR JU3GMENT 

This  appeal  from  the  conviction  for  murder of  James  Edward 
of  the  Northern 

Albert  Little,  the  appellant,  in  the  Supreme  Court 
Territory Gas heard  by  this  Court on  21 August 1985 at  Darwln. 

The appellant  was  represented  by  counsel  at  the  crial,  but 

appeared in person to argue  his  case  on  this  appeal.  However,  counsel 
sought  to  appear  a s   amlcus  c-urlae  and  arrangements  were  made for  the 
appellant  to  confer  with  counsel  before  the  commencement  of  the 
hearing of  this  appeal.  We  are  much  indebte6 to counsel  who  appeared 
as  amicus  curiae  for  his  assistance  to  the  appellant  and  to  this
--------
Court.  After  courisel 

had  completed  his  submissions  as amicus  curiae 

. 

2 .  

the  appellant  said  that he did  not  wish  to  say  anything  himself  to  the 
Court  and  was  content to adopt  the  submissions of counsel. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  argument  the  Court  disrnlssed  the 

appeal  and  announced that its  reasons  would  be  published  later.  These 
are  the  reasons  which  led  me  to  join 

in the  dismissal of  the  appeal. 

The  trial  commenced  in  Darwin  on  Tuesday,  4  DecemSer 1984. 

During that day  seven  Crown  witnesses  had  given  their  evidence  and  an 
eighth  had  completed  his evidence-in-chief.  '&-en  the  trial  resumed on 
Wednesday, 5  December,  counsel  for  the  appellant  applied  to  the  trial 
Judge in the  absence  of  the  Jury for  the  discharge of the  Jury.  The 
basis of  the  application  was an article  which  appeared  that  morning  as 
headline  news  on  the  front  page  cf  the  ""Midweek  Territorian"", 
a 
newspaper  havlng  a wide  clrculation  in  Darwin  and  its  envlrons.  The 
article  contained  a  number 
inaccurate  and  prejudicial  to  the  accused  and  to  seriously  impair  hls 
prospects  cf a fair  trial. 

of  statements  which  were  said  to  be 

The  statements  to  which  exception was taken  ace  as  follows: 

the  following  statement  in  the 

f x s t   paragraph  of  the 

(a) 
article: 

..  . 

+ 

""A  man confessed  to  police  that 
traveller  in  the  back  near  Daly  Watsrs,  the 
Supreme  Court  yesterday."" 

he  had  shot  a 
N.T.
--------
the  third  paragraph  of  the  article  stated  that  the  appellant 

(b) 
""had  confessed to Darwin  Police two days  after  the shooting"". 

after  a  reference  to  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  woken  up 

(C) 
after  daylight  and  there  was  a  car  nearby,  the  artlcle  stated  that  the 
appellant  ""went  to  hls  bike  and  some 

of his  possesslons  were  misslng"". 

the  sixteenth  paragraph  of  the  arlccle  then  purported  to 

(d) 
state  the  precise  words of  the  appellant In  relation  to  the  shooting 
namely, ""I couldn't  remember how It happened ... I just  remember I hac! 
the rifle, he had his back  to  me  and I shot  hlm  a  couple  of times"". 

The  trial  Judge  declined 

CO  discharge  the  Jury  after 

considerable discussion  had  taken  place  about  the  matter  between  Bench 
and  Bar.  The  Jury  was  then  recalled  and  hls  Honour explxned to  them 
why  the  trial  had  been  Interrupted.  He drew  thezr  acEsntion to some 
of  the  statements  to which  exceptlon  had  been  taken. He told  the  Jury 
in essence  that  each  of  the  statements  was  not an accurate  account of 
what had  occurred  In Cou-t the  previous  day  and he told  the  Jury wh17 
each  scatement  was  Inaccurate.  His  Honour  sal?  thar; the  artlcle  Yas 

not  very  carefully  written,  that  it  was  mislea2mg  and  contained ""a 
good  deal of mischief"".  His  Honour  then  proceeded  to  tell  the  Jurors 
that he  would  not  discharge  them,  that  they  must  put  the  article  and 
its  contents o u t   of  thelr  minds  and  judge  the facts of  the  case op. the 
evidence  before  them  and  nothing  else.
--------
The  discharge  of  juries 

is-dealt with  in  S.  371 of  the 

Criminal  Code of  the  Northern  Territorv  which  provides: 

4. 

""371(1)  When  the  trial  of

may  discharge  the ~ury. 

an  accused  person  is

of  the  court  o r   may 
ad~ourn the  trial. 

(3)  Such  an  exercise  of discretion  1 s   not 

subject  to  review by any  court."" 

The scope  and  meanlng  of  S.  371  was  not  argued  before  us. 

The  argument  as  to  the  Supreme  Court's  powers  to  dlscharge 
proceeded  on  the  assumptlon  that  the  comman 
law applied.

Applications  to  Judges  presiding  over  criminal  trials  are  not

infrequently  made  to  dlscharge  juries 
pre~udicial newspaper  reports  of  the  trial.  The  decision  to  discharge 
or  not  to  discharge a ~ury is  essentially a matter  for  the  trlal  Judge 
in  the  exercise  of his  discretion.  If  in  exercising  his  dlscretion 
not  to  discharge  the  jury  a trial  Judge  applies  wrong  principles  or 
seriously  misconceives  the  meanixg  of  the  newspaper  article  or  Its 
rlght to  a fair

The  newspaper  article  did  say 

that  there  was  a  ""Furdsr

concern  to  the  appellant  because,  although  the  Jury  had  besn  told 
the  shooting  was  attributed  to  the  accused,  there  remained  the 
important  question  of  intent  and  this  had  not  been  the sub~ect of a 
confession.  The  appellant  was  concerned  that  the  Jury  might  forn  the 
impression that  the  record  of  Interview  to  be  tendered  amounted  to a, 
confession of  murder.-  The  -trial Judge  did  tell  the  Jury  that  m a

submitted  that,  although  his  Honour  instructed  the  Jury  that  under 
31  they  should  consider  that  the  discharge  of  the  rifle  occurred

the  rifle  was  intended  or  foreseen  by  the  appellant.  This  argument 
gas based on sub-S.  31(1)  of  the  Crimlnal  Code  which  providss: 

S. 

A  person  is  excused  from  crininal 

""31(1) 
responsibility  for  an act, omission or  event  unless 
it  was  intended  or  foreseen  by  him  as  a posslble 
consequence  of his  conduct."" 

The  words  ""act""  and  ""event"" are  defined 

by S.  1 of  the 

Criminal  Code as follows:- 

""'act',  in  relation  to an accused  person,  means  the 
deed  alleged  to  have  been  done  by  him:  it  is  not 
limited  to  bodily  movement  and  it  includes  the  deed

of  another  caused, 
done pursuant  to a common  intentlcn.
--------
'event'  means  the  result  of an act or  omission."" 

7 .  - 

Counsel  appearing  amicus  curiae  argued  that  the  definition 
""act"" in the  Criminal  Code of  the  Northern  Terrltory  is  somewhat  wider 
than  the  corresponding  definition  of  the  word  in  the  Queensland 
Criminal  Code  which  was  considered  by  the  High  Court  in  Kaporonowski 
v.  R_.  (1973) 1 A.L.R.  296. 

of 

A  reading of his  Honour's  charge  to  the  Jury 

as a whole  shows 
be 

Jury that  tney  had  to 

plainly  that  his  Honour  did  instruct  the 
satisfied  beyond  reasonable  doubt  not  only  that  the  appellant  shot  the 
vlctlm  but  also  that  he  Intended  to  kill 
hlm,  or at  least  inflict 
serious  bodily  harm  upon  him.  His  Honour  also  brought  to  the  Jury's 
attention  the  substance of  the  matters  to which S.  6  of  the  Criminal 
Code  is  directed  relating  to  the  presumption  of  normality of  mind  of 
an  accused  person  until  the  contrary  is  proved.  There  was  no 
substance  in  this  branch  of  the  appellant's  argument. 

The third  ground  of  attack on the  summlng  up  was  that  the 

crial  Judge  was  said  not  to  have  fairly  put  the  defence  case  to  the 
Jury.  It was  submitted  that  the  appellant's  case  was  put  only  brisfly 
to  the  Jury, towards  the  close  of  the  summing  up and  constituted  a 
disproportionately  small  part of the  charge  to  the  Jury.  I carefully 
read  the  trial  Judge's  charge  to  the  Jury  and  was  satlsfied  that  there 

was  no  substance  in  this gro&d 

of  attack. 

The final matter  relled on on behalf  of  the  appellant  has  Its 

genesis  in  a  sentence  of a charge to the  Jury  where  hls  Honour  said
--------
.... 

8. 

that  the  evidence  was  that  the  victim  had  been  shot  three  times  by 
projectiles  that  came  from  the  appellant's  rifle.  it  was 
smmitted 
that  this  statement  to  the 
on two 
grounds:  first, in that  it was  said  to  have  been put  by his Hor?our  to 
the  Jury as an established  fact  yet  that  was  a  matter  essentially  for 
the  Jury  to  decide  and;  second,  because  his  Honour was  sald to have 
rnlsconceived  the  effect  of  the  expert  balllstic  evidence  adduced  in 
the  Crown case. 

Jury constituted  a  misdirection 

The  trial  Judge  commenced  his  charge  to  the  Jury  by saying 
a 
that  one  of  the  objects  to  be  achieved 
summary  or  review of,the evidence  for  the  Jury  and of  the  submlsslons 
of counsel  with  respect  to  that  evidence  ""in  the  hope  that  It  will 
assist you in  arriving  at a  verdict  when you retire"".  A  little  later 
hls  Honour  said  to  the  Jury:- 

by  his  summing  up  was  to  nake 

""On the other  hand, your  function 1s to decide  the 
facts of the case,  and  just as I am the sole  judge 
of the  law, then  you are  the  sole  judges  of  che 
facts.  That's your  exclusive  province  aEd  it  is 
not  one  wit  less important  than  ny function.  And 
so,  you  being  the  sole  judges  of the  facts, it's 
not  for  me to control  or  influence  you  in  any  way 
in  your  decision  on those  facts,  and I  tell you 
now,  that if  in the  course  of  what I have  to  say tc 
you, I  appear  to  hold  or  express  any  view  of  the 
facts,  which  does  not  accord  witin your  own view, 
then you must  reject  it  out of hand. 
Whatever 2 may  say a s   to  the  effect  of  the  evidence 
is not  intended,  in any way, to  over-rlde  your  own 
j    udgmen    t 
Whatever  you may  think  is  my 
view of  the  faccs, 
bear in mind that the  ultimate  determination of  the 
facts is  entirely  for  you.  That's  your  exclusive 
province.

9. 

Then, towards  the  end  of  his summing up,  soon  after  making 
le  statement  challenged  on  this  branch  of  the  appellant's  argument. 
is Honour  referred  to  the  ballistic  evidence  and  reminded  the  Jury 
,mt a witness, Dr. Lee, had  said  that he recovered three bullet  bases 
nd  some  bullet  fragments  from  the  victim's  body  and  they  were  later 
ibjected  to  microscopic  examination,  the  result  of  which  indlcated 
m t  they  had  been  engraved  with  similar  rifling  characteristics  to 
nose  engraved  on  projectiles  which  had  been  fired  from  the 
Tellant's rifle  in  test  firing  procedures. 
3.y: - 

His Honour  went  on  to 

""Now.  if  you  accept  that  evidence,  and  I must  say 
it's  entirely a  matter for you, you might  conclude 
that  the  first  shot  was  fired  when  the  two  men  were 
standing  erect  and  facing  each  other,  that  the 
second  was  fired  as  the  victim  turned to stumble or 
run, and  that  the  third  was  fired  as  he  lay  on his 
back  on  the  ground ..."" 

This  ground of attack  on  the  conviction  also  failed. 

None  of  the  grounds  relied  on  by  the  appellant  to  challenge 

is conviction  were  established. 

Finally,  during  the  course  of  argument  reference  was  made  to 

of  an  interview  with  the  appellant  and 
It  appears  that  both  the  recordlng  and  the

s 57(1)(e) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed)
 
: This was an appeal against the decision of District Judge Audrey Lim when she convicted the appellant, Soh Lip Hwa (`Soh`), of an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) for employing a China national, Zhou Xi Qiu, who had entered Singapore without a valid pass. Soh was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge against the appellant read as follows: 
 
You, Soh Lip Hwa, Male/44 years, NRIC No. S2584327D, are charged that you, from a day in Jan 2000 till 8th day of March 2000, at various locations in Singapore, did employ one Zhou Xi Qiu [commat] Zhou Xi Qun, a China National, as general worker, whom you had reasonable grounds for believing to be a person who had acted in contravention of Section 6(1) of the Immigration Act; Chapter 133, by entering Singapore without being in possession of a Valid Pass issued by Controller of Immigration, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act Chapter 133 and punishable under Section 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 The undisputed facts 
 
 
 
 
 
On 8 March 2000, Sgt Koh Ah Seng was on patrol duty when he was despatched to Block 749, Jurong West Street 73, [num ]12-143. He saw two China nationals, namely, Huang Xin Hwa (`Huang`) and Zhou Xi Qiu (`Zhou`) working in that unit which was under renovation at that time. They were unable to produce any documents when requested and were arrested. They were subsequently charged in court and convicted for being illegal immigrants.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
Soh was employed as a supervisor in a company known as Tops and Hui Design & Renovation (`Tops and Hui`), which was owned by one Ting See Sa Moi (`Ting`), since July 1999 when the company was first set up.
Soh`s job was to supervise the workers and the factory. According to Ting, every minor detail in the factory was handled by him. Soh was in charge of the workers and arranged for the workers to do their jobs at the project sites. When there was a project, drawings would be faxed to Ting. Soh would then arrange for the workers to go to the site and do all the measurements before commencing work. Every week he would advise Ting as to how much to pay the workers and she would withdraw the money from the bank for payment. If Ting was unable to do so, Soh could also withdraw the money to pay the workers, as Soh and Ting were joint signatories to the company`s bank account.
Soh was given almost complete control over the assignments given to Ting`s company. Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s approval or consent and he had done so previously. Ting did not raise any objections to that as she thought he was more familiar with that line of work.
In 1999, Soh brought two China nationals, namely Zhou and Huang, to see Ting and asked her whether she wanted to employ them. Ting told him no, as her company was very small. When Ting asked the two China nationals whether they had work permits, Huang showed her a work permit. Zhou did not do so. Ting claimed that she could not understand the contents of the work permit as she did not know English. She testified that Soh had seen the work permit and told her that the work permit was genuine. Ting told Huang that she had no work for him at that time and that she would contact him if she had any work for him. She made a copy of Huang`s work permit.
Soh had informed Ting of a contract for cleaning works at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. Soh was in charge of the work to be done in that unit. As Ting was not free to attend to this herself, Soh told her that he would send workers to do the job, and suggested sending Huang. Ting agreed to it and told Soh he could send the person whose work permit she had photocopied to do the work. Ting testified that she did not instruct Soh to employ Zhou.
During the course of the investigations, two handphones were seized by Investigating Officer SSgt Anan s/o Balakrishnan. One of the handphones was seized from Zhou. That handphone, bearing the number 97870275, was registered in the name of Soh and the phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address.
Ting testified that she had never purchased handphones for the company and had never given any handphone to anyone in the company. She never requested Soh to purchase handphones for the company. She also did not pay for Soh`s handphone or his handphone bills. Neither did she pay for any handphones or handphone bills for the workers.
 The defence 
 
 
 
Soh testified that he was formally employed by Ting from May 2000. Prior to that, he was employed by Home Shape Design and Construction (`Home Shape`), which was a company owned by Ting`s husband, Ngu Ting Tieh (`Ngu`). Soh would assist Ting whenever Ngu instructed him to do so.
Soh`s evidence was that, as a supervisor, he had no authority to employ any workers. His main job was to oversee the production line in the factory and he never went down to project sites. He acted on Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions and it was Ting, and not him, who was in charge of the day to day running of the business in Tops and Hui. According to Soh, Ting had told him of the work to be done at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. He testified that he was not in charge of the work to be conducted in that unit and did not supervise the workers for the project. However, he testified later that he had instructed workers to go to the unit to do work upon Ngu`s or Ting`s orders.
Soh got to know Zhou and Huang at a nearby canteen. One day both of them asked him whether any general work was available. Soh told them that they could ask Ngu at Home Shape. Soh brought them to see Ting and asked her whether she would employ them. Soh said that he did not see Ting check any work permit and was not aware whether she did so. However, he later testified that Ting told him after checking the work permit that it was genuine.
Soh`s defence was that it was Tops and Hui, and not he, who had employed Zhou and that Soh had acted on Ting`s instructions in sending Zhou to do the work. Zhou contacted Ting in the office to ask if there was any job for him. Ting told Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to report for work. Ting also paid $20 to him to be handed over to Zhou as Zhou`s salary for the work to be done.
Ting told Soh to apply for two handphone lines for the use of the company two to three years prior to 2000. At that time, Ting was at Home Shape. The handphone bearing the number 97870275 was the handphone that Home Shape instructed him to purchase. He handed this handphone to Zhou. The handphone was purchased for Home Shape, but the bill was sent to his residential address. According to Soh, this was because he did not bring an authorisation letter from Home Shape when he bought the handphone, but produced his identity card instead. He handed the phone bills to Home Shape for reimbursement or payment. He never asked Ngu whether he would pay or had paid the bills.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judge accepted Ting`s testimony that she had left Soh to supervise the work at the factory and on-site and to deploy and supervise workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without Ting`s consent was also accepted by the judge.
The judge found that Soh had brought Zhou and Huang to see her for employment. It was also found that Ting had asked to look at their work permits, and Huang produced one to Soh, who remarked that it was genuine and handed it to Ting. The judge believed Ting`s testimony that she had agreed to Soh`s suggestion in deploying Huang to do the cleaning work at the flat, as Huang had a work permit. Further, it was found by the judge that Ting never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou.
The judge found that there was clear indicia of employment by Soh. Firstly, in Soh`s long statement he admitted that he had informed Zhou that there was a job for him and asked him to come to work. Soh also demonstrated the work to Zhou and told him that he could return in one or two days. When Zhou returned, Soh directed him to do the cleaning work and gave him the address. The judge preferred Soh`s evidence in his long statement to his testimony in court, where he claimed that he had done all those things on Ting`s orders. Secondly, Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day. Thirdly, Soh gave Zhou a handphone registered in Soh`s name to contact him for work. The judge also found Soh to be an inconsistent, evasive and untruthful witness. For instance, Soh`s evidence was that he did not know that Zhou and Huang produced their work permits to Ting and he did not see Ting check their work permits. However, he later testified that Ting told him that the work permits were genuine. Under such circumstances, Soh must have known that Ting had checked their work permits. Another discrepancy noted by the trial judge was that Soh testified that he did not supervise workers or go to project sites and he only worked in the factory, but he also testified that he did instruct workers to go to the unit at Blk 749 upon Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions. Yet another inconsistency was that Soh kept referring to Ting as his boss during the trial and as his employer in the long statement, but he kept denying that he was employed by Ting at the material time. He maintained that his employer was Ngu at that time, but Ngu was never mentioned in his long statement as his employer. The judge rejected Soh`s explanation that he regarded Ting as his employer when the statement was recorded, because he was then working for Ting, and thus did not mention Ngu as his boss. The judge held that it was inconceivable how Soh could have forgotten to mention Ngu, if Ngu had been involved in any way.
Accordingly the judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Soh had employed Zhou at the material time and Soh was convicted. The judge imposed a sentence of one year`s imprisonment, taking into consideration the recent decisions of 
Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP
 (Unreported) , 
Tan Soon Meng v PP
 (Unreported) and 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
 .
 The motion to adduce additional evidence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh applied, by way of CrM 24/2001, for leave to adduce the following documents as additional evidence: 
(1) a faxed copy of Zhou Xi Qiu`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to one Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(2) a faxed copy of a letter from the Singapore Immigration & Registration (SIR) dated 12 February 2000 addressed to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(3) a copy of the original letter from the SIR dated 12 February 2000 to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(4) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the marriage of Zhou Xi Qiu to Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(5) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Zhou Xi Qiu; 
(6) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Lin Ming Qin; 
(7) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 27 May 2001; 
(8) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 20 June 2001.
The applicable provision in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) is s 257(1) which reads as follows: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter, the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or a Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
The principles in determining whether additional evidence is `necessary` were laid down in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  at 343, which adopted the test in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
: 
 
[F]irst it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 
 
 
This threefold test of non-availability, relevance and reliability has been applied in the recent cases of 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
 , 
Lee Yuen Hong v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
  and 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
 .
 (1)THE EVIDENCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED WITH REASONABLE DILIGENCE FOR USE AT THE TRIAL
In my view, the first condition was satisfied. There was no evidence to suggest that Soh knew at the time of the trial that Ting had helped Zhou`s wife apply for a social visit pass. It was also reasonable for Soh not to have suspected at the time of the trial that Ting had done so, as no evidence had been adduced to show that Ting had revealed this fact to anyone prior to the trial.
Soh might have known of the application if he had managed to contact Zhou before the trial. Soh had handed Zhou a handphone so that Soh could contact him if there was any work for him. Prior to the trial, Soh had attempted to contact Zhou by calling the phone numbers in China, as reflected on the handphone bills. In my view, this amounted to the exercise of reasonable diligence, but Soh was not able to contact Zhou prior to the trial and was thus unable to obtain evidence of the application.
 (2)THE EVIDENCE MUST BE SUCH THAT, IF GIVEN, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE RESULT OF THE CASE, ALTHOUGH IT NEED NOT BE DECISIVE
Counsel for Soh submitted that the letter from the SIR addressed to Ting regarding an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife indicated a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou, and their relationship was not limited to a mere acquaintanceship that was formed when Soh brought Zhou and Huang to see Ting. It was contended that this showed that Ting had been less than truthful during the trial. It was also submitted that in such circumstances it would be more likely that Zhou would have approached Ting rather than Soh for employment and it was Ting who subsequently employed Zhou.
I was of the opinion that the evidence in this case was sufficiently strong to prove that Soh employed Zhou. Ting, being the local sponsor, was required to declare her relationship with Zhou`s wife in the form for the application for a social visit pass. No evidence was adduced as to what was the relationship that Ting declared in the form. The fact that Ting had made an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife might suggest that the relationship between Ting and Zhou was more than a mere acquaintanceship. Nevertheless, the possibility of a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou would not have an important influence on the result of the case, as it was not sufficient to show that Soh did not employ Zhou. Furthermore, the inference that Ting might have employed Zhou due to their relationship being possibly more than an acquaintanceship was not a strong one.
The other documents, namely, the faxed copy of Zhou`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to Lin Ming Qin, the notarial certificate certifying the marriage of Zhou to his wife, the notarial certificates certifying the identities of Zhou and his wife and the DHL envelopes cum shipment airway bills, would also not have an important influence on the result of the case.
Since the second condition was not satisfied, the motion should be dismissed.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
The main issue in this case was whether Soh had in fact employed Zhou. Before deciding on that issue, I dealt with defence counsel`s argument that the judge had erred in fact when she accepted Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent.
Ting testified in court that Soh had the authority to employ workers without her approval, as he was more familiar with this line. It was contended by defence counsel that as far as foreign workers were concerned, only Ting would have the authority to employ them. Counsel submitted that this was evidenced by the fact that Ting would apply for work permits for her workers through her agent and that Soh had seen it fit to bring Zhou and Huang to see Ting to ask her whether she had jobs for them and whether she wanted to employ them. It was submitted that the fact that Ting had told Huang that she had no job for him at the moment and would contact him if she had any job for him also implied that only Ting had the authority to hire foreign workers.
It is well settled that an appellate court would not readily disturb the trial judge`s finding of fact. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , it was held that: 
 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 
 
 
This principle has been applied by the Court of Appeal in several recent cases: 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ; 
Abdul Ra`uf bin Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 683
 .
In my view, this finding of fact was not reached against the weight of the evidence. Ting testified that she and Soh were joint signatories to the bank account of Tops and Hui from which Soh was able to withdraw money to pay the workers and other expenses. In addition, she stated that Soh was able to tell how much each worker was worth according to their craftsmanship and would advise her how much to pay the workers every week. In my view, these facts showed the trust that Ting had in Soh and the extent of Soh`s responsibility in Tops and Hui.
Counsel for Soh submitted that, in giving such testimony, Ting was trying to distance herself from the employment of Zhou and to shift all responsibility to Soh. However, it must be noted that Soh did not dispute the fact that he held a joint account with Ting, that he was able to withdraw money from the account to pay the workers and that he determined the salaries of the workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent was consistent with the extent of trust and responsibility conferred on Soh. Accordingly there was no reason to overturn the judge`s finding of fact in the present case.
In any event, even if the judge was wrong in finding that Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s consent, I was of the view that Soh would still be guilty of the charge if he had in fact employed Zhou, even though he had no general authority to hire workers.
 (1)WHETHER SOH EMPLOYED ZHOU ON THE FACTS OF THE PRESENT CASE
Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) (`the Act`) reads: 
 
 
(1) Any person who - 
 
(e) employs any person who has acted in contravention of section 6 (1), 15 or 36 or the regulations; 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and - 
 
(ii) subject to section (1A), in the case of an offence under paragraph (b), (d) or (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000.
  
 
 
`Employ` is defined in s 2 as: 
 
""employ"" means to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without remuneration.
 
 
 
This definition came into effect on 1 March 1996.
As I noted in 
Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 702
 , under the amended definition of `employ`, in s 2 of the Act, there was no longer a requirement that the prosecution must prove the existence of a contract of service or any payment before the alleged employer could be charged under s 57(1)(e) of the Act. In 
PP v Heng Siak Kwang
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 274
  it was held that the manner of remuneration and control over the workers would often be of great significance in deciding whether there was an employment relationship between the parties. 
 Heng Siak Kwang 
 dealt with the definition of `employ` before the amendment in 1996. Nevertheless the manner of remuneration and the degree of control of the workers continue to be two significant considerations in determining the existence of an employment relationship: 
Ramli bin Daud v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 225
 ; 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 ; 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
. However, these are not the only considerations which the court will take cognizance of when determining the existence of an employment relationship.
In the present case, there was evidence that Soh had control over Zhou. In the long statement, Soh stated as follows: 
 
A few days later,
 the male China national (Zhou) contacted me and asked me if there is any job for him. I told him that there is and asked him to come for work
 ...
 On his arrival, I demonstrated to him how to do the work. I also told him that he could come for work one or two days later
 ... After two days, the male China national (Zhou) came to the company. 
 I then gave the address of a unit and told him to go there to do the cleaning works in a taxi
. I also told him that the keys to the unit would be above the meter reading box. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In court, Soh admitted that he had made the above statement. However, Soh sought to qualify his statement by saying that Zhou called Ting in the office, and not him, and that Ting told him to inform Zhou that there was a job for Zhou and to ask him to come to work. When Soh was asked during cross-examination to explain why he had omitted to mention that it was Ting who had instructed him to ask Zhou to come to work, he claimed that he was very tense when he was in the police station.
The judge rejected Soh`s qualification, as it was never once mentioned in his long statement. She held that it was implausible for him not to mention that he had done everything on Ting`s instructions because he was very tense, since he was able to give a very detailed account of how he had met Zhou and dealt with him, and had even mentioned Ting`s name. It was also held that it was inconceivable that he could have omitted such a material fact, namely, that it was Ting and not him, who had employed Zhou, if that was indeed the case.
On appeal, defence counsel submitted that the judge was wrong in accepting Ting`s testimony that she never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou. It was also contended that the judge had erred in fact when she disbelieved Soh`s testimony at trial that all the instructions given to Zhou were upon Ting`s orders. Counsel contended that Soh`s omission to mention in his long statement that he had been acting on Ting`s instructions as regards Zhou ought not to be taken against him, as direct and specific questions such as `Who employed Zhou?` or `Did you employ Zhou? If not, who did?` were not posed to him. Counsel also submitted that Soh was very tense when the statement was taken and it was not unusual for an accused person to omit to mention certain important facts in view of the pressures faced during police investigations.
I was unable to accept this argument. As rightly held by the judge, if Ting had in fact given instructions in asking Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to come to work, it was very unlikely that Soh would omit to mention that fact, given that he had mentioned Ting earlier in the statement and given that this was an important fact. There was no need to pose specific questions to elicit this fact if Ting had indeed been involved. In my view, the judge`s finding that Ting never gave permission to employ Zhou should be upheld. I was also satisfied that the judge was not wrong in rejecting Soh`s qualification to his long statement at trial.
Apart from Soh having control over Zhou, there was other evidence which gave rise to the inference that Zhou was employed by Soh. Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day two to three times and had given Zhou a handphone registered under Soh`s name so that it would be convenient for Soh to contact him (Zhou) if there was any work. The phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address. Soh claimed that Home Shape had instructed him to purchase the handphone and that the bills were paid by Home Shape. However, no evidence was adduced to show that this was so. If the phone was indeed purchased for Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would leave the billing address as his residential address for one and a half years and not subsequently change the billing address to that of the company. Furthermore, if the bills were to be paid by Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would be so unconcerned with whether unpaid portions of certain bills or amounts that were overdue had been paid by Home Shape. It would be in his interest to see that the bills were paid since he would be personally liable if payments were not made.
Accordingly, I was satisfied that the element of employment had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 (2) MENS REA
The offence under s 57(1)(e) is not one of strict liability. The prosecution had the burden of establishing that Soh had the necessary mens rea, that is, he knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that Zhou was an immigration offender: 
Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 744
 ; 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
 (supra).
In my view, Soh had the requisite mens rea for the offence. From the evidence, Soh had gotten to know Zhou at a nearby canteen and he was aware that Zhou was a China national. There was no evidence that Soh had checked Zhou`s passport or work permit. Soh had not exercised any due diligence on Zhou`s immigration status.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh argued that the sentence of one year imposed by the court below was manifestly excessive for the following reasons: Soh had completely no part to play in Zhou`s illegal entry into Singapore; there could not have been any profit motive on the part of Soh as he was not the boss of the business; there was no evidence to suggest that Soh stood to gain or had gained any advantage in having employed Zhou; Zhou was employed only on an ad hoc basis; Soh did not give any assistance to Zhou to evade apprehension; only one immigration offender was involved; there was no ill-treatment of the person employed; Soh has no antecedents whatsoever whether of similar offences or otherwise.
Counsel for Soh also submitted that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused, the court ought to take into consideration the following mitigating factors: Soh was married with three children (ages 16, 14 and 12 years) and his wife was a housewife who was currently four months` pregnant. He had set up his own business and was holding the post of production manager. He was drawing a gross monthly salary of $5,000. Since late 1992, Soh had been diagnosed with and had been treated for chronic anxiety-depressive disorder.
In the recent case of 
 Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about two months. He was a first offender and was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. The accused unsuccessfully appealed against conviction and sentence. His sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment on appeal. In 
 Tan Soon Meng v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about six months. The accused, who had three previous convictions for illegal employment under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. He initially appealed against his conviction, but subsequently applied to withdraw his appeal. Before the court acceded to his application, his sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment.
 Tan Soon Meng 
 was affirmed in 
 Ang Jwee Herng v PP 
 (supra) in which the court reiterated that the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrant workers was now one year, double that of the previously assumed tariff of six months.
In my view, the imposition of a minimum term of six months` imprisonment as prescribed by s 57(1)(ii) of the Act was confined to cases where the accused pleaded guilty to the charge. In cases where the accused was convicted after trial, the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrants was one year`s imprisonment.
The impact of imprisonment on the offender`s family members is generally not relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out. In
 Ang Jwee Herng 
 (supra), I held at [para ]78 that: 
 
... the argument that an offender`s family members will suffer if the offender is incarcerated for a longer term is one often put forth in vain by defence counsel. The reason, as I explained in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  is simply because imprisonment of the sole breadwinner inevitably causes hardship to the family. If the courts were to take such hardship into account in determining the appropriate sentence, then any punishment meted out would not be accurately reflective of the gravity of the offence and circumstance of the offender himself, but tempered with considerations of the extent to which his family would be prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay for committing a crime is the hardship that would unavoidably be caused to the offender`s family. To put it bluntly, the appellant should have thought hard about these consequences before committing the offences in question. It is now too late in the day for him to regret the inescapable hardship which his own foolishness and greed will cause to his wife and children.
 
 
 
Accordingly, I did not think that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the sentence ordered by the district court should be affirmed.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons stated above, I denied the criminal motion and dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: On 3 March 2009 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Central Local Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: Possess a prohibited pistol not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s 7(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment. A standard non parole period of three years is applicable. 
       
       
      Count 2: Possess a firearm which was not registered, contrary to s 36(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 10 years imprisonment. There is no standard non parole period applicable to this offence. 
       
       
      He was then committed to the District Court for sentence. 
       
      
    3 On 19 June 2009 the applicant was sentenced for those offences in the District Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: A non parole period of four years six months imprisonment commencing on 24 June 2009 and expiring on 23 December 2013 with a balance of term of one year six months commencing on 24 December 2013 and expiring on 23 June 2015. 
       
       
      Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment of two years eight months commencing on 24 June 2009 and expiring on 23 February 2012. 
       
      
    4 The sentence on count 1 took into account the following offences on a Form 1: 
     
      
       
      (1) Possession of ammunition without a licence contrary to s 65(3) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996.  
       
       
      (2) Possession of a prohibited drug, 0.27 g methylamphetamine, contrary to s 10(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985.  
       
      
    5 The applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentences on the grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in commencing the sentences on 24 June 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in failing to consider the question of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in failing to make a finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentencing judge erred by not allowing a discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty before committal in accordance with s 17(1)(a) of the  
        Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    6 The facts were agreed. In essence, at approximately 3.00 am on 10 June 2008 two police officers stopped in response to traffic lights at an intersection. They observed a Subaru WRX which was also stopped in response to traffic lights at the intersection. There were four male occupants in the vehicle. The actions of the driver and passengers aroused the interest of the police who pulled the vehicle over a short distance from the lights. As his Honour recounted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Information regarding the WRX and its occupants was then broadcast over police radio and Officer O’Brien reached into the car to remove the keys from the ignition. 
        
       
       
        
        Officer O’Brien noticed all four [occupants] become extremely nervous, looking from side to side and behind them as they fidgeted and reached down between their legs with their hands. He then stepped back from the vehicle and pulled the restraining clip from his firearm, yelling ‘Keep your hands up where I can see them, stop moving around and keep your hands up. If you don’t someone is going to get hurt.’”  
        
       
      
    7 A search of the vehicle and its occupants revealed the presence of a balaclava and three white gloves. One occupant (Nguyen) had a machete with a 50 cm blade secreted in his pants. A black Parabellum pistol containing a magazine with 10 live rounds of ammunition was located in the foot well where one occupant (Chompeay) had been sitting. A 32 calibre Beretta pistol was located in the foot well area on the driver’s side where the applicant had been sitting. It contained a magazine with two live rounds of ammunition. A plastic bag containing 0.27 grams of methylamphetamine was located in his pocket. The occupant Tran had a Taser-type device, in working order, on his person and a copper coloured bullet in his pocket. A .25 calibre pistol with a magazine with six live rounds was found in the foot well area where Tran had been sitting. The pistols were prohibited and unregistered. The occupants had no licences or permits in respect of them. Numerous items of correspondence in the name of the applicant were located in the glovebox of the vehicle. 
     
      
    8 All four occupants of the vehicle were arrested. Subsequently Nguyen was deported before charges were laid against him. The applicant and the other two occupants were sentenced together.  
     
      
    9 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour, the sentencing judge, allowed a 20 percent discount for the guilty pleas. Regrettably, his Honour’s attention was not drawn to the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 which had application in this case and provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “17(1) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time before being committed for sentence, the sentencing court must allow a discount for the guilty plea calculated as follows:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term—a term that is 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed” 
        
       
      
    10 The Crown conceded that a material error had occurred in this regard. In the circumstances the sentences must be quashed and the applicant resentenced. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was born in October 1976 in Vietnam. He gave evidence on sentence that he and his family escaped as boat people from Vietnam to Malaysia where they spent time in a refugee camp. In 1982 they migrated to Australia. At age 14 he left school and was recruited into a criminal gang and adopted a life of crime. 
     
      
    12 The applicant has a wife and two young children. At the time of his arrest he was unemployed and had been for six months. In the past he had had problems with gambling and drug use. 
     
      
    13 He was examined by a psychologist, Professor Woods, who assessed him as suffering from substance abuse disorder, severe personality disturbance with paranoid features, residual symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and pathological gambling. He had seen the applicant in late 2004 and early 2005 and had commenced therapy which, he said, resulted in the applicant making excellent progress. Treatment ceased during incarceration and the applicant reported his symptoms were returning. 
     
      
    14 Professor Woods’ opinion was based largely upon a history given to him by the applicant. As the applicant was not a credible witness (see para [18] hereof), little weight can be attached to Professor Woods opinion as to the applicant’s mental state. 
     
      
    15 I have had regard in resentencing the applicant to his affidavit affirmed on 7 May 2010 in which he states he is participating in a printing traineeship, has enrolled for rehabilitation courses, is receiving treatment for his drug problems, has family support, and is determined that this will be his last time in gaol. It is to be hoped that the applicant is now on a path that will lead to his rehabilitation but the evidence is not sufficient to consider the applicant’s prospects in this regard as other than equivocal. 
     
      
    16 The applicant’s record showed that he had been convicted of a number of types of different offences including illegal use of a motor vehicle, self administer prohibited drug, break enter and steal, armed robbery, steal motor vehicle, possess firearm without licence, resist officer, enter inclosed lands, behave in an offensive manner, supply prohibited drug, possess unauthorised firearm, possess prohibited drug and goods in custody. He has served previous terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 At the time of the offence the applicant was on conditional liberty, being on parole, having been sentenced to four years imprisonment with a 15 month non parole period for drug supply, and a concurrent ten month fixed term for possession of an unauthorised firearm, with the sentences commencing on 25 June 2005. He was released to parole on 24 September 2006. As a result of the subject offences, the parole was revoked effective as of the date of his arrest, 10 June 2008, and he was ordered to serve the balance of parole of one year 15 days, which expired on 24 June 2009. 
     
      
    18 The applicant informed Professor Woods and gave evidence that he was in the process of purchasing a gun for self protection from the 5T gang, of which he had been a member. He said he and the other occupants of the vehicle had obtained the guns on credit a few hours earlier and that when stopped by the police they were on their way to borrow the funds to pay for the weapons. There is no evidence to confirm this explanation (apart from the evidence of the co-offender Mr Chompeay). The circumstances make it improbable, and I do not accept it. I am confirmed in my conclusion by the comments of the sentencing judge who had the benefit of observing the applicant give evidence on sentence and who described the applicant’s oral evidence as “trite, fanciful, unbelievable and contrary to common sense”. He totally rejected that evidence, observing that, even if it was true, it did not mitigate the seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    19 The Firearms Act 1996 s 7(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit.” 
        
       
      
    20 A prohibited firearm is defined in s 4 and means a firearm described in Sch 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. The firearms there described ranged from a machine gun, rifle, shotgun down to replica firearms. A prohibited pistol is defined in s 4C(1). 
     
      
    21 Section 7(1) refers to both possessing and using a firearm. It can be argued that using is a more serious offence than possessing and that a pistol is less dangerous than a machine gun. However, each can be lethal and a pistol may be readily concealed upon the person. Much depends upon the circumstances. 
     
      
    22 In this case the pistol was loaded and unsecured. It was in the applicant’s possession when he was a member of a group of heavily armed young men. The pistol was within a vehicle upon a public street in an urban area. It was capable of being concealed upon the applicant’s person or in the vehicle. A balaclava and gloves were in the vehicle. The pistol represented a high risk to members of the public and to the arresting police though it was not used on this occasion. There was no acceptable innocent explanation for the possession of the pistol which in any way mitigated the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    23 The objective circumstances of this offence, in my opinion, place it significantly above the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences. In these circumstances, reference to the yardstick provided by the standard non parole period is of limited assistance. The maximum penalty of 14 years thus becomes the principal factor in determining the sentence as the objective criminality is above the mid range – R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 at [37] and Micklesson v R [2009] NSWCCA 61 at [15]-[16]. 
     
      
    24 The offences were committed by the applicant in circumstances where punishment, including imprisonment for a previous similar offence, had had no rehabilitative effect upon him and the offences were committed in breach of parole. A lengthy custodial sentence is warranted for specific deterrence and protection of the community. 
     
      
    25 I have had regard to ss 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No penalty other than full time imprisonment is appropriate and no submission to the contrary was made.  
     
      
    26 The applicant is entitled to a 25 percent discount for the pleas of guilty. The subjective factors are of little assistance to the applicant. There is no acceptable evidence of remorse or contrition and I have already commented on rehabilitation. The applicant’s record is not one which entitles him to any leniency from the Court. 
     
      
    27 The doctrine of totality requires the Court to consider “the total criminality involved not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence” and to ensure that the aggregation of sentences is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved” – Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 per McHugh J at 307-308, R v Kerr [2008] NSWCCA 201 at [26]. At the time of sentence the applicant was completing a period of imprisonment following the revocation of an earlier parole. He had only a few days remaining of that sentence. The applicant was serving the earlier sentence for a serious offence of supplying the commercial quantity of heroin. The sentence for the possession of the prohibited firearm had expired well before his arrest on the subject charges. The drug offence was a serious matter and distinct from the subject offences. I do not regard it as a special circumstance which would justify reduction of the non parole period. In my opinion, there were no special circumstances. 
     
      
    28 Judicial Commission statistics and a table of cases were before the Court. However, the statistics were based upon a small number of cases. They were too limited to provide guidance as to the appropriate range particularly when dealing with an offence where the circumstances may be so variable. Similarly, I did not find the table of cases of any real assistance. 
     
      
    29 I have taken into account on count 1 the two matters on the Form 1.  
     
      
    30 In my opinion, the appropriate sentence (rounded off) on the count 1 offence is imprisonment for a non parole period of three years eleven months with a balance of term of one year four months. The penalty that would have been imposed on count 1 but for the guilty plea was seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    31 The second count relates to the same pistol. In my opinion, the appropriate sentence for this offence is a fixed term of imprisonment for two years two months, to be served concurrently with the sentence under count 1. 
     
      
    32 The sentences for counts 1 and 2 should commence on 19 June 2009, being the day on which the sentences were imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant as follows: count 1 imprisonment for a non parole period of three years eleven months to commence on 19 June 2009 and expire on 18 May 2013 and a balance of term of one year four months to expire on 18 September 2014; count 2 imprisonment for a fixed term of two years two months to commence on 19 June 2009 and expire on 18 August 2011. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 18 May 2013.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Spigelman CJ: I agree with Barr J 
      
       
     2 Barr J: The appellants, Brendan James Piggott, John Henry Griffiths and Michael Simeon appeal against their convictions in the District Court, each for the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methcathinone. Mr Piggott and Mr Simeon appeal also against their convictions for supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the same drug. All the appellants also seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  
      
       
     3 During the early part of 1999 Mr Griffiths, operating under the business name “ Solvent Solutions”, purchased chemicals and laboratory glassware from wholesale suppliers. Mr Simeon took a lease of premises, referred to at the trial as a factory unit, at Castle Hill. 
      
       
     4 On 28 and 29 June and again on 1 July 1999 the three accused visited the business premises of wholesale chemical suppliers. They travelled between the premises of those suppliers and the factory unit at Castle Hill in a motor vehicle owned by Mr Pigott. 
      
       
     5 On 29 June 1999 the police, accompanied by Mr Murtagh, a forensic analytical chemist, entered the factory unit pursuant to a search warrant. They made observations and took photographs. They took away for examination samples of materials they found there. 
      
       
     6 They visited the premises again on the following day. 
      
       
     7 On 1 July 1999, a video/audio recording was made of the activities of all three accused in the factory unit. They were the only occupants at any relevant time. The recording was continued on the following day, when only Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon were present. Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon were arrested when they emerged from the factory shortly after 9pm on 2 July 1999. Immediately preceding their arrest Mr Piggott had driven his motor vehicle out of the factory premises. He was seated in it whilst Mr Simeon was in the act of closing the roller door. On the front passenger’s side of the vehicle, a police officer found plastic bags containing a further seven smaller plastic bags, each containing powder.  
      
       
     8 It was the Crown case that the seven bags contained 979.1 grams of methcathinone. Each appellant was charged with having been knowingly concerned in its manufacture. In addition, Mr Piggott and Mr Simeon were charged with its supply, constituted by their possession of it for the purpose of supply. 
      
       
     9 On 3 July 1999 the police and Mr Murtagh searched the factory unit and its contents more thoroughly. They found a variety of chemicals and a large number of items of chemical glassware and other apparatus. From this and from the video evidence it appeared that all three accused on 1 July, and Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon on 2 July were engaged in the chemical process which resulted in the manufacture, within the meaning of that term as it is used in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, of the contents of the plastic bags. 
      
       
     10 There was also present in the factory a quantity of powder, traces of which were detected on apparatus or utensils. Video evidence indicated that a small quantity of powder, estimated by Mr Murtagh at not more than about 20 grams or so, was added by the accused to other substances, and that the whole of the resulting mixture underwent the process of washing in acetone, designed to remove impurities from it. 
      
       
     11 In washing the impurities from the substance all three accused on 1 July and Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon on 2 July were engaged in purifying it and hence were knowingly taking part in a step in the process of its manufacture. 
      
       
     12 Apart from the 20 grams to which I have referred, the 979.1 grams was not otherwise manufactured at the factory unit. The evidence did not disclose where it was manufactured in any sense other than by purification. 
      
       
     13 At the factory unit the police officers and Mr Murtagh found documents in which were recorded two versions of the same chemical recipe. Documents in essentially the same form were found in Mr Pigott’s motor car following his arrest on 2 July and a further similar version was found in Mr Simeon’s house on 3 July. These were all typewritten documents and took two forms. The first was a recipe with nineteen numbered steps, indicating a process by which some sort of chemical reaction, up to and including purification by washing in acetone, might be achieved.  
      
       
     14 The second version was to the same effect, without typewritten numbered paragraphs but in which the quantities of the substances to be used were recorded in half-measures. 
      
       
     15 In Mr Griffiths’ premises was found a published chemical abstract from a Russian source for the synthesis of methcathinone. Both versions of the recipe were substantially based upon and were derived from that abstract. 
      
       
     16 In due course the trial judge expressed himself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the typewritten documents were substantially chemical recipes for the manufacture of a prohibited drug, which was likely to be methcathinone to the knowledge of each of the accused.17 The major issue at the trial was whether the powder in the bags contained methcathinone. The first and principal ground of appeal of each appellant asserts that the verdict (or verdicts) is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Each appellant says that the quality of the evidence was such that the jury were bound to have a reasonable doubt about that ultimate fact. Accordingly, the appellants must satisfy the Court that on all the evidence it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the bags contained methcathinone and return verdicts of guilty: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.18 There were several pieces of evidence consistent with the conclusion that the bags contained methcathinone but which could not individually or collectively prove beyond reasonable doubt that they did. Examples were the recipes, the chemical abstract and the results of test done by Mr Murtagh on substances removed from the premises and showing, if accepted, the presence of methcathinone. The Crown accepted and the jury were directed that the Crown could prove the charges only by satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the reliability of the chemical analysis of the contents of the bags. Two chemical analysts, Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, gave evidence for the Crown and one, Dr Kibby, for the defence. Only Mr Ballard analysed the contents of the bags, so his evidence was critical to the proof of the Crown case. 
      
       
     19 The evidence established that there are three tests by which the chemical analysis of an unknown substance might be determined. The first is a double test called Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), the second is called Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and the third Infra-red Spectrography (IR). 
      
       
     20 In GCMS the substance it is desired to identify is dissolved and the solution is introduced into an instrument which incorporates a column whose interior surfaces are coated with material that causes different substances to move at different speeds. The solvent moves very fast and becomes separated from the other components of the solution. As each other component passes out of the instrument a computer records a peak on a graph. The size of the peak is proportionate to the amount of the substance present. An electronic detector records the time that elapses between the introduction of the solution into the instrument and the passage of the dissolved substance out of the instrument. That elapsed time is called the Retention Time. The instrument prints out what is called the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC), showing, by printing peaks on a graph, which materials have passed through the machine and their retention times.  
      
       
     21 The second function of the apparatus is called Mass Spectrometry (MS). In it the emerging substance is electronically bombarded and converted into electrically charged particles, or ions. The test results are displayed by a computer-produced series of vertical lines or peaks on a graph, showing which ions are present and in what quantities. The position on a scale of each line or peak corresponds with the molecular weight of the ion detected and its height with the relative intensity or quantity of the ion. So the testing of a given substance should produce a typical pattern. The tester can measure from the graph and calculate the intensity of other ions detected relative to the major ion, expressing the result as a percentage figure. This is called the relative ion intensity. The tester can also instruct the computer itself to make this calculation. For this purpose the tester is concerned only with the four ions next in intensity to the major ion. 
      
       
     22 In TLC the unknown substance is dissolved in a mixture of solvents designed to separate its component parts. A small quantity of solution is placed on a line at the base of a rectangular plate. The plate is treated or processed so that component substances move up the plate in the solution to new positions according to their chemical composition. The distance so moved is called the Rf value. A number of dissolved substances can be dealt with in the one test on the one plate, including solutions of substances whose chemical compositions and Rf values are known. The solvent evaporates and “spots” of the unknown and known substances are left on the plate. The positions of the spots are plotted, apparently by line of sight rather than by the instrument itself, and Rf values assigned. In this way unknown substances may be demonstrated to be identical or not identical to (as having or not having the same Rf value as) known substances. 
      
       
     23 In IR the unknown substance, which will absorb infra-red radiation, is dissolved in a solvent which will not. An instrument scans the solution and measures the rate at which radiation is absorbed. It produces its results by printing out a spectrum, which may be compared with the spectra of known substances.  
      
       
     24 Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, both chemists employed by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL), and Dr Kibby, an analytical chemist of considerable experience, agreed generally that the most reliable of the three tests was GCMS. They did not agree about the value of TLC and IR. Dr Kibby, for example, thought that TLC results were of little worth. What can be said with confidence is that TLC and IR results were treated at the trial as being capable of supporting conclusions reached by GCMS testing but not, standing alone, of proving beyond reasonable doubt the nature of the powder in the bags.  
      
       
     25 Conclusions based on the results of GCMS testing require a comparison between the result patterns of unknown substances and those of known substances. An analyst may obtain the relevant patterns of known substances in any of three ways. Ideally, the known substance will be available to the analyst for testing on the same apparatus at the same time as the unknown substance. This is called a curator’s standard. Secondly, the apparatus to be used may already have tested the known substance. The results retained in the database are called the library standard. None of the tests carried out used library standards. When a laboratory does not have a sample of a known substance for comparison the analyst has to resort to comparing the test results with results published in scientific publications. These are referred to as literature standards. The three experts said that matches with curator’s standards were preferable to literature references which, of course, require the application of human judgment and are therefore subject to human error. Even so, the AGAL manual provides that literature standards are an acceptable source for comparison. 
      
       
     26 Methcathinone has been a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act only since December 1996 and the Court was told that this trial was the first in New South Wales concerned with that drug. Although both Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard had had substantial experience as analytical chemists – Mr Murtagh had been over thirty years with AGAL and Mr Ballard had eleven years’ experience as an analytical chemist including three and a half years at AGAL – neither had analysed methcathinone before.  
      
       
     27 When Mr Murtagh began to test the substances taken from the factory unit AGAL had no curator’s standard for methcathinone. Using TLC, which he conceded as the crudest of the tests, and GCMS, Mr Murtagh concluded by visual comparison with literature standards that a number of samples contained methcathinone. He told Mr Ballard his opinion. It is unnecessary to deal here with the attacks made at trial on the reliability of these conclusions. What is important about them is that from then on Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, who not long afterwards became associated with the testing, thought or expected that the bags might contain methcathinone.  
      
       
     28 Seven samples, one from each bag, were taken by AGAL and numbered 991685 to 991691. They went to Mr Ballard for testing. On 12 July 1999 he did an IR test on them all and concluded by reference to literature standards that each was methcathinone. He conceded at the trial that further testing was necessary to confirm that conclusion. On the same day Mr Ballard carried out TLC tests on the seven samples and came to the same conclusion. However, he did not regard those results as settling the identification of methcathinone.  
      
       
     29 It was agreed between the experts that there were three factors important to the validity of an identification by GCMS, namely the retention time, the characteristic pattern of ions and the relative intensity of ions.  
      
       
     30 AGAL maintained a manual, an extract of which put into evidence as Exhibit WW. The extract comprises pages 12 and 13 of a 29-page document and the body of it is as follows - 
      
       
        
         
         7.0 GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY 
         
        
        
         
         Many of the above considerations concerning Gas Chromatography instrumentation are also applicable to GC-MS systems. 
         
        
        
         
         Autotune: 
          is an automated tuning program for general purpose MSD operation. It optimises MSD performance. In autotuning the mass number is calibrated, the mass peak resolution is adjusted as is the sensitivity or relative intensity. The data system automatically adjusts MSD parameters to meet certain predefined performance criteria. 
         
        
        
         
       Identification of Substances by GCMS 
        
       
     · Each analyst should be able to identify the MS of a substance by direct comparison to a reference spectrum and be able to determine any significant differences 
      
       
     · The MS should contain sufficient details (pattern of peaks and relative abundancies(sic)) to identify the substance by comparison to a reference spectrum. The reference spectrum should be obtained from one of (1) standard actually run on the same GCMS (2) library search reference data match (3) literature reference e.g. “Pharmaceutical Mass Spectra” The Pharmaceutical Press, London. 
      
       
     · Individual compound identification should be done by comparison with reference spectrum. Comparison may be done against the reference spectra manually or using the table of relative ion abundances. 
      
       
        
        
         
          
           
           Acceptance/rejection criteria for relative abundances of the five most significant masses: 
            
           ± 10% of the standard run on the same day on the same instrument, and or 
           
          
         
        
       
      ± 20% of reference spectra. 
      
       
     · If the MS contains several relatively abundant ions at the high mass end, comparison with the condensed library spectrum may be sufficient. For substance that contain only one or two relatively small sized ions an expanded scale spectrum should be printed and this compared with a slightly expanded spectrum run of the reference standard 
      
       
     · The retention time should be considered as certain high mass molecules may match an MS but would be unlikely to have a similar retention time to the unknown 
      
       
     · A satisfactory spectrum may be difficult to obtain for trace drug components. The spectrum may be highly indicative of a particular drug component but contain additional small peaks (instrumental background, contamination) not present in the reference spectrum. Do not eliminate a substance due to the presence of such small peaks. 
      
       
     · Condensed library spectra contain only the most significant peaks as selected by the instruments library creation algorithm. The proportion of minor peaks may vary from one analysis to another, instrument to instrument and may be affected by background and sample concentration. 
      
       
     31 On 15 July 1999 Mr Ballard carried out a GCMS test on sample 991685 and by a visual comparison with a literature standard concluded that the substance was methcathinone. He was cross-examined on the question whether the relative intensity of the ions came within the 20% tolerance provided for in the manual.  
      
       
     32 The literature standard was set out in a document which became Exhibit 158. Mr Ballard agreed that the 20% tolerance was to be calculated on the literature standard, not on the results of tests of the unknown substance. His test results were set out in a document Exhibit 157. Exhibit XX was a computer-produced calculation assigning intensities to the ions Mr Ballard’s test showed to be present. The most abundant ion in the tested and the literature samples was ion 58. The next four most abundant ions, not necessarily in decreasing order of size, were numbers 77, 51, 56 and 42. The value of 100% was assigned to ion 58 and lower percentage figures to the other ions according to their abundances relative to that of ion 58 as revealed in the test results.  
      
       
     33 Mr Ballard agreed in cross-examination that the following were the relevant intensities of ions 58, 77 and 51. In the literature standard ions 77 and 51 were present in about equal intensities and each was assigned a value relative to ion 58 of 11%. According to the manual, therefore, ions 77 and 51 of the tested unknown substance would meet the acceptance criterion if their intensity, expressed as a percentage of the intensity of ion 58, fell within the range 8.8% to 13.2%. Mr Ballard calculated the intensity of ion 77 from his results in Exhibit 157 at 23%. The computer-calculated intensity in Exhibit XX was 24.19%, exceeding the literature standard by 83%. Mr Ballard calculated the intensity of ion 51 from the results in Exhibit 157 at 28%. The computer-calculated intensity was 29.23%, exceeding the literature standard by more than 120%. There was this evidence - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. We have agreed, of course, that the only way the most intense peak in the spectrum is termed the base peak and all others are reported relative to its intensity. That is it, isn’t it? You can’t get around that, that is just not in the manual, is it, that is scientific precision? 
         
        
       
      A. That is the way of calculating the relative ion intensities, yes. 
      
       
        
        Q. Why calculate the relative ion intensities? 
        
         
         A. As I said, it is not often done. I can’t think of any occasion in the laboratory where myself or others I have worked with have actually done that. It is not procedure. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. These manuals and the NATA Service Charter aren’t all put out for mere fun, are they, is that what you are saying? 
          
         A. No, not at all. These manuals of which Exhibit WW is part are written according to the practices that we use. NATA then look at our practices, look at the manuals and their accreditation is based overall on that. But these manuals aren’t just strung up and blindly followed. These manuals are written up from what is being done. Exactly what the writer of this particular document meant by ‘comparison against the reference spectrum manually’ I can’t comment on but they would have written that with regard to what was actually done in the laboratory and what is actually done in the laboratory is a visual comparison. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Even for a substance that is unknown and not previously analysed? 
         
        
       A. I believe so, yes. 
        
        
         
         Q. Do forensic chemist have a certain magic that ordinary humans don’t? 
          
         A. I wouldn’t describe it as anything magic and, as I have previously said, there is nothing mystic about methcathinone. It is another substance like any other we analyse. We analyse it in the same manner as every other substance we receive in the laboratory. 
         
        
        
        Q. You see, WW ruins your confirmatory test, doesn’t it? 
        
         
         A. I don’t believe it ruins it, as I said these methods are dynamic. They are changed from time to time if something is found to be in need of change. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which is wrong if you accept that relative intensity of ions is not just proper but proven scientific procedure and I think we have all accepted that. Am I right? 
         
        
       
      A. I would say yes, it is proven procedure. 
      
       
        
       
     34 The references to NATA were to the National Association of Testing Authorities, an Australian body which accredits scientific institutions. 
      
       
     35 Mr Ballard said that when he tested sample 991685 he knew that the testing equipment could print out the relative ion intensities but that it was not the practice in the laboratory to do so. This question and answer followed - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Because if you had produced these results, 1685, which is Exhibit XX, there is no way, would you agree with me, that those results could stand up with what the manual says you are supposed to do, is that right? 
         
        
       
      A. According strictly to the manual, yes. 
      
       
     36 No comparison of retention times could be carried out at that stage because AGAL had no curator’s standard for methcathinone. 
      
       
     37 In view of the remarkable discrepancy between the relative ion intensities of the reference sample and the tested sample and the acceptance/rejection criterion of plus or minus 20% provided for in the manual the jury ought in my opinion to have regarded Mr Ballard’s conclusion as tentative at best.  
      
       
     38 Mr Ballard formed his conclusion by reference only to the second of the criteria, namely the appearance of the characteristic pattern of ions. Given that the relative intensity of ion 77 was almost twice as great as in the literature standard and that that for ion 51 was more that twice as great, I think that the jury ought to have wondered how firmly Mr Ballard could hold the view that the pattern appearance of the tested sample matched the literature standard. 
      
       
     39 The evidence about the AGAL manual, its status, intention and authorship, was unsatisfactory. Only two small parts of it were tendered. According to Mr Murtagh it was written by scientists for scientists to assist analysts, not to replace their skills. It was not to be read in a black and white fashion. He rejected what he called its dogmatic approach. Speaking of the tolerance margins for relative ion intensities, he made a number of statements which may not have sat well together, namely that the tolerance levels were valid, that the authors had given insufficient weight to the difference between two makes of testing instruments and that a test result falling outside the 20% margin should exclude a match technically, though it did not show that a conclusion to the contrary was wrong. He was not asked to explain what he meant by the word “technically”. 
      
       
     40 Dr Kibby said this of the manual -  
      
       
        
         
         It’s a part of the quality accreditation re laboratory. You must have adequate documentation of the procedures that you use for analytical chemistry, and these procedures and protocols are to be followed by all staff. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     41 Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard routinely regarded the manual’s statements only as guidelines. Occasionally they ignored them. An example comes from the evidence of Mr Murtagh about testing samples on 13 and 14 October 1999, by which time AGAL had the curator’s standard for methcathinone. The manual provided for runs of blanks initially and between runs of the known and unknown substances, to ensure that the results were not contaminated by material remaining from any prior run. This extract is taken from his Honour’s summing-up - 
      
       
        
         
         …  
         and (Mr Murtagh) gave in evidence that, in relation to these tests, he had not done them in accordance with the manual – “technically”, again he said – in that he had not run a standard at the end of each blank, nor had he included duplicate runs as indicated by the manual. He claims, however, that the reference to “duplicates” relates to quantitation, not identity testing, even though the manual apparently indicates otherwise. He agreed that his runs in respect of these samples, however, was “technically” deficient, because they did not comply with the manual. 
         
        
        
         
         You have heard the evidence relating to the importance of complying with these set standards and counsel’s submissions to you in relation to that, particularly from Mr Mayne, whose evidence in cross-examination I am presently dealing with, but also from Mr Fliece and Mr Bonnici. You may ask yourselves whether substantial non-compliance with these set standards, designed to produce validity in the results of an analysis, can be properly regarded as merely technical. 
         
        
       
     42 Dr Kibby took the opposite approach and submissions by the appellant at trial and in this Court based on his evidence were to the effect that a test result falling outside the tolerance margin showed that the unknown substance must be a substance other than methcathinone. Such an approach seems unreasonable to me, if only because it makes no allowance for contamination or equipment malfunction and admits no possibility that an analyst may be unsure of the identity of a tested substance . 
      
       
     43 Dr Kibby also said this - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. How important is the criteria (sic) of relative ion intensities in relation to identification of a compound which is known against a compound which is unknown please? 
          
         A. Well, it’s critical. But remember the first criteria (sic) is retention time. It’s when the retention times match that you then have to progress to the ions observed and then the relative intensities of those ions. But if the retention times don’t match, you don’t even progress to the second and third criteria. 
         
        
       
       
      
       
     44 Dealing with the diametrically opposed views of the experts, the Crown put to the jury and repeated in this Court that notwithstanding the provisions of the manual the approach of Mr Ballard and Mr Murtagh was a principled one. Referring to Mr Ballard’s identification only by ion pattern, the analogy was drawn of a person recognising a common make of motor car. It could be legitimately done in either of two ways, it was submitted, namely by looking at it and assessing the make and model by reference to the way the make and model always appeared, or by recording the number of all the component parts and comparing them with the manufacturer’s list of parts. 
      
       
     45 In my opinion the analogy is of limited value. The recognition of a motor car as of a well-known model requires at least two things to happen. First, the observer has to have seen a substantial number of cars of that model in conditions which will impress all the distinctive aspects of its profile on the memory. Secondly, the car to be identified has to be seen in conditions which enable all the distinctive aspects of its profile to be seen. It is by no means clear that the shape or chemical profile of methcathinone was known to Mr Ballard, though he had read in the literature about the ion pattern that might be expected to be seen. He had never analysed methcathinone before, even though the process of analysis was the same as for any other chemical substance. He did not see all aspects of the shape of the test samples before reaching a conclusion, but only the shape represented by the ion pattern. As the cross-examination revealed, the shape that Mr Ballard saw must have differed to some degree from the literature description. 
      
       
     46 The analogy also assumes that the observer has no expectation about the make and model of motor car about to be seen, a condition that did not exist here.  
      
       
     47 AGAL received its curator’s sample of methcathinone on 5 August 1999. On 25 August Mr Ballard did a GCMS test of each of the seven samples. Unlike Mr Murtagh, he ran a sequence of tests in accordance with the manual, comprising one blank, three standard runs, one further blank run, a first and a duplicate run on the first sample (991685) and one run for each other sample followed by a further blank and a final standard run. 
      
       
     48 Mr Ballard prepared to run GCMS tests, as he said to establish that the substance was methcathinone. Before starting them he programmed the instrument and a summary of the intended test runs was printed out. It was tendered by counsel for Mr Griffiths and became Exhibit U. 
      
       
     49 Mr Ballard’s evidence was that he keyed in the name of the substance to be tested as “methcathinone” and that he probably keyed into the instrument a retention time of 9.8 minutes. He either keyed in or left in 0.2 minutes as the maximum permissible difference in retention time. On the summary Exhibit U the retention time of 9.8 minutes and the tolerance margin, called “window”, of 0.200 minutes appear. Next to each of the samples listed in Exhibit U appear under the heading “source”, the letters “ACQU”. They are an abbreviation of “Acquisition”, an instruction to the computer to acquire data from the samples being run 
      
       
     50 The instrument took about 29 minutes to perform each run.  
      
       
     51 The form of report for each individual run had provision for printing the date and time of commencement, the name of the component and the retention time, among other things. There was no provision for showing the tolerance margin or window. There was provision for printing the word “acquire” if the computer, according to its instructions, acquired its data from samples run. Each report also incorporated a graph with a computer-produced peak. If the peak fell within the window, the computer would print “methcathinone” at the apex of the peak, but would otherwise not print the name of any substance on the graph.  
      
       
     52 The results of the first three curator’s standard tests were printed. They became Exhibits V, W and X. On each report the retention time is printed as 9.78 minutes. It was common ground that the expected retention time for methcathinone was 9.8 minutes, but it was also agreed that a difference of 0.02 minutes was insignificant. Following the next blank run the unknown samples were tested and the results printed on documents that became Exhibits S to GG. 
      
       
     53 It was agreed that the retention time for each of the seven unknown samples should not differ from the retention time for the curator’s sample by more than 0.2 minutes. There was no direct evidence as to the manual’s requirements, in that respect. No relevant portion of the manual was tendered. However, the portion of Dr Kibby’s evidence extracted above implied that the manual mandated a tolerance margin of 0.2 minutes. 
      
       
     54 The first three runs, on the curator’s standard, produced identical results, including retention times of 9.78 minutes and the printed annotations “methcathinone” on the graph. According to the reports, the first run commenced at 12 hours 13 minutes 37 seconds, the second at 12 hours 42 minutes 37 seconds and the third at 14 hours 16 minutes 21 seconds, all on 24 August 1999. The reports of the first two runs, Exhibits V and W, bore the printed word “acquire”. That of the third run, Exhibit X, bore instead the word “file”.  
      
       
     55 The report on the test of the first of the unknown samples, Exhibit Z, showed the retention time at 9.55 minutes. Surprisingly, because that time was more than 0.2 minutes less than the standard retention time, the report printed “methcathinone” at the apex of the peak. Like Exhibit X, it bore the printed word “file”, not “acquire”. Mr Ballard was cross-examined about how such things could have happened. Then there emerged a fact which had not been mentioned (or perhaps noticed, for this is not intended to be any criticism of the Crown Prosecutor) during Mr Ballard’s evidence in chief, namely that the run was recorded as having commenced at 14 hours 17 minutes 52 seconds on 24 August 1999. That was impossible if the preceding run with the standard sample(report Exhibit X) did not begin until 14 hours 16 minutes 21 seconds and took about 29 minutes. 
      
       
     56 Curiously, Mr Ballard then said that he was conducting the tests not to confirm that the substance was methcathinone but only for the purpose of quantitation. He agreed in cross-examination that the notation “methcathinone” should not have appeared on the graph in view of the difference between the retention times. Later on, he confirmed that each run took about 29 minutes. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         A. Further looking at this last night, going through them with the times, it appears that I did use the instrument some time after 12.42 and before 14.16 – 2.16 – that day. 
         
        
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Between 12.42 – is that what you said? 
       
      A. Yes, 12.42 
      
       
        
        Q. And what time? 
       
      A. And 14.16, which is the next print-out. 
      
       
        
        BONNICI: 14.42 is the last. 
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. I’m sorry, when you say you used the instrument, you mean for something else?  
          
         A. Not for something else, but I believe I had some interaction with the instrument. 
         
        
        
         
       BONNICI: Q. Exhibit W is 12.42pm, is that right? 
       
      A. That’s right. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Why would you set a sequence up the way you did and you’ve got 0.2 window and you’re only there for quantitative purposes as you say, why would you touch that sequence at all, Mr Ballard. 
         
        
       
      A. Sequences are sometimes interrupted while they’re running. 
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Sometimes interrupted? 
       
      A. While they’re running. 
      
       
         
        
        … 
        
        
         
         BONNICI: Q. If you interacted with the machine there has to be a reason for that, doesn’t there? 
         
        
       
      A. Yes. 
      
       
        
        Q. What was your reason? 
        
         
         A. I can’t remember specifically, but I am guessing it’s to, well I am assuming I had seen that the computer wasn’t selecting the peak from exhibit Z onwards as methcathinone. Having already determined that it was methcathinone in those samples, and confirmed it by the previous tests, I believe I changed the window, opened the window a little to include it. 
         
        
       
     57 The summary of the sequence of tests, Exhibit U, was printed at 11 hours 11 minutes 37 seconds, before the first run began. It must have been intended and understood to be an accurate summary of the instructions then given to the instrument for the succeeding tests. As such it was misleading because it gave the impression that the tests that followed had been run subject to a limitation that a tested substance would be designated methcathinone only if the retention time fell within 0.2 minutes of 9.8 minutes. One would have expected an amended report in the form of Exhibit U to be printed, summarising the changed test conditions and listing the samples to be tested. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Here of course the very reason you stopped the sequence in the, if we want to call it the lunch hour, and started it again, was to enlarge the window to possibly .3, certainly over .23, isn’t that right? 
          
         A. At this point I can’t say whether that’s why I stopped the sequence. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Has anyone else, would anyone interact with the machine to increase the width of the window from .2 to over .23? 
         
        
       
      A. I don’t believe so. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. The fact is that the window on exhibit U showing .2 during the lunch hour had been increased to possibly .3, hasn’t it? 
         
        
       
      A. Possibly .3, yes. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Why isn’t that documented please, so we can know the exact window that we are supposed to be looking at? 
         
        
         
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Are you saying that it was increased and it possibly could have been .3? I am not sure I fully appreciate your evidence. You are saying the window was increased? 
       
      A. It was possibly increased. 
      
       
        
        BONNICI: Q. Not possibly, definitely increased, wasn’t it? 
        
         
         A. Again, I can’t specifically recall it, but it would appear that I possibly increased the minute. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let’s forget whether you recall it or not. It’s there documented in evidence that .23 is a difference in the retention times between the curator standard and the sample 1685 to 1691. It’s in black and white on exhibit U, isn’t it not, that the window is .2, and it’s also in black and white in exhibits Z to GG that methcathinone has been printed out on the pieces of paper that have come out, without even saying who did it, the window has been increased to over .23, hadn’t it? 
         
        
        A. It would appear so, yes. 
        
        
         
         Q. And when the window is increased, it’s increased from .2 to .3 you wouldn’t be doing .25? 
         
        
       
      A. I don’t know, I can’t answer that. Maybe .3. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. If anybody changed the window, it must have been you, is that correct? 
         
        
         
       A. Yes, I’d say that’s correct. 
        
        
        Q. So where’s the record of that change? 
        
         
         A. Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be a record. It perhaps would have been more prudent of me if I had changed it, then to reprint exhibit U showing that. I think it’s just -- 
         
        
        
        Q. More prudent? 
       
      A. It would have been a lot easier now to see that that was .3, 
      
       
        
         
         Q. So from what I gather you now know definitely in the lunch hour you must have done that on 24 August 1999, am I right? 
         
        
        A. Again, I can’t say that I definitely did it, but -- 
        
        
       Q. Could be there was a virus in the computer that did it? 
        
         
         A. I can’t answer that either, but it was quite possibly me who changed it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And if you did, the only possible reason you would have done it is to ensure that on the window it appeared as the word methcathinone, isn’t that right? 
          
         A. To ensure that the area was displayed in the relevant box, the area of the peak. 
         
        
        
        … 
        
        
         
         Q. Did you change exhibit U to show that or did you – why did you not tell anyone that you had done that please? 
         
        
       
      A. Why didn’t I change exhibit U? 
      
       
        
        Q. Mm hmm. 
        
         
         A. It wasn’t a purposeful thing. I guess, I already printed it out and I already printed out the sequence out in if I had changed the window, well, I guess it was an oversight. I forgot to reprint exhibit U which is the sequence. 
         
        
       
     58 Mr Ballard’s attention was drawn to the appearance of the word “file” on Exhibits X and Z, whereas the display on the other reports was “acquire”. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Please go to Exhibit U to make it simpler for all of us. Number 1 blank, number 2 the standard, number 3 the standard, that is the ones run before12.42 pm and all have the word ‘acquire’ don’t they? 
         
        
       
      A. Yes they do on that list. All of them have the word ‘acquire’. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. But if you look after 12.42 pm, exhibits X, and Z, the word ‘acquire’ is not there, it is the word ‘file? 
          
         A. Yes that is true and if I printed them all out every single one would have the word ‘file’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you didn’t print them the following day, you printed them out between 12.42 pm and 2.17 pm on 24 August? 
         
        
         
       A. Yes I did, I thought I had made that clear. 
        
        
         
       HIS HONOUR: Q. You printed all of these out? 
        
         
         A. Exhibits X and Z I printed out, whether it was because the origins had been jammed in the printer or for some other reason I can’t now say but I reprinted those two. 
         
        
        
         
         BONNICI: Q. The only reason, Mr Ballard, is the difference, that there would be an extension of the window, there hasn’t been a paper jam, has there? 
         
        
       
      A. I can’t now recall. 
      
       
     59 There was no evidence of any paper jam. 
      
       
     60 It was put to Mr Ballard that the difference in retention time of 0.23 minutes indicated that the unknown samples did not contain methcathinone. He said that if his explanation were discounted that was a conclusion which was open. It seems to me that that was a very important concession which ought to have been given weight by the jury.  
      
       
     61 The evidence about the authority of the manual and the respect which analysts ought to have had to it was, in the circumstances I have summarised, ambiguous. The jury were not bound to accept at face value the evidence of Dr Kibby, and I have given one reason by way of example justifying a critical appraisal of it. There were others, too. Some of the results he described as “absolutely amazing”. He described the GCMS results of August 2000 as “…this rubbish proffered in evidence…”. He described test results as “dreadful” and obliquely accused the Crown experts of being biased. The jury were in the best position to assess his demeanour and these illustrations show why they might not have been inclined to place much weight on his evidence.  
      
       
     62 But even so, I do not think that the jury were entitled to treat the manual as of little or no authority and I think that they were obliged in assessing the evidence of Mr Ballard to regard as substantial the manner in which he disregarded its statements. They were obliged, I think, in view of the relative ion intensities that were ultimately shown to exist, to treat with caution Mr Ballard’s conclusion arrived at by visual comparison alone of the pattern on ions. The jury were also bound to regard what Mr Ballard described as his “interaction” with the testing apparatus, his putting forward a misleading summary of tests programmed as though they were carried out in terms and his not producing an accurate summary of tests actually done as throwing serious doubt on the integrity of his opinion based on those test results. 
      
       
     63 Evidence was adduced to try to explain why the differences in retention times should not invalidate Mr Ballard’s conclusions. The first was that the solvent mixtures used for the standard and the unknown samples were different. In my opinion the jury should have found the evidence unconvincing in view of the fact that no record was made of the nature of the solvents used. Evidence was adduced of tests run on methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine using two solvents in which retention times for pseudoephedrine differed by 0.4 minutes whereas those for methylamphetamine were substantially the same. However, no print-out of the mass spectrum of pseudoephedrine was produced and Dr Kibby disagreed that the peak referred to showed pseudoephedrine at all. In my opinion this evidence was unlikely to go any way towards removing the doubt thrown on Mr Ballard’s conclusions. 
      
       
     64 Evidence was also adduced of GCMS tests done after Mr Ballard’s certification. On 15 September 1999 sample 991691 was tested by Mr Murtagh and he concluded that the substance was methcathinone. However, the relative intensity of ions 77, 51 and 56 deviated by more than 20% from the standard relative intensity. On 18 August 2000 Mr Murtagh tested sample 991685. The relative intensity of ions was not significantly different from that in the test of 15 September 1999. The retention time was greater than 0.2 minutes from the standard 9.8 minutes and the shape of the computer-produced peak came under heavy criticism. The last test was done on 18 January 2001. All samples 991685 to 991691 were tested. The relative intensity of ions was not significantly different from that demonstrated in the two other tests and other criticisms were levelled at the results. In my opinion these results could go no way towards removing doubts about the conclusion contended for by the Crown.  
      
       
     65 When hearing an appeal under this ground the Court is to consider all the evidence. However, for reasons which I have explained it is not necessary to go outside the evidence of Mr Murtagh, Mr Ballard and Dr Kibby. In my opinion the jury, having considered the evidence of those witnesses and having given appropriate weight to such of it as might support Mr Ballard’s conclusion, I should have continued to have a reasonable doubt about the correctness of Mr Ballard’s opinion.  
      
       
     66 No complaint is made about the summing-up. The jury were appropriately instructed and their attention was drawn to the shortcomings of Mr Ballard’s evidence. I think that serious doubts ought to have existed in the minds of the jury about his identification by visual comparison alone on 15 July 1999 and in the tests of 24 August 1999. I am fortified in my view by these remarks of the trial judge on sentence - 
      
       
        
         
         In an interlocutory judgment, after the Crown case had closed, I expressed a view as to the value of Mr Ballard’s evidence, in light of the cross-examination of him, and, more particularly, in light of his having admitted “interacting” with the GCMS testing on 25 August 1999, when it had become apparent that the machine had produced a retention time inconsistent with his previously formed opinion. 
         
        
        
         
         I went so far as to say that if I had been the judge of fact, on that basis, and on the basis of other misgivings more particularly relating to relative ion intensities, I would have rejected Mr Ballard’s evidence and acquitted each of the accused, in respect of all charges, on that ground alone. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     67 I would uphold the first ground of appeal. It is unnecessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal filed by any of the appellants. I propose that in each appeal the appeal be upheld and the conviction quashed and that a verdict of acquittal be entered.  
      
       
     68 Bergin J: I agree with Barr J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 7 February 2003, the Director of Public Prosecutions lodged in the Court and served notices of appeal dated 5 February 2003 against the alleged inadequacy of sentences pronounced by his Honour Acting Judge Moore at the Campbelltown District Court on 4 December 2002 upon CJP, CAD and MES. The three matters had been heard together by his Honour. 
     
      
    2 The notices of appeal came before this Court on 28 May 2003, when the Court raised with counsel for each of the parties certain jurisdictional and procedural problems. The matters were then adjourned to allow the parties to make written submissions in relation to these questions. It is necessary for the resolution of these problems to consider the relevant background. 
     
      
    3 On 24 June 2002 at Liverpool Local Court CJP pleaded guilty to each of the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that between 18 October 2000 and 27 October 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did have sexual intercourse with ELP, a child between the age of ten and sixteen years, namely thirteen years; and 
         
        (b) that between 17 October 2000 and 27 October 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did have sexual intercourse with ELP, a child between the age of ten and sixteen years, namely thirteen years;  
         
          
          in each case contrary to the provisions of s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act). The maximum penalty for each offence at the time of its commission, was imprisonment for a term of eight years; 
          
         
        (c) that between 14 November 2000 and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields, he did have sexual intercourse with ELP without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, that at the time of the offence the said ELP was a person aged under the age of sixteen years, being in fact aged thirteen years of age; 
         
        (d) that between 14 November 2000 and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields, he did have sexual intercourse with ELP without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, that at the time of the offence the said ELP was a person aged under the age of sixteen years, being in fact aged thirteen years of age; and 
         
        (e) that between 14 November and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did have sexual intercourse with GS without his consent and knowing that he was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, that at the time of the offence the said GS was a person aged under the age of sixteen years, being in fact aged thirteen years of age; in each case contrary to the provisions of s 61J of the Act. The maximum penalty for each at the time of its commission was imprisonment for twenty years. 
        
       
      
    4 The respondent was committed for sentence accordingly. 
     
      
    5 In November 2002 at Campbelltown District Court the respondent adhered to his pleas and asked that the following offences be taken into account, pursuant to a Form 1 under the provisions of s 32 and s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, when being sentenced for the offence set forth in par (c) above under s 61J of the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that on or about 14 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did incite GS a person under the age of sixteen years, namely thirteen years, to perform an act of indecency towards him, contrary to the provisions of s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act 1900; 
         
        (b) that on or about 14 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did have sexual intercourse with SD without her consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence she was under sixteen years of age, namely ten years, contrary to the provisions of s 61J(1) of that Act; 
         
        (c) that on or about 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did attempt to have homosexual intercourse with GS, he being ten to eighteen years, namely thirteen years, contrary to the provisions of s 78L of that Act; 
         
        (d) that between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 he did have sexual intercourse with GS without his consent knowing he did not consent in circumstances of aggravation namely he being under the age of sixteen years, namely thirteen years, contrary to the provisions of s 61J(1) of that Act; and 
         
        (e) that between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 he did have sexual intercourse with GS without his consent knowing he did not consent in circumstances of aggravation namely he being under the age of sixteen years, namely thirteen years old, contrary to the provisions of s 61J(1) of that Act. 
        
       
      
    6 On 8 April 2002 CAD was arraigned before his Honour Judge Sides QC at the Campbelltown District Court upon an indictment containing three counts, each of which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields she did have sexual intercourse with GS, without his consent, knowing that he was not consenting and being a person under the age of 16 years namely 13 years; and  
        in the alternative 
         to each of the three charges; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields she did have sexual intercourse with GS, a child then between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 13 years. 
        
       
      
    7 CAD pleaded not guilty to the three counts as set out in paragraph (a) being charges contrary to s 61J of the Act; and guilty to those counts as set out in paragraph (b) being charges contrary to s 66C(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    8 The Crown accepted those pleas of guilty in full discharge of the indictment then presented. 
     
      
    9 On 4 March 2002, MES was arraigned before his Honour Judge Sides QC at the Campbelltown District Court upon an indictment in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that between 30 January 1999 and 30 December 1999 at Macquarie Fields she did have sexual intercourse with GS, without the consent of GS, knowing that he was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely that GS was under the authority of the respondent; and,  
        in the alternative 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that between 30 January 1999 and 30 December 1999 at Macquarie Fields she did have sexual intercourse with GS, he being a child between the age of 10 and 16 and under the authority of the respondent; 
        
       
       
        
        MES pleaded not guilty to the major count and guilty to the alternative count. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty in full satisfaction of the indictment then presented. 
        
       
      
    10 On 29 November 2002, at Campbelltown District Court MES asked Acting Judge Moore to take into account on a Form 1 the following offence: 
     
      
       
        
        That between 17 October 2000 and 27 October 2000 she did aid and abet CJP to have sexual intercourse with ELP, a child between the ages of 10 and 16 years under his authority, contrary to the provisions of ss 66C(2) and 345 of the Act. 
        
       
       
      Proceedings on 29 November 2002. 
       
      
    11 On 29 November 2002, all three respondents appeared before Acting Judge Moore for sentence at Campbelltown District Court, when Mr Wagstaff appeared for the Crown, Mr Keaney for CJP, Mr Butland for CAD and Mr Velcic for MES. Relatively brief oral evidence was given by CJP, and documentary material relevant to sentence was tendered on behalf of each respondent. The matters were then stood over “for sentence” on 4 December 2002. All respondents were remanded by his Honour to appear on that day. 
     
      
       
      Proceedings on 4 December 2002. 
       
      
    12 When the matters came before his Honour on 4 December, the appearances were as before, and the three respondents were personally present. 
     
      
    13 It is now necessary to refer to certain passages from the transcript of proceedings on that day. 
     
      
    14 At the outset, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: There are some matters which I need to just elucidate with counsel just to make sure what I’ve been considering is correct. I propose to give the sentences at 2 o’clock. As my reasons will need to be expressed with considerable care they won’t be ready in that form at two and I propose to deliver them in the morning. Is there any objection to my going about the matter in that way. I should give reasons at the time the sentences are announced I truly acknowledge. But as your clients have been brought here today and they’re anxious to get their sentences – I shall at least indicate at 2 o’clock what they will be tomorrow. But I thought that they may not want to come back tomorrow just to hear the reasons which will be typed and sent to them. 
        
       
       
        
        KEANEY: I just missed the last bit your Honour. You said the reasons will be typed -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The reasons will be typed and sent to them so you can get some instructions between now and 2 o’clock. In any event at 2 o’clock I’ll indicate what the sentences are I have in mind and your clients can either come back tomorrow and hear them or not. So get some instructions about that.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour then raised certain aspects of the charges with the parties and the relevant factual background. The parties had each provided his Honour with written submissions. 
     
      
    16 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: So what I’ll do at 2 o’clock then is one of two things. I’ll either indicate what I propose the sentences to be and stand them over till tomorrow or I will formally sentence at 2 o’clock and deliver written reasons in the morning. But the latter course would require the consent of everybody involved because I should deliver reasons at the time I announce the sentence. But it may save bringing your clients here if they don’t want to come back and simply want – they will get it. I will fax a copy to their legal representatives at once in the morning. So let me know at 2 o’clock what your clients want.” 
        
       
      
    17 Following further discussion between his Honour and counsel, the luncheon adjournment was taken. 
     
      
    18 Upon resumption there was further brief discussion between his Honour and counsel. The transcript of the proceedings then reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: One way or the other I’ll give an indication now of what I’m going to say in the morning or else I will actually sentence him now and he need not come back tomorrow, that’s the point of it. 
        
       
       
        
        VELCIC: Your Honour we’d prefer now. 
        
       
       
        
        KEANEY: My instructions are the same your Honour. We’d prefer to avoid coming back tomorrow if possible and happy to go with that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Butland what do you have to say? 
        
       
       
        
        BUTLAND: I have concurred with my friends. I would be in difficulties tomorrow like my friends. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: These are the sentences. For [CJP] the aggregate sentence would have been one of 12 years imprisonment. It is reduced because of your plea of guilty to 9 years. Because of special circumstances that will be subdivided into a period of 6 year non-parole period and an additional term of 3 years. The commencing date will be 28 November 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case of [MES] the sentence originally arrived at is one of 4 years which I reduce for your plea of guilty to 3 years and for special circumstances there will be a non-parole period of 2 years. I recognise the fact that you’ve spent 2 years in gaol and therefore I reduce each of those periods by a further 21 days so that your sentence will be one of a total term of 2 years 344 days with a non-parole period of 1 year and 344 days and I direct that you be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period subject to the standard conditions and the supervision conditions. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case of [CAD] I will stand this matter over for an assessment by the Probation and Parole Service (sic) your suitability for period (sic) detention. If that can be done this afternoon I would like to have that done if it’s possible. 
        
       
       
        
        BUTLAND: Your Honour I did take the opportunity to re-read the pre-sentence report dated 30 May from Tanya Bevan and she says at point 4 on the last page the offender has been assessed as suitable for period detention order as per the requirements of s 66(1) of the Crimes et cetera and has signed an undertaking as required by the Act. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The pre-sentence report has (sic) somehow not amongst the papers that I have. 
        
       
       
        
        BUTLAND: I’m quite happy to tender my copy to the Court. That aspect was covered. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I was assuming that there wasn’t one because we had a psychiatrist’s report I assumed that we didn’t have one. 
        
       
       
        
        Very well in the case of [CAD] her sentence is one of two years, taking into account all the features of your plea of guilty and the element of your volunteering your crime to the authorities, modified by the fact that it was stimulated by the letter from [CJP] I direct that that sentence should be served by way of periodic detention and there will be a non-parole period of 1 year. I will formally pronounce the order when we have an indication of where periodic detention is available.” 
        
       
      
    19 After some discussion regarding periodic detention facilities for CAD, his Honour indicated that his associate would make inquiries as to the availability of an appropriate centre. 
     
      
    20 After a brief adjournment, the transcript reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: The only available centre is the Norma Parker Centre at Parramatta. I take it that’s convenient to your client if she lives at -- 
        
       
       
        
        BUTLAND: Entirely convenient about a 15, 20 minute walk from the station. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Very well. I sentence you to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year both periods commencing today. I direct that you – sorry both periods commencing on 14 December 2002. I direct that you report to the Norma Parker Centre at number 1 Fleet Street, Parramatta at 8.30 am on Saturday 14 December and thereafter at 7.00 pm each Friday. I direct that you be released to parole on 13 December 2003 in accordance with the standard conditions and the supervision conditions. I pass that sentence on counts 2 and 4 in the indictment. On count 6 in the indictment I defer passing sentence conditional on your entering into a bond under s 9 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act to be of good behaviour for two years and to appear and receive sentence if called on. The bond is further conditioned on your accepting the supervision and treatment from Dr Jeremy O’Dea or from (sic) and accepting any other treatment to which you are directed by your supervisor. 
        
       
       
        
        Did I say supervision by Probation and Parole Service. And I direct that you – and subject to your reporting to the Probation and Parole Office at Campbelltown within 7 days.” 
        
       
      
    21 Despite the fact that his Honour had indicated that he would give reasons for sentence on 5 December, the matters did not come back before the Court until 28 February 2003 when his Honour handed down a document referred to as “Remarks on Sentence”. It will be necessary to refer to that document at a later stage of the judgment. 
     
      
    22 Insofar as CJP is concerned it is clear from the above excerpts that although CJP stood to be sentenced for a total of five charges, two of sexual intercourse with a child between ten and sixteen years, and three of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, his Honour merely expressed the sentence to be nine years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of six years, to date from 28 November 2000. Indeed, that is the “sentence” identified in the Crown notice of appeal dated 5 February 2003. It is perfectly clear, however, that his Honour’s pronouncement in this regard cannot be taken to be a valid sentence embracing each of the five offences. 
     
      
    23 If the matter had remained there, problems would have arisen, in particular, with regard to the issue of the appropriate warrant of commitment of CJP pursuant to s 62 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 62(1) provides that as soon as practicable after sentencing an offender to imprisonment a court must issue a warrant for the committal of the offender to a correctional centre. Such warrant must be in or to the effect of the form prescribed by the regulations and signed by a Justice (subs 2). 
     
      
    24 A copy of the warrant is not before this Court. However, this Court was provided with an endorsement dated 4 December 2002 on the committal for sentence form. That endorsement is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 1. (Taking Form 1 into account.) 8 years imprisonment commencing:  
        28 Nov 00

        Offences on Form 1 taken into account on Count 1.” 
        
       
      
    25 It appears clear then that after the Court adjourned on 4 December 2002, his Honour, in the absence of the parties, and their legal representatives, sought to impose sentences in relation to each of the counts to which the respondent CJP had pleaded guilty. The individual “sentences” involve an aggregate head sentence of nine years with an aggregate non-parole period of six years, as indicated earlier by his Honour in open court.  
     
      
    26 There are respectfully two errors of law in this document. First, his Honour indicated that he took into account the offences on the Form 1 document on count 1. The term “count” is inappropriate because as these were committals for sentence from the Local Court, no indictment was found. In any event it is clear that his Honour was there taking the offences on the Form 1 into account in relation to the first matter under s 66C(1) of the Act, whereas the Form 1 document required those offences to be taken into account under the first offence under s 61J of the Act. This is of particular significance because the maximum penalty, as has been noted, for an offence under s 66C(1) is eight years whereas the maximum for an offence under s 61J is twenty years. 
     
      
    27 Secondly, it was not open to his Honour to impose an aggregate non-parole period of six years commencing on 28 November 2000: see s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    28 The threshold question is whether CJP was lawfully sentenced on 4 December 2002. 
     
      
    29 In our view the answer must be in the negative. Lawrence v The King [1933] AC 699 (Privy Council) is long standing authority for the proposition that a judge has no jurisdiction after the discharge of the jury and in the absence of the accused to alter the sentence recorded at the trial, even if the term of imprisonment is not effectively altered but distributed among the counts so as to avoid exceeding the maximum punishment on some of them. Lord Atkin, speaking for the Board, said (at 708): 
     
      
       
        
        “But in addition to this vital defect in the procedure up to verdict there has to be considered the alteration and recording of the sentence in the absence of the accused. It is an essential principle of our criminal law that the trial for an indictable offence has to be conducted in the presence of the accused; and for this purpose trial means the whole of the proceedings, including sentence. There is authority for saying that in cases of misdemeanour there may be special circumstances which permit a trial in the absence of the accused, but on trials for felony the rule is inviolable, unless possibly the violent conduct of the accused himself intended to make trial impossible renders it lawful to continue in his absence. The result is that sentence passed for felony in the absence of the accused is totally invalid. In the present case a double error has been made. In the first place the general sentence of three years’ imprisonment is invalid, for it is applicable to each count, and for the offences charged in the counts for false accounting the maximum punishment is two years. If the matter rested here it would appear that upon case stated the appellate Court under s 171 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance would have had power to reverse, affirm or amend the judgment. But unfortunately the learned judge in chambers in the absence of the accused and apparently at the request of the Solicitor-General varied the sentence on the record, by substituting on the record a sentence of one year’s imprisonment on the third count and two years’ imprisonment on the fourth count to run consecutively, and corresponding sentences on the remaining counts for false accounting and larceny all to run concurrently with the sentences on the counts 3 and 4 with each other. The warrant of commitment recites this sentence as being that which the sheriff is directed to carry into execution according to law.” 
        
       
      
    30 The Crown’s argument (in its additional submissions) is that the above principles have no application in the instant case because of the abolition by s 580E(2) of the Act of all distinctions between misdemeanours and felonies. Section 580E(4) provides that subject to the regulations, in any Act or instrument: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a reference to a felony is to be taken to be a reference to a ‘serious indictable offence’.” 
        
       
      
    31 Section 4 of the Act defines a serious indictable offence to mean “an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of five years or more”. 
     
      
    32 In this context we are of the view that the principles in Lawrence necessarily apply to serious indictable offences such as those under consideration in the instant case. 
     
      
    33 Lawrence has been applied by this Court in R v Cornwell [1972] 2 NSWLR 1. More recently it was applied by the Privy Council in Kunnath v The State [1993] 1 WLR 1315 where the Privy Council emphasised that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is an essential principle of the criminal law that a trial for an indictable offence should be conducted in the presence of the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    34 The above passage was cited by the High Court in Ebatarinja v Deland (1998) 194 CLR 444 at 454. 
     
      
    35 Lawrence is still the law in England: see Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol II(1), Fourth Edition Reissue at par 1053, and the cases there cited. 
     
      
    36 No question arises here as, for example, in R v Jones (No 2) (1972) 1 WLR 887 of the offender voluntarily absenting himself from the proceedings.  
     
      
    37 That being so the “sentences” imposed on CJP on 4 December 2002 by his Honour were in circumstances “in which the judge had no possible jurisdiction”, to use the expression of Lord Atkin in Lawrence. 
     
      
       
      Proceedings on 28 February 2003. 
       
      
    38 It is convenient now to consider the events of 28 February 2003, to which reference has already been made. 
     
      
    39 The transcript for that day commences with the notation: “(Remarks on Sentence handed down in document form and not sound recorded)”. 
     
      
    40 The document, which consists of forty-two pages, commences: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Apology 
        
       
       
        
        1. I apologise for the delay in giving these reasons. The cause of the delay is stated at the end of these reasons.” 
        
       
      
    41 The concluding portion of the document reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Explanation for the delay in giving these Remarks on Sentence 
        
       
       
        
        116. This is only the second time in my judicial career that I have not delivered Remarks on Sentence either at once or on the morning following the hearing. Each time the delay was due to my mistake. In the present case the hearing finished on 4 December 2002. I said I would deliver reasons next morning, and excused the parties. 
        
       
       
        
        117. I prepared the reasons that evening. That period, at the end of term, was a particularly busy one. Next day the matter was not put in the written list. It was a busy day. I overlooked delivering the reasons. To my shame I record that, as time passed, I thought I had delivered the reasons, and at the end of term I went on vacation believing I had no outstanding matters. The parties were so courteous as not to enquire from the Registry until this month, which led to my recovering my reasons from the comprehensive notes I made on 4 December 2002. This is no excuse and a sorry explanation. 
        
       
       
        
        118. I have now only dictated what I had ready for 5 December 2002, without any addition. 
        
       
       
        
        119. I repeat my apology to all who are affected. There should not have been this added stress in these difficult matters.” 
        
       
      
    42 As is evident, the document was handed down after the Crown had filed and served its notices of appeal. There is nothing to indicate who was present in court at the time the document was handed down. There is certainly no suggestion that the respondents were present in person.  
     
      
    43 It is convenient first to consider certain aspects of the document which refer to CJP. Having considered in some detail the various submissions that were put to his Honour both by the Crown and counsel for CJP, the document states in relation to CJP: 
     
      
       
        
        “54. It is important where possible, and specially important in this case, to indicate clearly the allowance for a plea of guilty. The technique I am about to follow is not simply to adopt a ‘two-tiered’ approach criticised, for example, in  
        AB v The Queen 
         (1999) 198 CLR 111, by McHugh J, but expressly not by Kirby J. It is in accordance with the Court of Appeal’s decision in  
        Thomson and Houlton. 
        
       
       
        
        55. I assess first the sentences had there been no plea of guilty. I take head sentences first. I pass sentence first on the  
        third committal for sentence (crime (v)) 
         as it calls in the Form 1. The Form 1 offences are not simply subsumed in crime (v) for sentencing. They require an increase. I indicate how I have made the increase. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Crime (v) alone 
           – 5 years 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Form 1 
           – allowances to be made to Crime (v) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Crime (iii) - 1 year, concurrent 
             
            Crime (viii) - 5 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
             
            Crime (iv) - 3 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
             
            Crime (ix) - 5 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
             
            Crime (x) - 5 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The total sentence for the third committal – 9 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For the  
          first committal for sentence 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (Crime (i)) - 5 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For the  
          second committal for sentence 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (Crime (ii)) - 5 years, cumulative as to 6 months 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For the  
          fourth committal for sentence 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (Crime (vi)) - 5 years, cumulative as to 6 months 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For the  
          fifth committal for sentence 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (Crime (vii)) - 5 years, cumulative as to 1 year 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The total is twelve years. I reduce that for the plea of guilty, by 25 per cent, to  
        nine years 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        56. The statutory fraction to reach the non-parole period would produce six years nine months non-parole. 
        
       
       
        
        57. I find special circumstances - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) His demonstrated rehabilitation over the past two years, given that he has to prove that that will continue after his release. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The good likelihood of his not re-offending, given his history, and antecedents, the medical evidence, his remorse and his genuine wish to follow professional assistance. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The need for lengthy supervision at large after his release. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His being kept in strict protection is a factor sometimes allowed as a special circumstance. I have already reduced the head sentence for this. There is some overlap also in the head sentence considerations as to the factors (a) to (c) above. I shall only increase his eligibility for parole by nine months, as any greater increase would lead to an undue balance with the objective features. That is, the non-parole period is six years. The commencing date is the date [CJP] went into custody – 28 November 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        58. The sentences will be - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The third committal 
           - 6 years 9 months 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The first committal 
           - 3 years 9 months, cumulative as to 9 months 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The second committal  
          - 3 years 9 months, cumulative as to 4-1/2 months 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The fourth committal 
           - 3 years 9 months, cumulative as to 4-1/2 months 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The fifth committal 
           - 3 years 9 months, cumulative as to 9 months 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        59. The current state of the legislative see-saw is that, where there are multiple sentences with cumulation, there must be individual specification of commencing and expiry dates of each head sentence and (this can cause other problems which do not arise here) non-parole period. An aggregate non-parole period commencing and expiry date cannot be the sole specification. My intention is that [CJP] should not be eligible for parole before 27 November 2006. Therefore as the sentence dates progress, with no alteration to the expiration of the non-parole period, the non-parole periods will be distorted. This is the additional special circumstance for their distortion.

    44 The Court notes immediately that the head “sentences” set out above do not correspond with the sentences set out in the endorsement to the committal for sentence document of 4 December 2002. The only consistency (if such it could be called) is that there is an aggregate head sentence of nine years with an aggregate non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    45 However, a non-parole period is allocated to each specific offence in the table as distinct from the global non-parole period endorsed on the committal for sentence. 
     
      
    46 Further, his Honour has taken into account the offences in the Form 1 in the third committal for sentence matter and not in the first committal for sentence matter, as in the endorsement. 
     
      
    47 Whatever his Honour’s intentions may have been by the publication of this document, it cannot be taken to be the formal sentencing of CJP with accompanying reasons for sentence. Leaving aside for the moment what transpired on 4 December 2002, the “sentences” were not announced in open court and CJP was not present. There is nothing to indicate that he had voluntarily absented himself. The document cannot be treated as reasons for the “sentences” imposed on 4 December 2002 because no valid sentences were imposed on that date. In any event, as will be explained later, the “reasons for sentences” are too remote in time. 
     
      
    48 This leads to the exceptional and unfortunate consequence that at no stage has CJP been lawfully sentenced in the District Court with respect to the charges to which he pleaded guilty and for which he acknowledged responsibility in the Form 1 document. That being so, it is the view of this Court that the appropriate procedure is for this Court to remit the proceedings relating to the respondent CJP pursuant to the provisions of s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to the District Court with a direction that he is to be sentenced in accordance with the law and contemporaneous reasons are to be given.  
     
      
    49 It is convenient to deal generally with CAD and MES together. We have already referred to the remarks of his Honour on 4 December 2002 in relation to these two respondents. As at that date both CAD and MES were on bail, which was granted in the case of CAD on 15 May 2001 and in the case of MES on 29 November 2000. 
     
      
    50 The evidence discloses that CAD has been serving periodic detention since 14 December 2002, and MES has been serving the full time custodial “sentence” which was believed to have been imposed on 4 December 2002. 
     
      
    51 We return now to the document handed down by his Honour on 28 February 2003. After having referred to the objective and subjective circumstances in relation to CAD, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Sentence 
        
       
       
        
        115. You are convicted on the pleas of guilty. On counts two and four in the indictment, you are sentenced to imprisonment for two years to be served by periodic detention. I find special circumstances. Non-parole period of one year. Both terms to commence from 14 December 2002. I direct you be released to parole on 13 December 2003 subject to the prescribed conditions, the supervision conditions, and the special condition that you comply with the bond next specified. On count six, I defer passing sentence. I direct you enter a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for two years from 14 December 2002, with the standard conditions and the special conditions that you accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, and treatment from Dr O’Dea and any other treatment directed by your supervisor, and that you report to Campbelltown Probation and Prole Service (sic) within seven days.” 
        
       
      
    52 This “sentence” does not differ in terms from that purported to have been imposed on 4 December 2002. It is also consistent with the endorsement on that date by his Honour on the indictment relating to CAD. 
     
      
    53 In this context it is important to note, however, that the imposition of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention cannot be backdated: see s 70 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that where a court has made a periodic detention order in relation to a sentence of imprisonment, the court is to fix the date of the commencement of the sentence so that the date of commencement occurs no earlier than seven days, and no later than twenty-one days, after the date on which the order was made. 
     
      
    54 We have not overlooked in this context that s 70(3) provides that a periodic detention order is not invalidated merely because it specifies a date of commencement of the sentence of imprisonment that does not comply with the requirements of the section.  
     
      
    55 After having considered the objective and subjective circumstances relating to MES, his Honour stated in the document handed down on 28 February 2003: 
     
      
       
        
        “93. My mind has wavered as to whether I should increase the sentence for the first crime, by taking the second crime into account on Form 1. I have decided not to do so, for the same reasons as I would have made a concurrent sentence of three years if the second crime had been subject of a charge. The reasons are – 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - she was a principal in the second degree 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - [CJP] told her to remain, do nothing and be silent 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - she went along with the offence because of fear of, and dependence on, [CJP], as was the case with the first crime 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - she derived no sexual gratification, as was the case with the first crime 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - although separate in time, nature and victim, both crimes were a function of her subjection to [CJP]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        94. On the first crime, the sentence would have been four years, but for the plea of guilty. I reduce that by twenty-five percent, to three years, for the plea. For special circumstances I vary the parole period so that there is a non-parole period of two years. As there was twenty-one days pre-sentence custody, the sentence and non-parole period are reduced by twenty-one days. 
        
       
       
        
        95. You are convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment for two years 344 days, with a non-parole period of one year 344 days. Both periods commence 4 December 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        96. I direct your release to parole on 13 November 2004.” 
        
       
      
    56 This “sentence” is effectively the same as that purported to have been imposed on 4 December 2002 and the endorsement by his Honour on the indictment on the same date, except that on that earlier date no reference was made to the offence on the Form 1.  
     
      
    57 The threshold question which arises in the cases of both female respondents is whether they were validly sentenced by his Honour on 4 December 2002 bearing in mind that no reasons for sentence were delivered by his Honour on that day or proximately close in time to that day. 
     
      
    58 Both Mr Butland of counsel for CAD and Mr Stratton of counsel for MES submitted to this Court that the proceedings on 4 December 2002 were invalid because of the omission of his Honour to deliver contemporaneous reasons for the sentences which he purported to impose on that day. 
     
      
    59 As to the requirement of contemporaneity, Pt 31 r 9 of the District Court Rules states: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the Court gives any judgment or makes any order and reduces to writing its reasons for the judgment or order, it is sufficient to state orally the judgment or order without stating the reasons, but the written reasons must then be given by delivering them to an Associate, or other officer specified by the Court, for delivery to the parties.” 
        
       
      
    60 This rule gives rise to difficulties of construction and has been considered at appellate level in a number of civil matters. Some of those judgments are not easy to reconcile and, despite their learning, do not provide any specific assistance for the resolution of the present problem. The leading civil cases are referred to in the District Court Procedure NSW at 6719-6722. 
     
      
    61 The question of the need for adequate reasons to be given when a sentence is delivered in a criminal case presents significantly different problems from those which arise in a civil case. Significantly, a criminal case involves the liberty of the subject and generally raises wider questions of public interest. 
     
      
    62 This Court has consistently emphasised the necessity for sentencing judges to give reasons when imposing sentences. Reference may be made to certain of the more recent judgments of this Court in that regard. In R v Julie Anne Duffy [1999] NSWCCA 321 Sully J said (with the concurrence of Ireland and Hidden JJ) at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wish to add the following observations: the Remarks on Sentence, as I said during submissions, are unhelpful in their brevity. It is not expected that a sentencing judge and particularly a sentencing judge in the District Court, will write an essay in jurisprudence every time he or she comes to deliver remarks on sentence. But it is, I think, timely to say that the Court expects that primary sentencing judges will at least state, however briefly, the findings of fact upon which they are persuaded to proceed; and will then expose in relation to those facts as found a coherent process of reasoning which will sufficiently equip this Court to intervene if asked to do so, and if a cause for doing so is otherwise shown.” 
        
       
      
    63 In R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 Spigelman CJ was concerned with s 22(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides in relation to a plea of guilty: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so.” 
        
       
       
      (With the concurrence of the other members of the Court) Spigelman CJ said at 394-395: 
       
       
        
        “[42] Sentencing judges are under an obligation to give reasons for their decisions. Remarks on sentence are no different in this respect from other judgments. This is a manifestation of the fundamental principle of the common law that justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done. The obligation of a court is to publish reasons for its decision, not merely to provide reasons to the parties: see F Kitto,  
        ‘Why Write Judgments’ 
         (1992) 66 ALJ 787;  
        Pettitt v Dunkley 
         [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 at 382;  
        Housing Commission (NSW) v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd 
         [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 385-386;  
        Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond 
         (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 666-667;  
        Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd 
         (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 273, 277-281; Spigelman,  
        ‘Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice: Part 1’ 
         (2000) 74 ALJ 290, especially at 294 and 295. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] The statement of reasons performs particularly significant functions in the administration of the criminal law. As Brennan J said in  
        Jago v District Court 
         (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 50: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘... The victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [44] To similar effect are the observations of Sir John Barry (quoted with approval by McHugh J, Hayne J and Callinan J in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 622 [39]) concerning the criminal law that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘... It must be administered publicly in such a fashion that its activities can be understood by ordinary citizens and regarded by them as conforming with the community's generally accepted standards of what is fair and just.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (See also  
        Richmond Newspapers v Virginia 
         448 US 555 (1980) at 571-572, per Burger CJ.)” 
        
       
      
    64 It should be noted in this context that s 22(4) provides that the failure of a court to comply with that section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court. However, that does not detract from the relevance of the remarks by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    65 In R v JCE (2000) 120 A Crim R 18 at 21 Fitzgerald JA said with the concurrence of the other members of the Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “[19] A sentencing judge must explain his or her decision. That might require discussion of some other sentencing options with reasons why those options were not adopted. For example, that is implicit in s 5(1) and expressly provided for by s 5(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, it is obviously unnecessary for every possibility to be discussed in every case. For example, it is unnecessary to explain why community service is not an appropriate sentence for a murderer. Further, the ultimate decision, for example, whether a term of imprisonment should be eight years or nine years, frequently involves a subjective judgment, based on experience as well as information, which cannot be precisely and comprehensively articulated.” 
        
       
      
    66 The emphatic nature of the opening sentence of the immediately above quoted remarks is of particular significance. It is in accordance with the principle that a sentencing judge must give reasons and, further, there must be contemporaneity between the handing down of the sentence and the expression of the judge’s reasons. The separation of the imposition of the sentence from the expression of the appropriate reasons not only creates a sense of injustice in the mind of all concerned with the sentencing process but also creates significant practical difficulties.  
     
      
    67 Thus, in the instant case the Crown, anxious to avoid delay, filed notices of appeal against what were purported to be sentences imposed on 4 December 2002, although no reasons had thus far been delivered. 
     
      
    68 Mr Stratton submitted, rightly in our view, that such separation tended to bring the sentencing process into disrepute, as it may suggest that the reasons are being moulded to fit in with a predetermined sentence, rather than the other way around. Secondly, he argued, that the sequence of events in this case was capable of giving the impression that the reasons for sentence could be influenced by the Crown appeals. It is not suggested, of course, that his Honour was influenced by the appeals; the significant matter is the perception. 
     
      
    69 This case is an appropriate one for this Court to state in emphatic terms that not only must a sentencing judge give reasons consistent with any statutory obligations as well as the common law obligation, but there must be a contemporaneity between the pronouncement of the sentence and the delivery of reasons, be they oral or written. 
     
      
    70 When the Court speaks of contemporaneity, allowance must be made for the rare case when, for example, due to the exigencies of the circumstances a sentence is pronounced late on one day and reasons are delivered at the first opportunity on the following day. A failure to comply with this requirement bespeaks a miscarriage of justice which renders the sentence liable to be quashed by this Court and the matter remitted to the sentencing court. 
     
      
    71 Upon the assumption which must be made, that his Honour intended to sentence the two female respondents on 4 December 2002 the delay of almost three months in the delivery of reasons cannot conceivably comply with the requirement of contemporaneity. Thus the sentences imposed on CAD and MES must be set aside. The appropriate course then is to remit the matters to the District Court for sentences to be imposed in accordance with the law which necessarily includes the delivery of contemporaneous reasons.  
     
      
    72 For the sake of good order, it should be noted that because the sentencing proceedings relating to CJP miscarried for other reasons, it was not necessary specifically to consider the question of separation between sentences and reasons. However, it goes without saying that the principle is one of general application.

     Regina v Paul DUNCAN 
      
     Regina v Adam John PERRE 
    The Appellants, Duncan and Perre, were convicted on 24 March on counts of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent (s 33 Crimes Act 1900 NSW) and affray (s 93C Crimes Act) and were sentenced on 19 August 2003. A fight had erupted between two groups giving rise to the victim being attacked by a number of assailants with poles, a machete and a wheel brace. This resulted in his permanent disability. The Appellants received sentences of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years for the s 33 offence and concurrent fixed terms of 2 years for the s 93C offences. They each bring an appeal against the convictions and seek leave to appeal against the sentence. Perre’s Appeal Against ConvictionGrounds 1-2Did His Honour’s discretion miscarry in allowing the Crown under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the witness, Siljanoski in relation to his visual identification? Held: R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170 and R v Taufua NSWCCA 11 November 1996 are distinguishable. First, in the present case, the witness had sufficient prior familiarity with the accused. Secondly, in the context of whether it would have been reasonable to have an identification parade, Perre had earlier not co-operated in an identification parade related to a connected assault from the same night. It was certain that his participation pertaining to a more serious charge would have been refused. Additionally, no objection was made at trial (see Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 199 ALR 547and R v Stanley [2004] NSWCCA 278). Appropriate directions on identification evidence generally were given to the jury. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeals Rules applies. Leave to argue this ground is refused and the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Perre’s Appeal Against SentenceGround 3 Held: There was no error in his Honour’s approach to the evidence concerning the fact that the Appellant had been drinking alcohol before the offence. While alcohol may mitigate culpability through an offender acting out of character or in affecting the deliberateness of a crime: R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 417, it is not a license to commit crime: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381 at 387 per Tierney J. The deliberate and sustained nature of the crime suggests that the Appellant was not affected by alcohol to any great degree. Grounds 4 –6Held: There was latent error in the sentence given for the s 33 offence, being so far outside a proper exercise of legitimate sentencing discretion such that sufficient weight could not have been attached to the favourable subjective circumstances of the Appellant, including special circumstances existing relating to his age, thereby extinguishing all prospects of rehabilitation. Orders:1. Appeal against convictions dismissed;2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, but confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm; 3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed; 4. Quash the sentence for the s 33 offence and in lieu thereof the Appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period set of 9 years. Duncan’s Appeal Against ConvictionGround 1Did his Honour correctly allow Siljanoski to be cross-examined by the Crown? Held: His Honour correctly decided that the witness, Siljanoski’s evidence was at odds with his statement within s 38(1)(b) and (c) of the Evidence Act, thereby allowing the earlier out of court statement to be received as evidence of the facts of the attack: R v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997. S 38(1)(a) was also available, in so far as the evidence in chief was unfavourable to the Crown (see R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712, R v Veleski (No 2.) (1997) 93 A Crim R 420 and R v Lozano NSWCCA 10 June 1997).His Honour did not fail to give sufficient attention to the probative and potential prejudicial effect of the evidence pursuant to s 192(2)(b), nor was he in error in not giving consideration to ss 135 and 137 when granting leave. The witness’s statement could not be considered unreliable or unfair: R v Nguyen (2002) NSWCCA 342 and R v Suteski (2002) NSWCCA 509. Moreover evidence of one witness’s identification may be properly taken into account in the context of the evidence as a whole: R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 and R v Rima (2003) NSWCCA 405.Ground 2: Should evidence of questioning of the Appellant during a search of his bedroom have been admitted, in that a support person was not present pursuant to s 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987? Held: Admissibility of this type of evidence depends upon the support person being in sufficient physical proximity. If this could not be proven, then s 13(b) had to be addressed and proper and sufficient reason shown for the absence of the support person. The evidence was of little importance in the entirety of the trial. No miscarriage of justice occurred, even if there were insufficient reasons. Ground 3Was there error in his Honour not giving a warning relating to evidence of Siljanoski in his statement, and elicited in cross-examination, as to Duncan being involved in the assault? Held: The need for care was obvious to the jury. Counsel had had not sought additional directions and a comprehensive direction had been given earlier in relation to consistency and inconsistency of account and in judging witnesses. Rule 4 applies and leave should be refused. Ground 4Was there error in not giving an Edwards direction? Held: The ground that his Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding lies has no merit, in the context of a Zoneff direction being given. Ground 5Did his Honour fail to adequately direct the jury as to specific intent and the alternative to the first count on the indictment? Held: This ground is not made good. Comprehensive directions were given in relation to joint enterprise and participation and his Honour gave a sufficient explanation of the ways that the Appellant could be held criminally responsible under the first count or the statutory alternative. The principles enunciated in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 and McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 applied. Ground 6Did his Honour fail to direct the jury with respect to the evidence of Siljanoski?Held: The ground that his Honour insufficiently directed the jury is not made good.Ground 7Did his Honour err in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients for the offence? Held: His Honour’s directions were clear. This ground is not made good. Duncan’s Appeal Against Sentence Ground (a)Did his Honour make erroneous findings as to the objective circumstances of the offence such as overstating the role and objective criminality of the Appellant? Held: There was evidence supporting findings that Duncan initiated the events leading to the attack and it was properly open for his Honour to find he was an active participant. Grounds (b), (c) and (d)Held: His Honour’s findings in respect of his lack of remorse and lack of insight were correct, but understated rehabilitative aspects connected to his relatively minor record, his immaturity and youth and his otherwise favourable subjective circumstances (see Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; s 3A(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999); and R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112).Ground (e)Held: In view of the significant differences between Duncan and Lamacchia, another offender, the parity argument was not made good: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134. Ground (f)Held: The sentence was so far outside the range of a legitimate sentencing discretion as to establish latent error. Leave to appeal is granted.Orders:1. Appeal against convictions dismissed;2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm, but otherwise refused;3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed;4. Quash the sentence imposed for that offence, and in lieu thereof sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period set of 9 years. - 96 -IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Appellants were indicted before his Honour Judge Dodd and a jury, on 24 February 2003, upon counts of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (s 33 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), and affray (s 93C Crimes Act). The Appellant Duncan was also indicted upon two further counts, each of maliciously damaging property (s 195(a) Crimes Act). 
     
      
    2 On 24 March 2003 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to each Appellant, on the s 33 and s 93C counts. Duncan was acquitted of the two s 195(a) counts. 
     
      
    3 Each Appellant brings an appeal against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, which was imposed on 18 August 2003, for the s 33 offence, of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. Concurrent fixed terms were imposed of 2 years imprisonment for the s 93C offences. The maximum sentences for these offences were imprisonment for 25 years and 5 years respectively.  
     
      
       
      A. THE EVIDENCE 
       
      
    4 The evidence is somewhat complex, having regard to the manner in which the events unfolded on the night of the offences, and also having regard to the large number of young people who were called as witnesses, not all of whom gave the same account.  
     
      
    5 To some extent these witnesses fell into separate groups. As will appear from the analysis of the evidence which follows, there were:  
     
      
       
      (a) Eight people who might loosely be described as the victim and his associates, namely the victim Christopher Wilson, Daniel Wilson, Mathew Michael, Paul Beiruti, Tughlet Homeh, Snezana Tankoska, Jovana Ljubojevic, and Christina Kusonogovski (from time to time referred to as “the Sydney group”); 
       
       
      (b) Four people who were independently present at the park, Diana Petroska, Lena Ivanovska, Ahmed Kak and Joseph Mishawi; and 
       
       
      (c) The remainder, excluding police and the witnesses who were not at the park, were friends and associates of the Appellants (from time to time referred to as “the Wollongong group”). 
       
       
      The Two Groups of Young People Gather in Stuart Park 
       
      
    6 On the night of Friday 2 November 2001, the victim Christopher Wilson travelled from Sydney to Wollongong with his brother Daniel Wilson, Paul Beiruti, Mathew Michael, and Tughlet Homeh. It was their intention to meet three local girls Snezana Tankoska, Jovana Ljubojevic and Christina Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    7 After meeting in the area near the lighthouse, they decided to drive to Stuart Park, in two motor vehicles, a blue Toyota Camry owned by Jovana Ljubojevic’s father and a black Toyota Celica owned by Mathew Michael. They parked near the Old Lagoon Restaurant intending to take shelter from the rain in a hut. Daniel Wilson, Tughlet Homeh and Paul Beiruti went to the hut. Jovana Ljubojevic sat in the Celica with the other two girls.  
     
      
    8 At the same time there was a birthday party taking place at the house of Elbert Jose, in Beach Street, which was a walk away from the Park. Both of the Appellants were described by a number of witnesses, including the host, Elbert Jose, as having been present at this party.  
     
      
    9 At about 11:30 PM, by which time it was common ground that the night was dark and that it was raining, the party started to break up and some of those present walked, or drove, to an area known as “the Strip” at South Beach, which is a known gathering spot for young people in Wollongong. 
     
      
    10 The Appellant Duncan (“Babe”) travelled to Stuart Park with Zoran Mitic, Steven Siljanoski, and two girls in a green Nissan Pulsar driven by Oliver Gjoreski. 
     
      
    11 The Appellant Duncan recognised Christina Kusonogovski at the Park, and using Zoran Mitic’s mobile phone he telephoned her elder brother, Jason Kusonogovski (“Bear”). In this regards Steven Siljanoski said that, after arriving at Stuart Park with Duncan, he saw him walk across the car park to speak to a girl. He said that it was then that Duncan asked Zoran Mitic if he could borrow his mobile phone. At the trial he acknowledged having heard bits of the conversation that followed, but said that he was not sure to whom Duncan was speaking. He said in chief that he heard him tell someone to “come down to the beach”. When he was cross-examined, by leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act, he acknowledged having said to police that Duncan had said over the phone:  
     
      
       
        
        “Come down to the beach if you don’t want your sister to get raped by a pack of Lebos”. 
        
       
       
      That evidence was only admitted against Duncan. 
       
      
    12 Zoran Mitic confirmed that he had lent his phone to Duncan, and said that he did not know Jason Kusonogovski. Of some importance in relation to this evidence is the fact that the telephone call charge records record a call from Mitic’s mobile phone to Kusonogovski’s phone at 11:57, followed by a call to the phone of Chi Tam Huynh (“Big Chi”), followed by another call to Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    13 Oliver Gjoreski gave evidence that after leaving their car for a while, Duncan returned and asked him whether he had a baseball bat in his car. Gjoreski said that he had removed it. Duncan then asked if he had anything else? Gjoreski pulled his boot release handle, saying that he did not know, but that Duncan was free to check. He heard Duncan rummaging around in the boot, but was unable to say whether he saw him remove anything before walking away. He gave evidence to the effect that there had been a wheel brace in the breakdown kit in the boot (possibly more appropriately described as a tyre lever as it was about 20 cms long and L-shaped). When he examined the breakdown kit two weeks later it was missing.14 Jovana Ljubojevic and Snezana Tankoska each said that they saw Duncan talking to Christina Kusonogovski in the car before Jason Kusonogovski, and the others, arrived at the Park. Jovana Ljubojevic indicated that she had previously known him through school friends, while Snezana Tankoska said that she had known him from primary school. Jovana Ljubojevic said that while Duncan was sitting in their car, Jason Kusonogovski came over and spoke to his sister. The next thing she saw was them whispering together outside the car and then walking towards the hut where the Sydney boys had gathered. She also said that she saw another Islander there, who the Crown asserts was Sione Amone who gave evidence of walking over to the car and speaking to Christina Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    15 Christina Kusonogovski said that, while she was sitting in the car with Snezana Tankoska, her brother Jason Kusonogovski came over. He asked her for some money, told her it was late, and added that she should be getting home. She agreed that Duncan had also come to the car and spoken to her, but could not remember what he had said.  
     
      
    16 Jason Kusonogovski said that he had walked to South Beach. He confirmed that he had received a phone call from Duncan. He told him that he was looking for his sister. Duncan said that she was at South Park. He denied that Duncan had made any mention of him needing to go down to the Park if he did not want his sister to “be raped by a pack of Lebos”. He said that he rang his sister who confirmed that she was at South Park and could give him $10. He obtained a lift from Alana Ljubicic who drove him to the Park. He said that it was after he received some money from his sister who was sitting in Jovana Ljubojevic’s Toyota Camry, that he saw Duncan. 
     
      
    17 Although there were some differences in the accounts given by the various witnesses who were present, the Crown contended that at least four cars containing the people from the party, arrived at the Park. Subject to some differences in recollection, it would seem that those vehicles included a red Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Alana Ljubicic, which also contained Jason Kusonogovski, Sione Amone and Carla Busuttil; the green Nissan Pulsar previously mentioned, driven by Oliver Gjoreski; a blue Ford Laser driven by Tracey Saye; and a red Ford Laser driven by Chi Tam Huynh (“Big Chi”). It does have to be acknowledged, as I have observed, that there were inconsistencies in the evidence concerning the occupants of the various cars when they arrived at the Park. For reasons that will become obvious, of more importance was the identification of their occupants when they left the park.  
     
      
    18 There was another group of people in the Park, although independently from those previously mentioned. They were Diana Petroska, Ahmed Kak, Joseph Mishawi and Lena Ivanovska, who had travelled there in Mishawi’s Honda.  
     
      
       
      The Taking of Mathew Michael’s Phone 
       
      
    19 Mathew Michael said that as he walked away from the Sydney group to take a call on his mobile telephone, he was approached by two men (Duncan and Kusonogovski), who he described, respectively, as “Islander looking” and as “Yugoslavian or Serbian”. The latter man, he said, asked if he knew a girl Christina, and indicated that he was her brother. Michael said that the man of Islander appearance grabbed his phone and put it in his pocket. Words were exchanged including a description of the Sydney group as “fucking lebs”. He asked for the return of his phone. 
     
      
    20 Daniel Wilson said that when he heard Mathew Michael asking for his phone to be returned he went across, with Homeh and Beiruti, to see what was occurring. He saw two men standing near him, one he thought to be of Samoan or Islander appearance, and the other to be either Australian or Croatian. One of the men, who he thought to be the Samoan, whistled, after which they both walked down towards the car park. He saw about 20 “guys” waiting down there.  
     
      
    21 He said that after the man of Samoan appearance whistled, his brother Christopher joined his friends. There was swearing and words were exchanged from both sides.  
     
      
    22 Mathew Michael also said that the two men made off for the car park at some speed. They were followed by himself and his friends. He heard the Islander (Duncan) whistle to another group of males who then emerged from the car park. He estimated them to number about 15 people. 
     
      
    23 He similarly said that it was at this stage, that Christopher Wilson rejoined them. He said that he saw the Islander place the phone in a red Lancer. He heard someone from the Wollongong group, also of Islander appearance, scream, “let’s fight one on one”. 
     
      
    24 Sione Amone confirmed that it was he who had made this observation although he said his suggestion had been addressed to Duncan, who he had observed being chased. On his account he said to Duncan “why don’t you fight him one on one?” Snezana Tankoska also identified Amone as the speaker. She thought that the words had been directed at the person who was later attacked; while Carla Busuttil thought they had been directed by Amone to Duncan. Alana Ljubicic said that she saw Amone approach the ethnic looking group who had been chasing Duncan, and heard him tell them to fight “one on one”.  
     
      
    25 Jovana Ljubojevic also described hearing an argument over a phone, and seeing Duncan and Kusonogovski running from the hut and being followed by the Sydney boys down towards the car park. She also recalled hearing Duncan whistle.  
     
      
    26 Snezana Tankoska provided a similar account, and said that she had been able to recognise a number of the people who had gathered in the area where the two groups come together, including Sione Amone, Jap, Big Chi, Elbert Jose and Jason Kusonogovski.  
     
      
    27 Steven Siljanoski acknowledged seeing Duncan walking back towards the car park followed by some males, and also recalled hearing someone calling out “give me back my phone”.  
     
      
    28 Hayley Girgin who was still seated in Big Chi’s red Laser, described hearing someone calling out “give my phone back” followed by Sione Amone saying “Do you want to fight one on one?” 
     
      
    29 Jason Kusonogovski gave an altogether different account. He said that after getting some money from his sister he walked up the hill towards the group of men in the hut, followed by Duncan. Once there he said he was surrounded by these men, one of whom grabbed his shirt. He introduced himself as Christina’s brother, and said that he did not “want any trouble”. They asked him why he had walked up to them and whether he “wanted to start anything”. He repeated that he did “not want any trouble” and walked off. He said that they then pursued him back down the hill. He claimed not to see what Duncan was doing. He said that he walked across the car park and past Alana Ljubicic’s car and then hid where there was another hut and some bushes.  
     
      
       
      The Red Lancer is Driven Furiously Around the Park by Duncan 
       
      
    30 Alana Ljubicic said that Duncan made his way back to her red Lancer, and clambered into the driver’s seat after instructing her to move over. He began to drive the vehicle around the Park at speed, and in different directions, while, according to her, the other guys were trying to smash it with bottles.  
     
      
    31 She said that he had driven her car toward the lagoon, and then over towards the Novotel, and had been swerving the vehicle in an attempt to avoid the bottles. After parking the vehicle, she said, he got out and walked away.  
     
      
    32 Steven Siljanoski similarly said that when Duncan got into the car, it was surrounded by six to seven men of Lebanese appearance, who started smashing it with bottles. It was because of this, he said, that Duncan had driven it forwards and backwards. Sione Amone however said that Duncan had jumped into the car after being chased by three guys. He did not recall seeing any bottles being thrown at this vehicle at that stage, and confirmed that he saw Duncan swerving the car towards the people who had been pursuing him.  
     
      
    33 Mathew Michael, Snezana Tankoska, Hayley Girgin, Carla Busuttil, Freda Iordanidis, Zoran Mitic, Jovana Ljubojevic, and Sione Amone all confirmed that it was Duncan who had climbed into, and driven the vehicle around the Park after he had been pursued back to the car park by the Sydney group. They described him driving towards people, swerving in their direction and, on Mathew Michael’s account, doing wheelies, burnouts, spins and reversing the vehicle, causing people to jump out of the way.  
     
      
    34 Daniel Wilson and Tughlet Homeh each described having to move to avoid being struck. Homeh admitted to having smashed a bottle on the vehicle. He also thought that Daniel Wilson had thrown a bottle at it.  
     
      
    35 Snezana Tankoska said that Duncan brought the car to a stop near the entrance to the cricket oval. Zoran Mitic said that while Duncan had been driving the car backwards and forwards, bottles were being thrown at it, and it was being struck by someone with a wheel brace. Steven Siljanoski also described seeing people surrounding the car and hitting it with bottles before Duncan drove it away. He lost sight of him after he stopped the car. Freda Iordanidis also said that she saw the man who had been arguing with Duncan “smashing at” the Lancer. At that point she said Big Chi told Jose Elbert to move his car away. Jose then took his car down near the Lagoon.  
     
      
    36 Oliver Gjoreski said that it was shortly after Duncan had looked into the boot of his car, that he saw him returning to the car park area followed by six more men of Lebanese or European appearance. He heard an argument about a phone and saw Sione Amone trying to settle things down. Then he said that bottles started to be thrown on the road. Next, he said, Duncan got into a red Lancer, which he quickly accelerated and reversed. He also said that a scuffle was taking place at the time between the various people who had gathered near the car park. At that point, he said, he yelled out to his friends “hurry up. Let’s go”. Zoran Mitic and Siljanoski and another male, who had a bleeding hand, jumped into his car and he then drove off.  
     
      
    37 Anthony Quach similarly said that he heard yelling about a phone and saw people coming down the hill. He heard Alana Ljubicic scream at someone to get her out of her car, which was being driven backwards and forwards, while it was being hit with bottles and a wheel brace. It stopped eventually on the lagoon side of the park.  
     
      
    38 Hayley Girgin said that while Duncan was driving the car around the park, she walked across to Tracey Saye’s blue Laser. She noticed Sione Amone and Adam Perre also standing there.  
     
      
    39 Tracey Saye said that after seeing Paul Duncan being chased down the hill by a group of ethnic people, and hearing yelling about a phone, she saw a group of people gathering in a horseshoe at the back of Alana Ljubicic’s car and heard Sione Amone saying words to the effect “we don’t want a brawl, just one on one”. It was then that she saw Duncan driving Ms Ljubicic’s car, while the Lebanese group threw their bottles and pieces of wood at it.  
     
      
       
      The Fight Erupts 
       
      
    40 It is convenient first to note the evidence of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    41 Daniel Wilson said that after the red Lancer was driven away, he saw a man of Asian appearance (on the Crown case Chi Tam Huynh or “Big Chi”) open the boot of a vehicle and pull out machetes, baseball bats and trolley poles. At that point “all hell broke loose”. He said that he threw a bottle that he had in his hand toward the crowd, and together with his friends he ran up towards the hut pursued by the Wollongong group.  
     
      
    42 He also said that when the weapons were produced, he heard one member of the Wollongong group yell out “you Lebbos – get out of here”. He said, as did Mathew Michael, that as his group ran away, the victim Christopher Wilson became separated from the others. He was next seen by him to have been caught up near the barbeque area, where he became the victim of a savage attack, being struck with a machete and other implements, repeatedly to the head and body. He was also kicked and punched.  
     
      
    43 Mathew Michael said that after the red car had stopped driving around, he saw a group of young men coming towards his group with weapons in their hands, which he described as machetes, club locks, bats and wooden poles. He saw Beiruti being kicked and punched. He said that his group ran back towards the huts and the Lagoon Restaurant. When they arrived they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing.  
     
      
    44 He then described seeing an Asian man beating a man down, and other people hitting and kicking him. They were about 100 metres away. The man striking the victim on the head, he said, had a wheel brace in his hand.  
     
      
    45 Paul Beiruti also described seeing a large group of males approach them from the car park. He said that he fell to the ground and was kicked, punched and hit with a baseball bat carried by an Asian guy. He saw one male with a wheel brace. He managed to get away and to join his friends. He added that when they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing, his group armed themselves with garden pickets and ran back to where they had last seen him. He acknowledged having used one of these pickets to strike the rear window of the red Lancer. He identified, via some photographs, the injuries which he sustained.  
     
      
    46 Tughlet Homeh said that, after hearing Mathew Michael ask for the phone back, and hearing the Islander who had been arguing with him whistle, he saw about eight men walking towards them, with other males jumping out of cars. He said that Beiruti dragged him out of the way of the red Lancer as it was heading towards him. It was being driven, he said, by the Islander who had whistled. After hearing another Islander suggesting that they fight one to one, he noticed weapons being taken from the cars, including the club lock and a spanner. The islander had the club lock and the Asian had the spanner. The man with the club lock he said was not Sione Amone.  
     
      
    47 He said that, when his group began to run back towards the car park with the garden poles, the other group drove off in their cars. When he reached the car park he noticed the victim lying on the ground and he heard a girl crying.  
     
      
    48 On the following night he made an identification, from a group of photos, of the man who had whistled and had driven the red Lancer. He made a further identification on 20 April 2002. The Crown concedes that it was Sione Amone that he identified. On its case that had been a mistaken identification of Duncan. Each of these men was in fact of Islander appearance.  
     
      
    49 Jovana Ljubojevic said that after she heard Mathew Michael requesting the return of his phone, and Duncan whistle, she and the victim had left her car and made their way towards the hut. About half way there she saw her friends running towards the car park. It was after Duncan had been driving the red car around, that she saw “Jap” (Chi Bin Nguyen) take a machete out of the boot of the car. She said that she saw him swing the machete at the victim. The next thing she saw was the victim surrounded by a group of people who were armed with bats and poles. She said that she only recognised “Jap” who, at this time, had a metal pole, which he was using to hit the victim over the head repeatedly. Others in the group she said were also hitting him with poles and a bat before walking away. Three of them however came back and kicked him a few more times before leaving. 
     
      
    50 Snezana Tankoska also said that she saw “Jap” swing a machete at the victim, who ran towards the shed near the old restaurant, but was struck down before he got there, being surrounded by twenty or so people who were hitting and kicking him.  
     
      
    51 Christina Kusonogovski said that when she saw people running around and fighting, she moved away from the cars over towards the Novotel. The next thing she noticed was Jovana Ljubojevic’s car being smashed.  
     
      
    52 It is next convenient to deal with the evidence of the Wollongong group who had been at the party.  
     
      
    53 Sione Amone said that Big Chi took a machete out of the boot of his red Laser and gave it to Jap. At that point, he said, he tried to take the machete off Jap to stop him, succeeding only in cutting his finger. The injury he said was attended to by Tracey Saye, who had a beach towel in the back of her car. He said that he then remained near the car with Tracey Saye and Carla Busuttil.  
     
      
    54 He also said that he saw Duncan and the others chasing “a guy” back towards the barbeque area. He next saw a person on the ground with three or four persons standing over him, and hitting him with something. He recognised that the persons included Big Chi, Jap, and “some of the Massos” (Macedonians and Serbians). He agreed that he had not noticed anything in Duncan’s hand while he had been chasing the guy. He said that he saw another man, who he thought was Zelco, with a metal bar and Big Chi with a baseball bat running behind Jap.  
     
      
    55 He described seeing Duncan, Big Chi and Jap up in the area where the Sydney group had left their cars, smashing those cars. Although he said in chief that Duncan was kicking the cars, in cross-examination he withdrew that answer. He said that he, along with Carla Busuttil and Jason Kusonogovski, jumped into Alana Ljubicic’s red Lancer and left. As they did so the rear window was smashed after being struck twice. Duncan, he said, was standing near the other vehicles when they left.  
     
      
    56 He acknowledged having been charged over the assault, but said that the charge was later withdrawn. He admitted having told the police a lie about not having been to the park, when interviewed by them, and having offered Carla Busuttil as an alibi witness. The reason he said was because he was scared and wanted to stick up for his friends. 
     
      
    57 However, on 6 November 2001, he spoke again to police and provided answers to questions concerning the events in the park. He acknowledged having told police a lie on this occasion in so far as he had explained the cut on his finger as having occurred when he pushed out the broken rear window of Alana Ljubicic’s car, because he did not think they would have believed that it occurred when trying to disarm Jap.  
     
      
    58 Carla Busuttil said that she also saw Duncan running up towards the grassed area, chasing some people, after bringing the red Lancer to a stop.  
     
      
    59 She then saw “Big Chi” open the boot of his red Laser and take out a machete which he gave to “Jap”. They then ran off towards the grassed area. Elbert Jose moved Chi’s car, as did Alana Ljubicic. Carla said that she walked over to where Ljubicic’s car was parked. She saw people fighting in the grassed area, using pieces of wood or sticks, and kicking a person on the ground. She saw Jap swinging the machete in the air as he ran towards the grassed area. After that she got into Alana Ljubicic’s car together with Jason Kusonogovski and Sione Amone. 
     
      
    60 While Alana Ljubicic was yelling out for Duncan to join them, she saw that there were four people left in the grassed area: the victim who was lying on the ground, Duncan, Big Chi and Jap. Jap was hitting the man with the machete, Duncan was punching him and kicking him in the stomach, and then, on her account, he took the machete from Jap and struck the victim with it. The next thing she saw was Big Chi smashing windows of the cars and jumping on top of them. He was joined by Jap who also kicked and struck the cars. He was later joined by Duncan who similarly struck the cars. Big Chi ran to his red Laser, followed by Jap and finally by Duncan. The driver she said was Elbert Jose. As Ljubicic’s vehicle drove off it was struck from behind by someone, shattering the rear window.  
     
      
    61 Similarly to Amone, she acknowledged having given police a false account when interviewed by them on 3 November. On 5 and 25 November she provided further information to police in the form of an interview and statement, which she said had been truthful. Although she did acknowledge giving an explanation to the effect that the cut on Amone’s finger occurred while he was washing up, she said that at the time she had believed this to be the case, as she had seen him cut his hand on a broken glass in the sink.  
     
      
    62 She acknowledged having been Sione Amone’s girlfriend as at 2 November 2001, and said that their relationship was continuing. She denied that Amone had been involved in the fight, saying that he had remained with her between the time that he had told Duncan to fight them “one on one” until they had left the area.  
     
      
    63 She also denied having placed Duncan in the place of Amone in relation to the fight, and confirmed that Amone’s clothes had not been covered in blood. She had initially lied to police, she said, because she had been confused and scared of getting Amone and herself into trouble and of dobbing other people in.  
     
      
    64 Hayley Girgin also described seeing “Jap” with a machete in his hands, standing beside the man on the ground, along with eight or ten men who were kicking and hurting him, although in cross-examination she appeared to be less certain as to what precisely was occurring. She said that she did not recognise the people involved other than Jap.  
     
      
    65 She also gave evidence of Sione Amone receiving assistance for a cut to his hand. Additionally, she said, she had not seen him involved in any of the fighting.  
     
      
    66 Tracey Saye said that after Duncan had driven off in the red Lancer, she saw Sione Amone come over to her car with a cut on his hand. She took an old beach towel out of her boot and wrapped it around his head. While the boot was open, she said, Adam Perre came over, and took from it a wooden leg, which she had previously broken off from a “For Sale” sign. He then ran over to where the fight was taking place. She said that she heard people yelling and screaming and saw Perre hitting the boy on the ground with the piece of wood that he had taken from her car “like a cricket bat – just hitting.” 
     
      
    67 She said that she had not seen Duncan at the park after he had earlier got into Alana Ljubicic’s car and driven off in it. When that vehicle later drove off she confirmed seeing the boys of Lebanese appearance hitting it with bottles and sticks.  
     
      
    68 She agreed that she had not seen any blood on Duncan’s person or clothing at the house when the Wollongong group later gathered.  
     
      
    69 It was her evidence that she had driven Hayley Girgin, Adriano Karuso, Adam Lamacchia, and Anthony Quach from Stuart Park.  
     
      
    70 Although Alana Ljubicic initially said in chief that she had not seen Duncan after he had left the car, when she was cross-examined by the Crown by leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act, she acknowledged having told police (Detective Pamozzo) on 3 November 2001 that she had seen a number of fights breaking out in which Duncan and Jap had been involved. She said that what she had told police would have been true, although she did not now remember it.  
     
      
    71 In cross-examination she indicated that she could not fix any particular fight in which Duncan was seen by her to be a participant. Rather she was referring to the whole situation, pointing out that she had not actually seen the assault on the young man who was injured.  
     
      
    72 She also said that she sat in her car, which she had moved back from where Duncan had left it, while the fight was occurring. She recalled seeing Duncan jump into Big Chi’s car, which then drove off. Sione Amone, she said, got into her car together with Carla (Busuttil) and Jason Kusonogovski. As they were leaving, someone smashed the back window of her car. Sione Amone, she noticed, had cut his finger. He explained that he had been trying to take the knife off someone.  
     
      
    73 Jason Kusonogovski denied being involved in the fight that left the victim injured. He said that, while hiding on the other side of the park, he could hear yells and swearing and saw people running around but could not otherwise see what was happening. He eventually went back to Alana Ljubicic’s car and asked her to leave the area, as he was scared. She drove off. He was sitting in the back seat when the window was smashed by someone with a pole. He confirmed that the other occupants were Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone.  
     
      
    74 Steven Siljanoski said that after Duncan stopped the car “everything was just mayhem” with people running around and ending up on the grass near the beach. He remained near Gjoreski’s car, hiding behind it. He initially said that although he saw someone on the ground being hit with branches and perhaps a pole, he did not recognise any of the members of the group of three or four persons. He also said that when Oliver Gjoreski called out that it was time to go, he and Mitic jumped into Gjoreski’s car, followed by someone he did not know who had blood on his fist. As they left he saw Big Chi smashing one of the vehicles of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    75 He was cross-examined pursuant to leave given under s 38 of the Evidence Act and admitted to having made a statement to police, which he agreed he had read before signing it, and which he also agreed had been made to the best of his knowledge at the time.  
     
      
    76 In that statement, he accepted, he had told the police that he saw Duncan and Perre in the group of men who were hitting and kicking the victim. He said that he had seen someone with blonde hair in the group, and according to him the detective asked him if that had been Adam Perre. That led him to ask if Perre had blonde hair? The detective, he said, replied in the affirmative, even though Perre had black hair. He had also said that he had to wear glasses when he drove and that he could not see 100 percent.  
     
      
    77 When asked at the trial as to the extent of his knowledge of Perre, he said that “he didn’t really know him but he just knew the name.” He would not say they were friends but he “knew who he was”.  
     
      
    78 When cross-examined by defence counsel he reverted to saying that he could not now be certain that Duncan and Perre were members of the group who were attacking the victim.  
     
      
    79 Zoran Mitic said that he had been taken to the park in Oliver Gjoreski’s green Pulsar, and had hidden behind Oliver Gjoreski’s car while Duncan was driving the Lancer around. When he re-emerged he saw a man on the grass up near the beach being kicked and punched, but could not recognise those involved. He said that he left the area in Gjoreski’s vehicle, with Steven Siljanoski and someone else who he did not recall, who was holding his hand. They drove to the JJ Kelly Park. There, he said, he saw Duncan.  
     
      
    80 There was no suggestion made of Duncan having phoned him for a lift from the park, or of him driving Duncan away.  
     
      
    81 Oliver Gjoreski said that when he saw people scuffling and bottles being thrown, and the Lancer driving around, he called out to Mitic and Siljanoski “hurry up, hurry up, let’s go”. They joined him in his car, followed by someone who was dark, and who had blood on his hands, whom he did not know. He knew Duncan who had driven from Elbert Jose’s party to the park.  
     
      
    82 The person with blood on his hand, who got into this vehicle, the Crown asserted, was Adam Lamacchia.  
     
      
    83 Elbert Jose who acknowledged having had a fair bit to drink, said that he had been sitting in Big Chi’s car, sleeping while the fight occurred. He acknowledged hearing bottles breaking and people yelling. When he was woken up, he drove Big Chi’s vehicle toward the Novotel but then got out and someone else drove. He recalled its occupants being Big Chi, Frieda Iordanidis, Adam Perre and another person who he could not recall. He claimed not to have seen Duncan at the park or in the car.  
     
      
    84 Frieda Iordanidis said that after she noticed “Big Chi” smashing a car, she asked Elbert Jose to drive his car back to pick him up. She said that Big Chi, “Jap” and Perre got into his red Laser, in which she was sitting, followed finally by Duncan. Jose drove part of the way and was then replaced by Big Chi as driver. Alana Ljubicic also said that she saw Duncan jump into Chi’s car as she left.  
     
      
    85 Anthony Quach said, in cross-examination, that at the time that the two groups were yelling at one another and after the Lancer had been driven around, he saw people getting “stuff” out of the boot of a car, including a wheel brace.  
     
      
    86 Iannis Mellos said that he had not been involved in the fight, but indicated that he had seen “Jap” fighting a man.  
     
      
    87 Finally, reference may be made to the group of people who had not been to Elbert Jose’s party and who had independently arrived in the park.  
     
      
    88 Joseph Mishawi did not identify any of the assailants, but confirmed seeing someone being hit on the grassed area with poles by about three people. They then ran past his car. The next thing he saw was a red car leaving.  
     
      
    89 Ahmed Kak said that he had arrived in the park at about midnight with Joe (Mishawi) and Lena Ivanovska, and Diana. While they sat in Mishawi’s car, he noticed a “couple of guys” who looked like Syrians and who were screaming and swearing, kick and hit the red Lancer. He said that people inside that car, who he described as Asians, got out of the car with metal poles and chased the Syrians or Lebanese back towards the beach. One, he said, was too slow and was caught. He was then hit with poles, and hit and kicked by four or five men while he was on the ground. This continued for 3 or 4 minutes. One of the girls with them he recalled, was saying “stop, stop hitting him”.  
     
      
    90 Diana Petroska also described ten or more people bashing a man on the ground with poles, over the grassed area on the beach side of the park. One of these people she recognised as “Jap”, who she knew from school. This, she said, followed her observation of a red Lancer being driven around, and of people moving out of its way.  
     
      
    91 Lena Ivanovska gave a somewhat similar account of an attack taking place after the red car had been driving around, making turns and doing burnouts and skids. She was unable to see precisely what then occurred, but recalled seeing men with sticks and poles and then seeing people crowded around a man on the ground. She said that she was scared and tried to avoid looking.  
     
      
       
      The Fight Ends

    93 There was general consensus among the witnesses in this respect, save for the fact that Tracey Saye alone said that Adam Lamacchia left in her car. Hayley Girgin said that she saw him leave in the red Laser. Tracey Saye’s evidence in relation to Lamacchia was not supported by the other occupants of her car, namely Girgin, Quach, Mellos, while Karuso, who said that he was asleep, had no memory of driving away.  
     
      
    94 Daniel Wilson said that when he realised that his brother was not with their group, he went back looking for him and saw him lying on the ground. Before doing so he dug out a wooden stake that was supporting a small tree. He did not, however, get to use the stake, because there was no one there to use it on. He noticed a couple of men walking away. After going over to assist his brother who was lying in a pool of blood he noticed Beiruti and Michael screaming and throwing things at the red Lancer (of Ljubicic) as it drove off.  
     
      
    95 Mathew Michael also said that when they realised that Christopher Wilson was missing and was being beaten, he and the others in the group took up garden pickets and started to run back towards the incident. It was at that stage that the Wollongong group ran towards their cars, but not before the man with the wheel brace and another man smashed the windows of his vehicle and that of Jovana Ljubojevic’s father. He acknowledged that his friend Paul Beiruti hit the back widow of the red Lancer, with the stake which he was carrying, before it left the area.  
     
      
    96 Tughlet Homeh said that the red Lancer whose rear window was smashed was the last vehicle to leave the scene.  
     
      
    97 Snezana Tankoska said that when she attempted to place a call for an ambulance on her mobile phone, someone who she did not see, who she thought was Nanad Radavassovic, but who the Crown asserts was the Appellant Perre, asked “who are you calling?” He then punched her to the face, cutting her lip and knocking her to the ground. She said that after getting up and placing a second call for help, she also noticed “Jap” smashing Jovana Ljubojevic’s car and “Big Chi” smashing Mathew Michael’s car. The last car that left the area, she said, was the red Lancer. One of the Sydney boys threw something at it, as it left, breaking the rear window.  
     
      
    98 Jovana Ljubojevic said that she raised the head of Christopher Wilson who was bleeding badly and having trouble breathing, and asked someone to call for an ambulance. She also said that she had earlier begged “Jap” to desist but that he and the others had refused, returning several times to resume their assault. One of these people told her, at one stage to “fuck off”.  
     
      
    99 She added that, while she was endeavouring to assist the victim, she looked up and saw Jap smashing the side windows and windscreen of her car.  
     
      
       
      The Wollongong Group Meet After the Fight 
       
      
    100 After the incident, most of the members of the Wollongong group drove to the JJ Kelly Park, a five minute drive away. While there, according to Tracey Saye, the Appellant Perre said that he had hit one of the girls in the face. She said that he was drunk and had blood on the top of his creamy coloured pants.  
     
      
    101 From this park a number of people moved on to FJ’s place in Lake Heights (premises owned by Sione Tuifua, a cousin of Sione Amone). Perre was driven there in Tracey Saye’s car. She had in her car, additionally, Hayley Girgin and Adrian Karuso. 
     
      
    102 Hayley Girgin said that, during the drive, Perre boasted of beating the victim and punching the girl. He told Hayley Girgin: “I was hitting him with a stick, the stick kept breaking into pieces, so I pick the pieces up and kept hitting him”. He also said that a girl was trying to stop him so he “punched her out”, causing her to fall to the ground.  
     
      
    103 Tracey Saye said that he made a similar admission to her, about hitting the victim with the stick, which broke into pieces, which he used until he had nothing left. Additionally she said that, at the JJ Kelly Park, he mentioned hitting one of the girls in the face.  
     
      
    104 Hayley Girgin said that she noticed that Perre had a cut on a knuckle, and blood on his creamy colour trousers. Carla Busuttil also said that she noticed that his hand was swollen and recalled him mentioning that it was “sore”. 
     
      
    105 Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin gave evidence of driving Perre home from FJ’s place. Tracey Saye said that she told him that he would be in a lot of trouble for this incident. His response was “I hope it’s worth it then”. She said that he had been very drunk.  
     
      
    106 Hayley Girgin also recalled him saying: ”I don’t want to go inside. I have blood on my trousers. My mum will get angry. How am I going to get it off? It is not my blood. I think it is the guy on the ground’s.”  
     
      
       
      The Findings at the Crime Scene 
       
      
    107 The ambulance officer Anthony Ryan who examined the victim said that he had six to seven head wounds, with exposed brain tissue emerging from one wound. He had severe swelling to one of his eye orbits and welt marks to the legs, as well as a partially severed finger. 
     
      
    108 Police and ambulance officers including Senior Constable Weir who came to the victim’s assistance said that they found him being cradled by Jovana Ljubojevic, and that they observed, in the immediate vicinity, 6 pieces of broken timber, some 3 metal star pickets, and a chrome coloured metal wheel brace with fresh blood on it.  
     
      
    109 Detective Sergeant Doherty who carried out a crime scene examination recorded that the pieces of wood, which were bloodstained, bore fine impact splatter. The six pieces of wood could be rejoined to make a stake. On the face of two of the broken sections of the stake there were screws consistent with it having been part of a ‘For Sale’ sign.  
     
      
    110 He also gave evidence of finding bloodstains on the exterior and interior of the red Mitsubishi Lancer, particularly in the rear of the vehicle. Nothing of significance was found in the blue Laser, of Tracey Saye. He also gave evidence of finding a sheath for a machete, but not the machete itself.  
     
      
    111 Regrettably, due to resource limitations, not all of the crime scene exhibits were tested for fingerprints or for DNA. However, as emerged from the evidence of Detective Sergeant Doherty and Virginia Friedman, DNA evidence was obtained showing matching profiles, according to the Profiler Plus system, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) the profile of the swab from the exterior of the red Lancer of Alana Ljubicic matched the profile of Sione Amone.  
       
       
      (ii) the profile of two swabs from the interior of that vehicle matched the profile of the victim, Christopher Wilson. 
       
       
      (iii) the partial profile of a sample from a Magnalite torch recovered from the red Laser of Chi Tam Huynh could have come from the victim; 
       
       
      (iv) A profile of a swab from one of the car seat covers from the red Laser matched that of the victim; 
       
       
      (v) Other swabs from this vehicle threw up a mixed profile, for which Chi Tam Huynh could have been a contributor; 
       
       
      (vi) the profile from staining on Chi Tam Huynh’s trousers matched that of the victim; and  
       
       
      (vii) the profile from the staining on the blue board shorts of Duncan matched that of the victim.  
       
      
    112 Detective Sergeant Doherty said that a tubular steel wheel brace was found some distance from the area where the victim was found, but the testing of it was negative for blood. No L-shaped tool was found at the scene.  
     
      
    113 He said that he examined a pair of trousers that had been seized from Chi Tam Huynh’s home, which were found to have staining on the front of one leg.  
     
      
    114 Detective Sergeant Doherty also gave evidence of a comparison which he made between the linear patterned abrasions to the back of Paul Beiruti and the stained area on the leg of Chi Tam Huynh’s trousers, and which revealed a sufficient similarity for the conclusion that the weapon which had caused Beiruti’s injuries had caused the staining on these trousers.  
     
      
    115 He also gave evidence of a cream pair of cargo pants having been found in the plastic bag, which contained the blue shorts of Duncan. They had some stains on them, but that was not tested for DNA, by reason of the positive testing which had been conducted on the shorts. Detective Sergeant Panozzo confirmed that Duncan’s fingerprints were found on the red Lancer.  
     
      
    116 Dr Duflou gave evidence based upon the medical records (without having examined the victim) to the effect that, if the wheel brace had been used to strike his head, in the right orientation, it could have produced the four injuries that were represented by lacerations in the shape of incomplete circles. He said that it was unlikely that the circular head wounds had been caused by shoes. He could not say whether the pieces of timber, or the machete, had caused these head injuries. He did say that a number of the other lacerations to the back of the head and to the face could have been caused by kicking or stomping, or by the victim having been struck with pieces of wood or a baseball bat.117 The victim was hospitalised between the time of the attack and his release on 19 January 2002. He suffers permanent disability, arising from the comminuted fracture of the left parietal and occipital bones, the fracture of the right parietal bone, the underlying haematoma and bruising, and the diffuse axonal injury which was occasioned. He has ongoing and permanent lost of visual function, reduced memory and learning capability, slowed thinking and motor responses, and is at increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. 
     
      
    118 On any view, the behaviour of those involved in this wanton and vicious attack on a young victim who had done nothing, at any stage of the evening to provoke them, was utterly appalling. Their attack was vicious. It was brutal and cowardly, and not one of those involved is entitled to regard the evening as involving a shred of “honour”. 
     
      
      Perre’s Subsequent Accounts of the Incident and the Evidence in his Case 
       
      
    119 On the day following the incident Perre attended work at the Leisure Coast Garden Centre. A work colleague, Simon Baker gave evidence of noticing that he smelt of alcohol. He also noticed that he had a gash on a knuckle of one on his hands, which had been a little swollen in the morning but progressed as the day went on. Perre was holding it as if it was sore. When asked how his night out had been, Perre replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I beat up some Lebo from Campbelltown. I had a me[t]al pole and my mates had machetes.”  
        
       
       
      He went on to say, according to Mr Baker: 
       
       
        
        “When I woke up in the morning I had blood all over my pants and all over my bed sheets. There was so much blood. I kept hitting him. I think I may have killed him.” 
        
       
       
      He also said, according to Mr Baker, that he was not sure how he had injured his knuckle, observing, “I think I might have been hit with one of the machetes.” Mr Baker added that he had said that he kept hitting the man in the head with the pole.  
       
      
    120 Perre was interviewed by Police, in the presence of his father on 12 November 2001, at a time when he was not a suspect. He said that he had been pretty drunk, and had not seen what happened, although he did acknowledge hearing shouting and the smashing of bottles and glass from the other side of the driveway, and seeing a few punches being thrown. He denied assaulting anyone.  
     
      
    121 When he arrived at the Park, he said, he had felt sick and had vomited. He said that he had experienced trouble focussing. He claimed to have seen someone having “a go” at Michael Gaspari, and had walked over to pull Gaspari away. He said that he and Gaspari had stayed behind the cars until it was all over. He had then jumped into the red Laser, in which he said there was Elbert Jose and Freda Iordanidis and Chi. He added that someone else got into the back of the car behind him, but he did not know who it was, as “I didn’t really look at him. I was, like sleeping, just put my head back”. He said that while Jose had begun to drive the vehicle, he was replaced as driver by Chi.  
     
      
    122 He acknowledged being taken home by Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin, but claimed to have kept to himself at the house to which they had gone on the way. He claimed not to have had much recollection of the night. 
     
      
    123 He informed police that he had worn “light greeny-brown coloured cords” and a black skivvy on the night of the incident. Later that day he took to the police station a pair of light green corduroy trousers, a pair of white joggers, and a black skivvy. 
     
      
    124 On 15 November 2001 he was arrested and on that occasion he declined to be further interviewed in relation to the attack on Christopher Wilson, or the assault of Snezana Tankoska. On the following day an order was obtained for him to provide a buccal swab.  
     
      
    125 Hayley Girgin said that the clothes which he claimed to have been wearing were not the clothes that she had seen him in that night, recalling that he had in fact worn cream coloured pants and black leather shoes.  
     
      
    126 Perre gave evidence at the trial, in the course of which he said that he could not recall who had driven him from Elbert Jose’s party to Stuart Park. It was while he was vomiting, he said, that he could hear screaming, shouting and bottles breaking. At that stage, he said, he felt scared. He could see people over the hill and he walked over, and joined his friend, Michael Gaspari, when he saw a man walking towards him and yelling “come on. Do you want to go. Let’s go”. He thought this man was going to punch Gaspari so he went over to help and pulled him away. 
     
      
    127 He said that he had then hit the other man in the mouth, cutting his knuckle. He said that he returned to where the cars were parked on the mountain side of the driveway and stood behind them. He saw a red Laser approach. When it stopped he jumped in. The vehicle, which was being driven by Elbert Jose, waited for someone else, and then left the area. He acknowledged that its occupants included additionally Freda Iordanidis, Big Chi and someone else who sat on his right. Big Chi he recalled, took over driving from Elbert Jose.  
     
      
    128 He denied making the admissions which had been attributed to him by Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin and Mr Baker, although he acknowledged that he had informed the latter that he had been in a fight with “Lebbo’s from Sydney”. He had said that, he explained, because he had heard Anthony Quach mention it at FJ’s house. He maintained his account of having worn the green corduroy trousers and white joggers and denied that they had received any blood stains. He said that the injury to his knuckle had bled overnight leaving some little spots of blood on his pyjama pants and doona. He denied hitting anyone with a stick or using any other weapon. He also denied having taken a piece of wood out of the boot of Tracey Saye’s car, or having struck Snezana Tankoska in the face. He denied seeing any weapons but acknowledged that Tracey Saye had driven him home.  
     
      
    129 His mother gave evidence to the effect that he had in fact been wearing white Nike shoes and fawn/beige coloured corduroy trousers. She added that she had not noticed any blood on his clothing. She did however say that when she washed his sheets she noticed a spot of blood on the doona cover. 
     
      
    130 Both she and Perre said that his black school shoes had been thrown out before the incident. 
     
      
    131 The Appellant called two character witnesses Ronald Sattin and Garry Norris. 
     
      
       
      Duncan’s Account of the Incident and the Evidence in his Case  
       
      
    132 Duncan presented himself to police on 5 November 2001, with his girlfriend Sheree Machan. He took part in an ERISP in the course of which he said that he had arrived at the park, merely in the course of driving around Wollongong, on the night of the incident, in the blue Honda Civic of his friend Zoran Mitic. He denied having anything to do with the fight, or having taken the mobile phone of Mathew Michael. He claimed to have been near the car in which Christina Kusonogovski had been sitting when the fighting broke out, to have seen two Asians “Vim” and “Huy” at the scene and to have seen Asians running down the hill. He denied hearing Amone make any mention of fighting “one on one”, and he denied whistling to the other people who had come to the park. He said that he observed the Asians and Serbs fighting, and asserted that it was the Serbs who had weapons in their hands and that he had been pursued by one man with a bat.  
     
      
    133 He said that he had been chased over to Alana Ljubicic’s car and had driven it off in an attempt to get away. He explained the subsequent manoeuvres as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I reversed it that way, and then went out the no entry way, and then people were still running towards me for that way, I turned around because I tried to get out of there…” 
        
       
       
      He said that he got out of the car when Alana Ljubicic said that she wanted to go home. He said that he then phoned Zoran Mitic from his mobile to pick him up and added that Zoran took him home in his car, along with Mitic’s cousin. He denied getting into Big Chi’s car or leaving the scene with him.  
       
      
    134 He denied having been to Jose’s party that night, or having phoned Jason Kusonogovski. On his account he had seen him for the first time that night as he was walking across to speak to his sister, shortly before the fight broke out. He said that the injuries, which had been occasioned to his knuckles, had occurred as the result of his use of a punching bag at his kickboxing class. He did acknowledge having spoken to Christina Kusonogovski with her brother, but said that he had not realised that she had been there until Jason Kusonogovski arrived. He also said that, while he had been driven away from the scene, he had not gone on to Lake Heights. He denied leaving the scene in the red laser which took Big Chi and Perre from the scene.  
     
      
    135 He also nominated as being present at the scene apart from the brothers “Vin” and “Huy”, another man whose nickname was Zelks (who no one else noticed) and a man Nanad.  
     
      
    136 After being interviewed, and placed under arrest, he was taken to his home by police while they made a search. The search and some further questions were video taped. Present at the home at the time were his mother and his girlfriend, Sheree Machan. During the search he identified the clothes which he claimed to have been wearing on the night of the incident.  
     
      
    137 Sheree Machan, who was called in the Prosecution case, said that before driving Duncan to the police station that morning, she had collected some of his clothes from the floor, because they looked dirty. She said that she had placed them in a plastic bag which she then left in her car. It had been her intention to wash them. She indicated that she usually washed his clothes on a daily basis. After the house had been searched she allowed police to search her car, as a result of which they found and examined the bag of clothes. They included the pair of blue board shorts previously mentioned, which had a red staining, the analysis of the DNA of which was found to be consistent with that of the victim. Inside the rear pocket of these shorts, police found a mobile phone Sim card belonging to Mathew Michael. There was no issue in the case concerning Duncan’s ownership of these shorts, trial counsel having expressly accepted that to have been the fact.  
     
      
    138 An attempt was made to organise an identification parade, but that did not proceed when a group of young Islander males who had been contacted, refused to assist. When an attempt was made to reinterview Duncan on 28 November he exercised his right not to be interviewed. It was then that he was arrested.  
     
      
    139 Duncan did not give evidence. He called Linda Machan, the mother of his girlfriend, who said that she had spoken to Sione Amone on the Monday following the offences, and had been told by him that he had cut his hand when trying to get the machete off Jap, that the blood of the victim, over whom he had been standing, “went all over me”, and that he had disposed of his clothes that night. Her daughter Sheree Machan gave similar evidence. Although leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine Sheree Machan, she denied having made up her evidence. She did, however, accept that she had initially lied to police in relation to her assertion that the clothes in the car had belonged to her brother.  
     
      
    140 There was no evidence presented at trial from Chi Tam Huynh, Chi Binh Nguyen, Adam Lamacchia, or Michael Gaspari, each of whom was convicted and sentenced for offences arising out of the night’s events. Nor was there any evidence from the two girls who were taken to the park by Oliver Gjoreski, but whose identities were unknown. 
     
      
    141 There was, however, some evidence from a man Nanad Radavassovic to rebut a suggestion that he may have been the person who struck Snezana Tankoska and the person to whom Duncan had referred. It was his uncontroverted evidence that he had been at work for the entirety of the night, and had been uninvolved in any of the events at the park. In reply, however, the defence contended that it was not Nanad Radavassovic who Duncan had in mind but someone else altogether known as Nennard. 
     
      
       
      B. THE BASIS ON WHICH THE CROWN CASE WAS PRESENTED 
       
      
    142 It was the Crown case that Jason Kusonogovski had not been telling the truth, and that while Steven Siljanoski and Alana Ljubojevic had initially told the police the truth, in relation to the fight, they had dishonestly attempted in the witness box to retreat from their original position.  
     
      
    143 Otherwise it put forward the various witnesses who were called in its case as credible witnesses, and offered as an explanation for any discrepancies, or lack of observation, the traumatic and rapidly unfolding nature of the night’s events, or alternatively the fact that they focussed upon only a part of what was occurring.  
     
      
    144 The prosecution case was based upon joint enterprise depending upon Perre and Duncan having personally inflicted the relevant injuries or having encouraged or assisted others to do so, with the intention, in each case, of occasioning that victim grievous bodily harm. Extended joint enterprise was also relied upon in so far as the Crown contended, in the alternative, that the two Appellants were parties to a joint enterprise to assault the victim, and contemplated the possibility of grievous bodily harm being occasioned to him. 
     
      
    145 It was its case that Kusonogovski and Duncan were not impressed by the fact that the sister of the former had met up with the Sydney group in the park, that a fight with them was contemplated, and then provoked by the two of them and particularly by Duncan when he took Mathew Michael’s phone, and effectively whistled up the members of the Wollongong group, whose presence had already been encouraged, for assistance. It was its case that Duncan added to the provocation for a fight by placing the stolen phone in the red Lancer and then deliberately driving it at the various members of the Sydney group.  
     
      
    146 The Crown asserted that there was a considerable body of evidence which excluded the defence proposition that it was Sione Amone, rather than Duncan, who had been the Islander involved in the fighting. The one obstacle in the way of that submission, it accepted was the finding of blood, the profile of which was consistent with that of the victim in the red Lancer in which Amone was driven from the park. However it also pointed to the presence in the vehicle, at that time, of Jason Kusonogovski, who on its case was one of the persons who effectively provoked the incident.  
     
      
    147 Otherwise it relied upon the individual strands of evidence, which will be referred to later in these reasons, to establish its case against each Appellant.  
     
      
       
      C. THE DEFENCE CASES 
       
       
      Perre 
       
      
    148 It was his case that each of Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin, Steven Siljanoski and Simon Baker were either liars or the subject of fallible or false recollections, and as such were neither credible or reliable witnesses. In particular, reliance was placed upon what was said to be inconsistencies in their accounts over time.  
     
      
    149 It was also submitted that the Crown had incorrectly cited the transcript in support of the reasons which were advanced by it for proof of its case; that there was no independent forensic evidence linking him to the attack. Reliance was placed on the absence of any witness asserting that they saw blood on the Appellant’s clothing at FJ’s house, other than Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin, who on the defence case had an interest to serve, in protecting Sione Amone; as well as the absence of any witness other than Tracey Saye saying that they saw Perre remove a piece of wood from the boot of her car; and additionally, the absence of any independent support from the other occupants of the car in which Perre was taken to FJ’s place, for the admissions which Hayley Girgin said that he made on the way there, or for the admissions which Tracey Saye said he made at the JJ Kelly Park, or at FJ’s place, or back outside his own home.  
     
      
    150 Reliance was also placed (as was the case in relation to Duncan) on the evidence of Snezana Tankoska and Jovana Ljubojevic which, it was suggested, pointed to there having been another Islander, “James”, at the scene, that is, an Islander other than Duncan and Amone, as well as a man Zelco who some witnesses nominated as having been present. These persons were not identified and not called, leaving open the possibility, so it was put, that they had been involved.  
     
      
    151 Moreover, it was submitted that the evidence of the mother of this Appellant contradicted any evidence concerning the sighting of the blood on his clothing, or admissions to that effect attributed to him.  
     
      
    152 Further, it was submitted that Siljanoski’s evidence was not to be accepted, in view of the contradictory accounts which emerged during the cross-examination pursuant to leave given under s 38, and the evidence which he offered concerning his eyesight, which is considered in more detail later in these reasons, since it is of relevance for the ground of appeal which is pursued in that respect.  
     
      
    153 Emphasis was given to the inevitable problems of identification in a setting that was dark, when it was raining, and when there was a great deal of activity taking place. Reliance was also placed upon the evidence that was available to the Appellant of prior good character.  
     
      
    154 An alternative hypothesis was said to remain open in relation to the injury to Perre’s hand, referable to him having suffered a cut to the knuckle when punching the man who, on his account, he believed to be posing a threat to Michael Gaspari.  
     
      
    155 It was contended that Tracey Saye was not a credible witness, suggesting that she had fabricated aspects of her account. Simon Baker was also suggested to have made up aspects of his account, for example in relation to the Sydney boys having come from Cabramatta, and in relation to Perre’s reported use of a metal pole, neither of which accorded with known facts. The submission was made that his evidence was based not upon any conversation with Perre, but rather from what he had learned from the media or other sources.  
     
      
       
      Duncan 
       
      
    156 Counsel for this Appellant accepted that he had participated in the night’s events to the extent of phoning Kusonogovski, talking to his sister, taking Michael’s phone and provoking what followed by that action, and also by driving the red Lancer in a somewhat dangerous manner. However, it was the defence case that this is where his involvement stopped, and that he did not become party to any joint enterprise of the kind asserted by the Crown, or become personally involved in any attack on the victim.  
     
      
    157 Considerable emphasis was placed by the defence upon the problems of identification in the circumstances of this night, and upon the proposition that by the time he had been pursued down the hill and driven Alana Ljubicic’s Lancer away, no weapons had been produced by members of the Wollongong group. This, it was contended, pointed to the absence of any knowledge, or expectation, on his part, of there being an altercation in which any of the Sydney group would be attacked and weapons used against them.  
     
      
    158 The driving away of the vehicle, and the manner thereof, it was contended, was attributable to fear and panic on his part to make an escape.  
     
      
    159 Further, it was submitted, in relation to Gjoreski’s evidence that no tyre lever or implement, of the kind that he said had gone missing from his tool kit, was found at the scene; and that it was somewhat improbable that the Appellant would have come to his vehicle seeking a weapon, before he had spoken to Christina Kusonogovski. A possible answer, for Gjoreski’s evidence, counsel suggested, was a desire to write himself out of the scene, it being implicit in this submission, despite the complete absence of evidence suggesting that Gjoreski had been involved in the fight, that he had in fact been one of the offenders.  
     
      
    160 A similar submission was advanced in relation to Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone, in so far as it was submitted that they were placing Duncan in Amone’s place. There was an associated submission that having regard to the physical likeness of these two men, a question arose as to identification. Reference was also made to the evidence of Snezana Tankoska and Tughlet Homeh which was suggestive of a third Islander, “Jamie”, or “James” having been observed in the park, adding to the risk of misidentification.  
     
      
    161 Reliance was placed on the fact that several witnesses described seeing Duncan in jeans. No one mentioned seeing him wearing the board shorts which were found to have the blood stains, and which he had allowed his girlfriend to collect and take away to be washed. Counsel did not offer any explanation for the presence on the shorts of a small amount of blood of the victim, but did question whether, if Duncan had been involved, there would not have been a good deal more blood upon them. The risk of contamination with other exhibits or of manipulation occurring, was somewhat obliquely suggested, although there was evidence that the shorts had been separately bagged.  
     
      
    162 The finding by police of the SIM card in the shorts was also questioned, it being asserted that it would have been somewhat unusual for the card to be kept and not the phone if that had been stolen by Duncan.  
     
      
    163 It was asserted that the jury would not accept that Siljanoski’s statement to police (in relation to the telephone call from Duncan to Kusonogovski) was correct, in the light of his evidence at trial concerning the making of that statement, it being contended, in effect, that the police had out of zealous enthusiasm, inserted their words into the document rather than his. Reference was also made to his asserted eyesight deficiency and uncertainty in relation to the identification of the co-accused Perre, so as to weaken his evidence.  
     
      
    164 An argument was advanced that Jovana Ljubicic, who knew Duncan and others from the Wollongong group, could however be trusted, and that it was significant that, even though she was very close to the fight, the only person she could identify as a participant was Jap.  
     
      
    165 Defence counsel accepted that he had lied in the ERISP, including, she suggested, that he had scripted Sione Amone out of the scene in order to protect him, but suggested that he may have responded differently had he been aware that he was facing the present charge rather than that of assault, in respect of which he was arrested.  
     
      
       
      THE SENTENCES PASSED ON OTHER OFFENDERS 
       
      
    166 Sione Amone was initially charged upon the basis of the identification made by Tughlet Homeh which was later accepted as having been mistaken. The charges against him were then withdrawn. 
     
      
    167 Chi Binh Nguyen (Jap) who was 19 years old at the time of the offence, and who had a prior record for violence, including an offence for which he had been on conditional liberty, pleaded guilty, at his arraignment on 6 February 2003, to the same s 33 offence, to affray, and to two counts of malicious damage to a motor vehicle. He was given a discount of 25 per cent for the plea, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years for the s 33 offence, and was given terms of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months for the malicious damage charges, and a fixed term of 2 years for the affray offence. The sentence for the s 33 offence was cumulative upon the non-parole period for the malicious damage offences. The overall sentence was therefore one of 14 years and 3 months with an overall non-parole period of 11 years 3 months. 
     
      
    168 Chi Tam Huynh (Big Chi) who was 18 years of age at the time of the offence, and who had a prior history of malicious damage and of affray, pleaded guilty, just prior to the commencement of the trial, to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (s 35 Crimes Act), and to one count of malicious damage to a motor vehicle (s 195(a) Crimes Act). A form 1 matter was taken into account of having a prohibited weapon. He was additionally sentenced for a separate offence namely the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug (s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). 
     
      
    169 He was given a discount for the plea of 25 per cent, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years for the s 35 offence, with a non-parole period of 4 years, and to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years for malicious damage. A sentence of 3 years was imposed for the drug offence, and the sentence for the s 35 offence was made cumulative upon that sentence by 1 year in round terms. The overall sentence was accordingly one of 8 years, in round terms, with a non-parole period of 5 years.  
     
      
    170 Adam Lamacchia also pleaded guilty shortly before trial to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Wilson, contrary to s 35 (1)(b) of the Crimes Act, an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years, and to affray. He had been aged 18 years at the time of the offence and had no prior record of violence.  
     
      
    171 He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the s 35 offence, and to a s 9 bond for 4 years in relation to the offence of affray. 
     
      
    172 Michael Gaspari later pleaded guilty to one count of affray. He was sentenced by Phelan DCJ to an unconditional s 9 bond for 2 years. 
     
      
       
      D. PERRE’S APPEAL 
       
      
    173 Perre has raised the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “GROUND 1. His Honour’s discretion miscarried and he was wrong to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness Siljanoski in relation to that witness’s visual identification of the Appellant because he failed to consider s 114 of the  
        Evidence Act. 
         
         
        GROUND 2. The trial miscarried because his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to lead the inadmissible evidence of visual identification of the Appellant by Siljanoski. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    174 The Appellant also applied for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
        GROUND 3. His Honour was in error not to take the intoxication of the Applicant into consideration as going to the degree of deliberation involved in the offence. 
         
         
        GROUND 4. His Honour failed to take into account, properly or at all, the youth and good character of the Applicant or that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. 
         
         
        GROUND 5. His Honour was in error not to have found special circumstances. 
         
         
        GROUND 6. The sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    175 Before dealing with these grounds it is convenient to note that the case against Perre  primarily rested upon: 
     
      
      (a) Tracey Saye’s evidence of him taking the wooden leg from the boot of her car, and striking the victim, while he was lying on the ground “like a cricket bat, like just hitting – just hitting”. 
       
       
      (b) The admission which Tracey Saye, and Hayley Girgin said that he made to them, to the effect that he had hit the victim with a stick that kept breaking into pieces, which was consistent with the six bloodied pieces of garden stake that were found at the scene. 
       
       
      (c) The observations of Tracey Saye and Hayley Girgin as to the presence of blood on his cream pants, and the admission which he made to Hayley Girgin as to his concerns about going home with blood on his trousers, which he thought had come from the “guy on the ground”. 
       
       
      (d) Snezana Tankoska’s evidence of being punched by a man while she was phoning for help in circumstances where no other female who was present that night said that she was struck and where Perre had admitted to Hayley Girgin and to Tracey Saye that he had struck a girl. 
       
       
      (e) The presence of a cut and bruised knuckle on his hand that was seen by Simon Baker, Hayley Girgin and Carla Busuttil.  
       
       
      (f) His admission to Simon Baker of beating up “some Lebo” and hitting him with a pole. 
       
       
      (g) His false claim to have worn the green corduroy trousers on the night of the assault, which he produced to police. 
       
       
      (h) His attempt to minimise his participation in and recollection of, the nights’ events, under a veil of intoxication. 
       
       
      (i) His presence with the other principal offenders in the red Laser of “Big Chi” which took them from the scene, that being a vehicle in which blood was found having a profile that matched that of the victim. 
       
       
      (j) Steven Siljanoski’s account to police as to having seen Perre in the group of men who were striking the victim. 
       
       
      APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 -  
       
       
      Ground 1: His Honour’s discretion miscarried and he was wrong to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness Siljanoski in relation to that witness’s visual identification of the Appellant because he failed to consider s 114 of the  
      Evidence Act. 
       
        
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried because his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to lead the inadmissible evidence of visual identification of the Appellant by Siljanoski. 
       
      
    176 These are obviously overlapping grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    177 There were two witnesses who were relied upon by the Crown as having identified Perre as one of the attackers: Tracey Saye and Steven Siljanoski. 
     
      
    178 The identification by Tracey Saye was positive and unequivocal, and she was a person who had known him before the incident. Although there was an attack made upon her credit, she remained unshaken and was obviously accepted by the jury. His Honour gave a sufficient direction in relation to visual identification evidence, and no point is taken upon appeal in relation to this aspect of the case.  
     
      
    179 The appeal is, accordingly, concerned with the evidence led from Steven Siljanoski, in particular as to whether leave should have been given to the Crown, under s 38 of the Evidence Act, to cross-examine him, and as to whether there had been compliance with s 114 of the Evidence Act. That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Exclusion of visual identification evidence 
         
         
        (1) In this section:  
         
         
        visual identification evidence 
         means identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw but does not include picture identification evidence. 
         
         
        (2) Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:  
         
         
        (a) an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or 
         
         
        (b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or 
         
         
        (c) the defendant refused to take part in such a parade, and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant. 
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court in determining whether it was reasonable to hold an identification parade, it is to take into account:  
         
         
        (a) the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned, and 
         
         
        (b) the importance of the evidence, and 
         
         
        (c) the practicality of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things:  
         
         
        (i) if the defendant failed to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure, and 
         
         
          
          (ii) in any case—to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence, and 
          
         
         
        (d) the appropriateness of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the defendant and the person who made the identification. 
         
         
        (4) It is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade if it would have been unfair to the defendant for such a parade to have been held. 
         
         
        (5) If:  
         
         
        (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade unless a lawyer acting for the defendant, or another person chosen by the defendant, was present while it was being held, and 
         
         
        (b) there were, at the time when the parade was to have been conducted, reasonable grounds to believe that it was not reasonably practicable for such a lawyer or person to be present, it is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade at that time. 
         
         
        (6) In determining whether it was reasonable to have held an identification parade, the court is not to take into account the availability of pictures or photographs that could be used in making identifications. 
         
        
       
      
    180 In order for this ground to be considered it is necessary to set out Siljanoski’s evidence in a little more detail, and to note what occurred at the trial in relation to it. 
     
      
    181 In chief, his evidence was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you recognise anybody that was hitting [the victim]? 
         
        A. Hundred percent sure, no. 
         
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know a person named Adam Perre? 
         
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long have you known him? 
         
        A. I don’t really know him, just know the name. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know him or not? 
         
        A. Well, I wouldn’t say I’m friends with him, I don’t know him, really spoken to him before, but like, I know who he is, but I don’t know – we have never really had a conversation together. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see, Mr Siljanoski, you have told the Court you already knew what Adam looked like before this night? 
         
        A. Yes, I knew what he looked like.” 
        
       
      
    182 The Crown then made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine him in respect of the inconsistent statements contained in a statement which he had made to the police on 29 November 2001. 
     
      
    183 The application was opposed. Counsel for the Appellant conceded that s 38 of the Evidence Act (“the Act”) applied but submitted that his Honour would not grant leave because of the provisions of s 192 (2)(b) of the Act. When asked by his Honour “what (other) provisions of the Act” were relevant, counsel replied, “No. Probably for the very good reason that none apply”. Counsel maintained that the effect of the evidence of Siljanoski was that “he didn’t really know” the Appellant, and it was upon that basis that leave to cross-examine him was opposed. 
     
      
    184 His Honour granted leave to the Crown to cross-examine Siljanoski and observed in his judgment “the evidence could be of crucial importance so far as the Crown case is concerned in respect of each accused”. In his judgment he referred only to ss 38 and 192 of the Act. 
     
      
    185 The Crown cross-examined Siljanoski who then gave evidence that he had made a statement to the police which contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “At that stage [Duncan] almost ran me over so I ran behind Ollie’s car. They must have done something like put the breaks [ 
        sic 
        ] on hard. They skidded and the bottles landed near me… [Duncan] must have got out of the car and went back to fight because I looked back towards where the fight was taking place and saw a group of 4 or 5 guys around maybe one guy. I saw [Duncan] was one of the guys in that group a guy I know as Adam Perre and others. They were hitting him maybe with a pole a branch… I yelled out… “Hurry up let’s get out of here”. I remember leaving, Ollie was driving. Zoran got in the front seat. I got in the back seat. We started driving off towards the south. At this time another guy, some other guy, ran up to the car jumped in behind Ollie’s seat.” 
        
       
      
    186 When Siljanoski was confronted by his statement to the police identifying the Appellant as one of the assailants, he said (T275.6): 
     
      
       
        
        “…when I made that statement I told – the detectives asked me, I said there was someone with maybe blond hair. He said “was it Adam Perre?” I said “I am not sure, does he have blonde hair?” And he said “Yeah he does and he was just arrested a day before that.” 
        
       
      
    187 Detective Senior Constable Worthington said, in his evidence, that he could not recall whether Siljanoski’s eyesight was discussed when the statement was being taken; whether Siljanoski had said there was a person with blond hair or whether Siljanoski asked him whether the Appellant had blond hair. It was his account that he typed the version which he was given on the word processor. What he was told he put into the statement.  
     
      
    188 The evidence of Siljanoski led through cross-examination by the Crown was obviously visual identification evidence falling within s 114(1) of the Evidence Act, and was inadmissible (R v Tahere 1999 NSWCCA 170) unless one of the three conditions referred to in s 114(2) had been met. No identification parade had been held and the Appellant had not been asked whether he would take part in one in relation to the investigation into either of the offences contained in the indictment. 
     
      
    189 There had however been a request made of him to participate in an identification parade in relation to the alleged assault by him of Snezana Tankoska which had occurred during the general incident at Stuart Park. The Appellant declined to participate in that parade. The identifying witness for that assault was not Siljanoski. The information relating to the request for and refusal of an identification parade for that assault was not placed before the jury. Nor was evidence led to show that it became necessary for police to obtain an order for him to provide a buccal sample for DNA testing, since he was not prepared to give his consent.  
     
      
    190 It was submitted that, upon the evidence, Siljanoski had been not been sufficiently familiar with the Appellant to conclude that it would not have been reasonable, on that account, to have held an identification parade. 
     
      
    191 While neither the Crown nor defence Counsel referred his Honour to the requirements of s 114, it is now submitted that, at the very least an inquiry should have been made by his Honour as to whether s 114 of the Act had been satisfied. 
     
      
    192 Reliance was placed on decisions of this Court in R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170 and R v Taufua NSWCCA 11 November 1996. Each is distinguishable. The critical finding in Tahere was that there was no evidence to show that at the time of the trial, or at a time reasonably proximate to the trial it would not have been reasonable to have held a parade. In the present case there was evidence of that kind available related to the earlier lack of co operation on the part of the Appellant.  
     
      
    193 Taufua was a case that was concerned with the application of s 114 in the case of an in-Court identification, and also with the question whether the witness had sufficient prior familiarity with the accused for the trial judge to have reached a conclusion that it would not have been reasonable to hold an identification parade. The present case is in a different position, since there was evidence available upon which such a conclusion could readily have been reached.  
     
      
    194 In summary there are obvious problems, in relation to this submission, in so far as:  
     
      
       
      (i) Experienced trial counsel did not take any objection at trial; 
       
       
      (ii) The evidence was capable of showing that Siljanoski already knew the Appellant;  
       
       
      (iii) Having refused an identification parade in relation to one aspect of the night’s events, it was virtually certain that any request to participate in a parade concerning the more serious charge would have been refused; 
       
       
      (iv) There was a considerable body of evidence, apart from that of Siljanoski to show that Perre had been actually engaged in the assault, not only from Tracey Saye, but in the form of the several admissions previously mentioned; and  
       
       
      (v) The Wollongong group which included Perre and Siljanoski had all come from the same party, with the result that Siljanoski would have been likely to have recognised him later that night. 
       
      
    195 The High Court in Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 199 ALR 547 pointed out that the provisions of the Evidence Act need to be assessed in the adversarial context of the trial. In a joint judgment Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at 20: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sections 114 and 115, like many other provisions of the  
        Evidence Act,  
        declare that evidence of a certain kind is not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Yet evidence of a kind to which those sections refer may not be the subject of objection. Counsel for an accused person may have any one of number of reasons for not objecting. A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire. Counsel might decide not to object simply because he or she knows that that accused, upon giving evidence, will admit that the identification evidence is correct. The  
        Evidence Act  
        applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection…”

    196 In the present case, had the absence of an identification parade been taken up by the defence, the Crown would have been entitled to lead evidence from Detective Senior Constable Audrey Pearson concerning the Appellant’s refusal on 15 November 2001 to participate in a parade, in relation to the assault of the female, an event which was very closely linked with the central events of the night. Having been refused once, police would have been reasonably entitled to assume that any further request would also be declined, particularly in view of the Appellant’s refusal to enter into an ERISP after his arrest, and the need for police to seek an order to obtain a buccal swab from him. 
     
      
    197 Absent any evidence from experienced trial counsel as to why the point was not taken, and given the appropriate directions that the jury received as to identification evidence generally, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Leave to argue this ground should, in my view, be refused. 
     
      
    198 For these reasons the appeal of Perre against conviction should, in my opinion, be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 
       
       
      Ground 3 - 
       
      His Honour was in error not to take the intoxication of the Applicant into consideration as going to the degree of deliberation involved in the offence. 
       
      
    199 His Honour noted the submission that he should find that the Appellant, whose role was assessed to have been among the most serious of the various offenders, had committed the offence because of his drunkenness and that this factor should have been treated as one operating in mitigation of sentence. He observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not convinced that any aspect of your account is true. 
        
       
       
        
        Anyway, intoxication due to alcohol consumption is, in view of the jury verdict, no excuse or mitigation. On the other hand, if all that is sought is an acknowledgment that you may on occasions drink too much and be better off not doing so, then I am prepared to make these findings.”  
        
       
      
    200 It was submitted that his Honour was in error to dismiss the question of intoxication out of hand since the degree of culpability of an offender may be influenced by the degree of deliberateness involved in an attack R v Sewell and Walsh (1981) 5 A Crim R 204, and this may in turn be affected by intoxication. 
     
      
    201 There was evidence to show that the Appellant had been affected by alcohol, coming not only from himself, but also from Tracey Saye. On the other hand as his Honour correctly observed, by its verdict the jury had been satisfied that he had not been so affected as to have lacked the specific intent required for the offence. 
     
      
    202 The deliberate and sustained nature of the conduct attributed to the Appellant, both in savagely beating the victim, and in punching Snezana Tankoska in order to stop her calling for help, and his apparent awareness of what had occurred as disclosed by the various admissions which he made to Tracey Saye, Hayley Girgin and Mr Baker after the offence, are inconsistent with him having been affected by alcohol to any great degree. 
     
      
    203 While it is correct that alcohol may tend to mitigate the culpability of an offender where it causes him to act out of character, or where it affects the deliberateness of his act (R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 417), the evidence in the circumstances outlined in this case, fell well short of this mark. At most this was a case of reduced inhibitions, without any suggestion of any decrease in the Appellant’s awareness of what he was doing. Alcohol is not a licence to commit crime: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381, at 387 per McTierney J, and it was obviously to that principle that his Honour was referring when he noted that intoxication “is no excuse or mitigation”. 
     
      
    204 I am accordingly not persuaded that his Honour’s findings were erroneous, or that any lessening in the Appellant’s culpability is to be attributed to the fact that he had been drinking alcohol before the attack. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 4, 5 and 6 -  
       
       
      Ground 4: His Honour failed to take into account, properly or at all, the youth and good character of the Applicant or that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence. 
       
        
       
      Ground 5: His Honour was in error not to have found special circumstances. 
       
        
       
      Ground 6: The sentence imposed by his Honour were [ 
      sic 
      ] manifestly excessive. 
       
        
       
      
    205 His Honour appropriately noted that there was nothing remarkable about the Appellant’s upbringing or background “except that he had achieved well in all areas”, and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. He continued “however in view of the objective facts of this matter, this aspect plays little significant role in the ultimate sentence”. 
     
      
    206 It was submitted that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence, which showed that the Appellant, who was aged just short of 18 years at the time of the offence, had a prior excellent character with a substantial history of employment and involvement in the community. In this regard it was the case that he had a supportive family, he had completed his HSC, he was undertaking a civil engineering course at a TAFE college, he had bright career prospects, and the offence was described by those who knew him as being out of character. He had no criminal antecedents, he was of above average intelligence, and he had excelled at soccer.  
     
      
    207 Properly understood it is obvious from the reasons for sentence, that his Honour accepted that the subjective circumstances of the Appellant were favourable, in these various respects, and that his observation as to there being “nothing of note” did not go beyond an indication that there was nothing adverse in his record. 
     
      
    208 Reliance was placed on the general principle exemplified in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 and R v C; R v S; R v T, NSWCCA 12 October 1989, that the youth of an offender will generally mean that less weight will be given to deterrence and more to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    209 This is, however, subject to the qualification that when the nature of the conduct includes extreme violence, or is akin to that which is more commonly expected of an adult offender, then the interest of rehabilitation has less significance: R v Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109, R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, and R v Voss (2003) NSWCCA 182. The principles referred to in these authorities were directly applicable in the light of his Honour’s finding, which was amply based on the evidence, that he had deliberately struck the victim with a piece of wood, several times, while he was being attacked by co-offenders with implements such as a machete, poles and a wheel brace.  
     
      
    210 There is a further qualification of particular relevance in this case, in so far as the fact of age becomes of less importance the closer the offender is to adulthood. The Appellant was born on 20 December 1983, and was therefore only months short of his eighteenth birthday at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    211 The case is one for which the observations of Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 are particularly apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of  
        Williscroft  
        [1975] VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, ie, coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.” 
        
       
      
    212 Although the Appellant was by no means a mature adult, he was no child. He knew well the grave seriousness of the violence to which he was a party.  
     
      
    213 It was also submitted that the sentence imposed was crushing and was outside the legitimate range for offences of its kind. In this respect, attention was drawn to the JIRS statistics, which suggest that both the sentence and the non-parole period were 50% higher than any sentence previously imposed upon an offender less than 21 years of age (the highest, albeit in a population of only 26 offenders, having been a head sentence of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years). 
     
      
    214 There is limited value in any comparison based on such a small sample, particularly when the statistics include cases displaying a wide range of objective and subjective circumstances; equally it is the case that only limited assistance can ever be attained by reference to individual cases of the same general type, involving other offenders, having regard to the fact that they form part of the range, and also having regard to the need to assume that they were correct: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43.  
     
      
    215 It does however remain necessary that consistency be achieved in sentencing R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174, and in this respect regard to the statistics, and to the cases that make up the range, can help, so long as the practical constraints mentioned are kept in mind. 
     
      
    216 In this instance reference was made to three s 33 cases that resulted in the victim sustaining a permanent and serious brain injury: R v Henderson NSWCCA 5 November 1997, R v McKnoulty NSWCCA 20 May 1998 and R v Sumea [2002] NSWCCA 271. In Henderson a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was imposed after a plea; in McKnoulty, after trial, a sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 13½ years was imposed; and in Sumea, a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed, following a plea. There were obvious differences in the objective and subjective circumstances in these cases, and in the result they provide relatively little assistance.  
     
      
    217 The s 33 offence in this case was of very great objective seriousness such that a condign sentence was called for, that reflected not only a significant punitive and retributive element for the serious and permanent brain injuries that were caused, but that also conveyed a substantial element of general deterrence.  
     
      
    218 Young offenders who elect to respond to any form of confrontation between different groups, need to understand, with crystal clarity, that sentences of imprisonment await those who cause the confrontation to be elevated to one involving extreme violence. Particularly is that so if they band together, in a brutal and cowardly pack attack with weapons, on a single unarmed and defenceless victim. 
     
      
    219 The present case falls precisely into that category, and it was in the upper range of seriousness. It was not a case where the Appellant has shown any remorse or contrition, having continued to maintain his innocence. While he is not to be punished additionally for going to trial, or for maintaining this appeal, or for his lack of contrition, on the other hand he is not entitled to claim any discount or mitigation, on either account. 
     
      
    220 The critical question for this aspect on the appeal, which is tied up with the next ground, is whether the sentence was so far above the range, having regard to the Appellant’s otherwise favourable circumstances, that some lesser sentence was warranted in law, and should have been passed: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    221 His Honour observed, relevantly for ground 5: 
     
      
       
        
        “I could find special circumstances on account of your youth and other matters, but because of the structure of the sentence I am about to impose, I see no reason to increase the period available for parole.” 
        
       
      
    222 Although this passage is somewhat opaque, it would seem that his Honour regarded the period for potential release on parole of 4 years to have been sufficient to accommodate the kind of post release supervision that would have been required to ensure the Appellant’s successful return to the community. 
     
      
    223 There can be no quarrel with such a conclusion particularly having regard to the fact that the Appellant was not shown to have any psychological condition, or problems with substance abuse, that called for particular attention, and also having regard to the current practice as to when effective supervision ceases. 
     
      
    224 The case was one where there were factors that could properly have been taken into account when setting the head sentence, which also fell into the category of circumstances that can qualify as special circumstances, such as the age of the Appellant, the fact that this was his first time in custody, and his good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    225 It was not obligatory for his Honour to have found special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1997: R v Holmes [2003] NSWCCA 258. 
     
      
    226 The existence of an undue readiness for this provision to be used, as a means of reducing an otherwise appropriate sentence, has been noted in decisions in this Court such as R v Fidow (2004) NSWCCA 172 that is, where they have already been given full weight when setting the head sentence. 
     
      
    227 What is of concern in the present case is whether any weight was given to the Appellant’s subjective circumstances at all, when the head sentence was determined, against which a non-parole period was fixed in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    228 I can see no error, whether latent or patent, in relation to the sentence for the affray offence.  
     
      
    229 I have however reached the conclusion that the sentence for the s 33 offence was so far outside a proper exercise of legitimate sentencing discretion, that his Honour could not have allowed sufficient weight to be attached to the favourable subjective circumstances of the Appellant. It is, a sentence that would all but extinguish his prospects of rehabilitation, and in this respect latent error has been established.  
     
      
    230 In my view the lesser sentence that was warranted was one of imprisonment for 13 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years. This involves a minor variation in the statutory ratio, but I am persuaded that special circumstances exist relating to the age of the Appellant, to the interest of securing his rehabilitation and to the fact that he is to serve a lengthy period of imprisonment.  
     
      
    231 I would propose, accordingly in the appeal of Perre, the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against convictions dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, but confined to the sentence for the count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
       
      3. Appeal in respect of the sentence for the s 33 offence allowed. 
       
      4. Quash the sentence for the s 33 offence and in lieu thereof the Appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years to date from 18 August 2003 and to expire on 17 August 2016 with a non-parole period set of 9 years to date from 18 August 2003, and to expire on 17 August 2012, that being the earliest day on which the Appellant would be eligible for release on parole. 
       
      
    232 I observe that in re-sentencing the Appellant, I have taken into account the additional material tendered which confirms the progress of the Appellant while in custody, and supports his favourable prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
       
       
      DUNCAN’S APPEAL 
       
      
    233 Duncan has raised the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “GROUND 1 His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine the witness Stephen Siljanoski pursuant to s 38 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        , in that the witness was not “unfavourable” within the meaning of the act particularly s 38(1)(b) and (c) and s 192 AND His Honour failed to consider s 135-7 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        with respect to this evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 2 His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of questioning of the Appellant in the search warrant video. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 3 His Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding the evidence of identification. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 4 His Honour erred in his directions to the jury regarding “lies”. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 5 His Honour failed to adequately direct the jury as to specific intent and the alternative to the first count on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 6 His Honour failed to direct the jury with respect to the evidence of Siljanoski. 
        
       
       
        
        GROUND 7 His Honour erred in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients of the offence (by leave).  
        
       
      
    234 Additionally Duncan has brought an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        a) His Honour made erroneous findings as to the objective circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        b) His Honour rejected or failed to adequately take into account the subjective findings favourable to the Applicant that were available and uncontested on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        c) His Honour failed to adequately consider the age of the offender and the evidence of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        d) It is submitted that His Honour should have found special circumstances within section 44 of the  
        Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 
        
       
       
        
        e) Parity. 
        
       
       
        
        f) The sentence imposed by His Honour was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    235 Again before dealing with the separate grounds of appeal it may be noted that the case against Duncan primarily rested upon: 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence which suggested a degree of hostility on his part towards the Sydney group, including the making of a phone call to Jason Kusonogovski, and his inquiry of Gjoreski as to whether he had a baseball bat. 
       
       
      (b) The presence of a wheel brace near the place where the victim was found, and his search of the boot of the vehicle of Oliver Gjoreski, and the fact that a brace which had previously been in the boot was later found to be missing, in association with the evidence of Dr Duflou that some of the injuries could have been caused by such an implement. 
       
       
      (c) The fact that he took Mathew Michael’s phone, the SIM card for which was found in his blue shorts, and that he initiated the confrontation which followed, by whistling up his friends, and by then driving around the Park in an erratic and dangerous manner. 
       
       
      (d) The observations of Sione Amone and Carla Busuttil of him chasing the Sydney group back towards the grassed area where the victim was attacked, and of him hitting the man on the ground. 
       
       
      (e) The description by Alana Ljubicic and Steven Siljanoski in their initial statements, and of Carla Busuttil of his involvement in the fight, and their observations of him punching and kicking the victim, and of hitting him with a machete. 
       
       
      (f) The presence of blood, the DNA of which was consistent with that of the victim, on his blue shorts. 
       
       
      (g) The damage which he sustained to his knuckles. 
       
       
      (h) The evidence of Freda Iordanidis, Carla Busuttil and Alana Ljubicic to the effect that the person who was seen by others to have been principally involved in the fight, re-entered the red Laser in which she was sitting, in the order of Perre, “Big Chi”, “Jap” and finally Duncan.  
       
       
      APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
       
      Ground 1 -  
       
      His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine the witness Stephen Siljanoski pursuant to s 38 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , in that the witness was not “unfavourable” within the meaning of the act particularly s 38(1)(b) and (c) and s 192 AND His Honour failed to consider s 135-7 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      with respect to this evidence. 
       
      
    236 It was after Siljanoski had given evidence at the trial that he had seen a group of people hitting someone on the grass, that he indicated that he “couldn’t be a hundred per cent sure who they were”, and that he had not recognised anybody who had been involved in the assault, that leave was given for him to be cross-examined under s 38 of the Evidence Act. He was then asked to read the relevant paragraphs in his earlier statement to police, which he agreed had constituted the account which he had given and which, he also agreed, had been true to the best of his knowledge and ability at that time. The relevant paragraphs in the statement so far as Duncan was concerned, were to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “At that stage Babe (the Appellant) almost ran me over so I ran behind Ollie’s car. They must have done some thing like put the brakes on hard. They skidded and the bottles landed near me. 
         
        Q. Would you read a little bit more slowly? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Babe must have got out of the car and went back to fight because I looked back towards where the fight was taking place and I saw a group of four or five guys around maybe one guy. I saw Babe was one of the guys in that group a guy I know as Adam Perre and others. They were hitting him may be with a pole, branch. I saw it had leaves on it, another pole. I also saw people kicking the guy that was on the bonnet. Ollie yelled out to me, in “Hurry up let’s go”. So I yelled out to Big Chi, “hurry let’s get out of here”. I remember leaving, Ollie was driving. Zoran got in the front seat, I got in the back seat. We started driving of [ 
        sic 
        ] towards the South. At this time another guy, some other guy, ran up to the car jumped in behind Ollie’s seat. Then we stopped and were looking back.” 
        
       
      
    237 His Honour decided, as clearly was correct, that the witness’ evidence at the trial, was at variance with his statement, and that the case came within “s 38(1)(c) and (e)” of the Evidence Act, the latter obviously having been intended by his Honour as a reference to sub para (b). The case was one to which decisions of this Court in Regina v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997 applied, and which permitted the contents of the earlier out of court statement to be received as evidence of the facts concerning the attack on the victim.  
     
      
    238 There was also a proper basis for the case to have been brought within s 38(1)(a), in so far as the evidence given in chief was unfavourable to the Crown, as this term has been judicially interpreted: R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 at 715, R v Velevski (No. 2) (1997) 93 A Crim R 420 and R v Lozano NSWCCA 10 June 1997. 
     
      
    239 Objection was taken to leave being given under s 192 of the Act, it being submitted, by reference to s 192(2)(b), that it would be unfair to the accused for such cross-examination to be permitted. His Honour did not overlook the need to give consideration to the matters referred to in s 192, as had been held necessary in Stanoevski v The Queen  (2001) 75 ALJR 454, Adam v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1537 and R v Fowler (2000) NSWCCA 142. It was however submitted that error arose in so far as insufficient attention had been given to the probative value and potential prejudicial effect of the evidence, so far as fairness under s 192(2)(b) was concerned. 
     
      
    240 It was submitted, on appeal although not at the trial, that his Honour should have additionally given consideration to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act before giving leave. 
     
      
    241 The principle basis of these submissions rested upon the proposition that the witness’ evidence was unreliable, as he had already indicated that he “could not see one hundred per cent” without glasses, and that he had been pressured by police into making the statement. The evidence which he gave in this regard, once leave had been granted, was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you told Det Worthington the things that appear in Paragraph 13 of your statement, that is right isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes, but there was something that I think he worded wrong, the way it came out on [ 
        sic 
        ] my mouth. Because I told him from the distance I was and my eyesight, I have to wear glasses when I drive, by the way, I could not see 100 per cent. And for some reason that is not in the statement. I did not know that until I went to the committal here I never got a copy of my statement as other people did.” 
        
       
      
    242 In cross-examination, he agreed that he had felt under pressure at the police station, that he had been embarrassed by having been visited by police at his place of work, and that what had appeared in his statement had been what the police officer (Det Worthington) had wanted to put down, and not what he had meant.  
     
      
    243 It was submitted that the overall weight and reliability of the statement was also weakened by the possibility that it had been based upon reconstruction after the event, from knowledge which had been later acquired, by the unfavourable lighting, and general confusion in the park, and by the distance between him and the fighting which was calculated to have been in the order of 20 metres, to the point where leave should have been refused under s 192 or the evidence otherwise excluded under ss 135 or 137. 
     
      
    244 There was evidence from Det Worthington denying that he had “composed words” for the witnesses. He said that his general practice was to include in statements that which he was told by witnesses. Additionally it was the case that Siljanoski acknowledged knowing Duncan, Big Chi, Little Chi and Sione Amone, and conceded, at one point, that his eyesight was “alright” for long distance. He said that he had been about 20 to 25 metres away from where the person on the ground had been struck, and was able to see the leaves on the branch that was being used by some of the attackers. Duncan was a solid man of Islander appearance who had been wearing a distinctive sleeveless T-shirt, and there was no obvious reason for the witness to confuse him with Sione Amone who had been excluded by the other witnesses. 
     
      
    245 Having regard to the remaining evidence and to the contemporaneity of the initial account, and the witness’ acknowledgement that the statement had been truthful to the best of his knowledge and ability at the time of its making, I am not persuaded that it should have been regarded as unreliable. 
     
      
    246 In any event, it is well established that the “unfairness”, with which s 135 and s 137 are concerned relate to the risk of the evidence provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or of it being given more weight than it truly deserves: R v Nguyen (2002) NSWCCA 342 at para 28 and R v Suteski (2002) NSWCCA 509 at para 116. The fact that the evidence may be weak, or the subject of challenge, is not of itself a ground for its exclusion: Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at para 51 per McHugh J. 
     
      
    247 Moreover, evidence of one witness’ identification may properly be taken into account in the context of the evidence as a whole: R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 at 196 and R v Rima (2003) NSWCCA 405. In the present case, there was evidence as to Duncan’s involvement from Alana Ljubicic, Carla Busuttil and Sione Amone. Additionally, there was evidence as to the presence of blood consistent with that of the victim on his shorts, and as to him searching for a weapon before the attack. 
     
      
    248 A reading of the examination in chief and the cross-examination shows that the witness Siljanoski was somewhat uncooperative, and was obviously attempting to avoid saying anything that would be harmful to the Appellants. In those circumstances the case bears some similarity to that which came before this Court in R v GAC NSWCCA 1 April 1997. In that case the fact that the witness’ memory or certainty as to events which he had recounted to police, soon after the relevant events, had only failed him at the critical stage, and the fact that he was available for cross-examination at the trial, were each taken into account in determining whether leave should have been given. 
     
      
    249 Clear directions were given in relation to visual identification evidence, both generally and specifically, and in considerable detail, in relation to the care which needed to be given in relation to Siljanoski’s evidence on that aspect of the case. The issues which arose in relation to s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act were essentially the same as those arising under s 192(2)(b), as was the case in Regina v GAC. Moreover the defence had ample opportunity to cross-examine him on the prior statement and to obtain answers which potentially assisted their case, subject of course to an assessment of their credibility.  
     
      
    250 No argument was advanced at trial to the effect that the use of the evidence should be restricted under s 136 to that which was permissible prior to the enactment of the Evidence Act. In any event no proper basis would have been established for such a restriction, since the out of court statement went directly to the events in question, was made shortly after their occurrence, and the witness was clearly being evasive and protective of the Appellants. This ground has not been made good. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 2 – HIS HONOUR ERRED IN PERMITTING THE CROWN TO ADDUCE EVIDENCE OF QUESTIONING OF THE APPELLANT DURING THE SEARCH.  
       
      
    251 A voir dire examination was conducted in relation to the admissibility of this evidence, which related to the questioning of the Appellant, in his bedroom, during the search of the premises where he lived. A video was tendered of this search and of the questioning that occurred.252 In the course of earlier questioning at the police station, the Appellant had said to police that he was wearing his jeans, a grey ""cut off like, top thing"", and the jacket and shoes that he was wearing during the interview. He said that the rest of his clothes were at his home and he agreed to let police search the premises for them.253 While he was in his bedroom, he pointed out the grey sleeved T-shirt, which was then taken into police custody, along with his jacket and shoes. The only part of the video recording objected to a trial was the following question and answer: 
     
      
        
       
        
        Kelly: “Who does the washing here?” 
         
        Duncan: “I do”.  
        
       
      
    254 That answer was relied upon by the Crown as a lie, in so far as Sheree Machan had given evidence that it was she who washed his clothing, on a daily basis.255 The admissibility of this portion of the conversation was challenged, at trial, and upon appeal, by reference to s 13 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        13 Admissibility of certain statements etc 
         
         
        (1) Any statement, confession, admission or information made or given to a member of the police force by a child who is a party to criminal proceedings shall not be admitted in evidence in those proceedings unless:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) there was present at the place where, and throughout the period of time during which, it was made or given:  
           
           
          (i) a person responsible for the child, 
           
            
             
            (ii) an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the person responsible for the child, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) in the case of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years—an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the child, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iv) a barrister or solicitor of the child’s own choosing, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the person acting judicially in those proceedings:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) is satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult from the place where, or throughout the period of time during which, the statement, confession, admission or information was made or given, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the statement, confession, admission or information should be admitted in evidence in those proceedings. 
            
           
          
         
         
        
       
       
        
        (2)... 
        
       
       
        
        (3)… 
        
       
      
    256 It was asserted that the requirement that the support person be ""present at the place"" where, and throughout the period of time during which, the Appellant's statement was made, meant that such person had to be physically located in the bedroom where the discussion took place.257 The video shows the Appellant speaking to police. It does not show the mother or the girlfriend at the time of this conversation, although it is evident from a viewing of the video as a whole that they were present in the dwelling which contained this bedroom.258 The house was small, there were only a few rooms, and there was not much space in the bedroom where the Appellant and police were standing. Detective Kelly said, on the voir dire, that his last recollection of the mother was of her standing in the corridor about 3 metres from where he and the Appellant stood. He was unable to say precisely where she was at the time of the particular question and answer.259 The Appellant propounded a test for the section as one which required the support person to be ""in a physical position to influence the questioning"". This involves something of an overstatement. I am of the view that the section should be understood in the way that was outlined by me in Regina v Phung and Huynh NSWSC 26 February 2001:  
     
      
       
        
        “34. It may be accepted that the purpose of the legislative regime, that now applies to the interview of children, and particularly those in custody following arrest, is to protect them from any disadvantage inherent in their age, as well as to protect them from any form of police impropriety. As to the former, what is required is compliance with the procedure laid down so as to prevent the young or vulnerable accused from being overawed by the occasion of being interviewed, at a police station, by detectives who are likely to be considerably older and more experienced than they are. 
        
       
       
        
        35. This principle derives from what was said by Lee J in  
        Warren  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 360; by Roden J in 
         Williams 
         NSW Supreme Court 9 August 1982; by Hunt J in 
         Cotton 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 593; by Carruthers J in 
         Dunn 
         NSW CCA 15 April 1992; and also by Hidden J in H (supra). 
        
       
       
        
        36. The role of the support person is to act as a check upon possible unfair or oppressive behaviour; to assist a child, particularly one who is timid, inarticulate, immature, or inexperienced in matters of law enforcement, who appears to be out of his or her depth, or in need of advice; and also to provide the comfort that accompanies knowledge that there is an independent person present during the interview. That role cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled if the support person is himself or herself immature, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the English language, or otherwise unsuitable for the task expected, that is, to intervene if any situation of apparent unfairness or oppression arises, and to give appropriate advice if it appears the child needs assistance in understanding his or her rights.” 
        
       
      
    260 These observations were cited, with apparent approval by this Court in Regina v Tang (2001) NSWCCA 210 where Greg James J, with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, said, additionally: 
     
      
       
        
        “58 It can be seen from the structure of the provision that it lays the onus entirely upon the Crown, should it seek to tender the material. The section, by providing the exceptions, provides circumstances in the absence of which the evidence must be, in law, rejected. Other provisions, eg., those in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act 1995 make further provision for the admissibility and inadmissibility of such material. My view of s. 13 is that for the Appellant to satisfy this court that, in the admitted absence of such a person as s.13(1)(as) refers to, there was a significant possibility the evidence would be rejected, merely requires the Appellant to satisfy us that there is a significant possibility, notwithstanding that the police were misinformed as to his birth date, that a judge would still reject the evidence. The judge is required to do that unless, even if satisfied there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult, only if that judge considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the evidence should be admitted. On consideration of such a matter, a judge would have regard to the history of provisions of this kind (see  
        Regina v. Aquilina  
        (1978) 1 NSWLR 358;  
        Regina v. Warren  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 360;  
        McKellar & Booth v. Smith  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 950;  
        Regina v. Cotton  
        (1990) 19 NSWLR 593;  
        Regina v. Dunn  
        (CCA, unreported 15 April 1992);  
        Regina v. H  
        (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 481;  
        Regina v. Phung & Huynh  
        (Wood, CJ. at CL, unreported 26 February 2001). 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        60 It must be noted that the law not only requires the affording of an opportunity to a child during an interrogation to exercise on proper advice the option to speak or remain silent, but to have that advice so as to give consideration as to whether, in speaking, they might produce an account which does not do justice to their position.” 
        
       
      
    261 It would normally be necessary for the support person to be within a sufficient proximity to provide the protection which the section contemplates. It would not be enough, for example, if the support person was allowed to speak to the suspect but then required to wait in the general office of the police station, while the suspect was interviewed elsewhere. Nor would it be sufficient if the interview was conducted wholly out of earshot of the support person, or in a language which the latter did not understand.262 In the present case, while it is clear that the support person was in the company, in a broad sense, of the Appellant, at all times, there was no evidence to show her precise location at the time of the relevant question and answer, or to show whether she was in a position to hear the conversation.263 The trial Judge found that, on the balance of probabilities, both the accused mother and Sheree Machan were in the house throughout the period of the search, and held that this was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Alternatively, His Honour held that if he was in error in this respect, then there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of the support person at the relevant time, and that the statement should be admitted into evidence, in accordance with s 13(b) of the Act.  
     
      
    264 A submission was developed to the effect that his Honour addressed the wrong question in so far as he focused upon the place where the search took place as distinct from the place where, and the time at which, the relevant statement was made. This involves something of a literal reading of the reasons, but whether His Honour erred in this respect or not, it remains appropriate for us to determine whether error occurred by reference to the issue which appropriately arose, that is, whether the support person was present at the place where, and at the time when, the relevant statement was made by the Appellant.  
     
      
    265 The onus of establishing admissibility rested upon the Crown. Absent proof of sufficient physical proximity at the time of the relevant question, it needed to rely on s 13(b). There was a strong argument available in the circumstances of a search which was being conducted, while those concerned were walking through a small house, and conversing briefly in a bedroom, which was barely large enough to contain the Appellant and the officers who were conducting and recording the search, that there was sufficient and proper reason for the absence of the support person in the immediate vicinity of that conversation. However, where the evidence which was to be adduced merely went to credibility, I am not persuaded that the second leg of s 13(b)(ii) was satisfied.266 That is not, however, a sufficient basis to quash the conviction. The evidence in question was of little moment in the entirety of the trial, as indicated by the fact that it was not the subject of mention in the summing up. I am not persuaded that its admission gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. If error occurred then the proviso applies. 
     
      
      GROUND 3 – His Honour Erred in His Directions to the Jury Regarding the Evidence of Identification 
       
      
    267 This ground essentially involves the assertion that his Honour failed to give a warning in relation to the evidence elicited from Siljanoski, in cross-examination, as one of the persons involved in the assault, when giving his initial statement to police.  
     
      
    268 The difficulty with this ground is that no additional direction was sought by counsel for Duncan at trial even though, at the request of counsel for Perre, a comprehensive direction was given in relation to the matters which may have rendered his identification of Perre unreliable. Many of those, for example, his distance from the fight, the poor conditions of visibility, his asserted eyesight problems, were common for each Appellant, and there is no reason to suppose that the jury overlooked those matters.269 There was an important difference between the appellants in so far as Siljanoski’s evidence at trial introduced some qualification as to the extent of his knowledge of Perre. He did not do so in relation to Duncan, who, it was common ground, had been well known to him and who had arrived at the park in the same motor vehicle.  
     
      
    270 The only direction that was sought by counsel for Duncan, in this respect, was to point out to the jury the fact that when giving evidence in chief, Siljanoski had not mentioned seeing Duncan in the group attacking the victim, that it was only in cross-examination that it emerged that he had given an account of seeing him in that group, and further, that he had given an explanation in that he wished to rectify what he had said in that statement.271 That this was the case could not have been other than crystal clear to the jury. There had been extensive cross-examination on the issue, and when dealing with the address of counsel for Duncan, his Honour reminded them that she had pointed out that Siljanoski had ""said that there were things in that statement that he'd never said, and she submitted that you would find that he was trying to put things right in the evidence that he gave to you.""  
     
      
    272 While it is the case that a recital by a trial judge, in a summing up, of an argument put by counsel cannot substitute for a caution or direction where it is required, a failure to deliver such a caution or direction does need to be considered in the context of the trial, and in particular in the context of what was obvious to the jury.273 Counsel, in this instance, was not seeking a direction or caution. At most, a comment was sought drawing a distinction between what had been said out of court and pre-trial, albeit in a context where counsel had been able to cross-examine the witness in a way that was favourable to his case, subject to the jury's assessment of the witness’s credibility.274 Moreover, this was a case where a comprehensive direction had earlier been given in relation to the way that consistency or inconsistency of account could be taken into account in judging witnesses. In my view, Rule 4 applies and leave should be refused to argue this ground.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 4 – His Honour Erred in His Directions to the Jury Regarding “Lies” 
       
      
    275 In relation to the topic of lies, his Honour gave the following general direction: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The next direction that I must give you is about  
        lies 
        . It has been part of the Crown submissions made to you that each of the accused has told lies at various stages, including lies to the police and, in the case of Mr Perre who gave evidence, lies in Court. You will make up your own mind about whether either of the accused was telling lies and, if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case, but I give you this morning, do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that is evidence of guilt."" 
        
       
      
    276 Thereafter, when dealing with the case concerning each accused, his Honour carefully pointed out that the lies which the Crown asserted that each had told went only to the credibility of the accounts which they had given in their ERISPs or, in Perre’s case, additionally in his evidence. In that respect his Honour also pointed out that Duncan's ERISP, having been tendered, was before them as his version of events.277 For example when dealing with Perre’s evidence of not having remembered things, and of being asleep in the car, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""They are matters concerned with, to a large extent, with aspects of Mr Perre’s credibility and your assessment of him in terms of whether he is telling the truth in the witness box. On those kinds of grounds alone, you would not convict Mr Perre of course, but they are matters to be taken into account in assessing whether you think he is telling you the truth about his movements and his actions on the night."" 
         
        
       
      
    278 In relation to the sixth reason advanced by the Crown in relation to Duncan, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" Item number six is Mr Duncan's version given to police in his interview, where the Crown says he lied. I have already given you a direction in respect of lies. If you find them in fact to be deliberate lies, and if you found that to be the only thing made out by the Crown, that in itself would not support a finding of guilt. But you have regard to all of the evidence in the case and all of the submissions made by the Crown."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    279 This then was a case where the Crown made it clear that it did not rely on lies, in either case, as consciousness of guilt, for which a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 would have been required. It specifically relied on lies only on as a matter that went to the credibility of the versions of facts put forward by the two appellants.280 The decision of the High Court in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 is pertinent. It was there held that an Edwards direction should only be given where the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt. When there is a concern as to the risk of the jury engaging in an impermissible process of reasoning, and of elevating lies which are relied upon as going to credibility alone, as matters going to proof of guilt, then, the Court held, the type of direction which was given in this case, should be given.281 In circumstances where His Honour underlined, on several occasions, that the prosecution relied upon Duncan's lies only as going to the credibility of his answers in the ERISP, where a Zoneff direction was given, and where no Edwards direction was sought at trial, this ground is without merit. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 5 – His Honour Failed to Adequately Direct the Jury as to Specific Intent and the Alternative to the First Count on the Indictment 
       
      
    282 This ground needs to be understood in the light of the entirety of the directions that were given in relation to intention, in relation to the way in which the Crown put it case on the principal count, and in relation to the statutory alternative of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (which was properly left having regard, for example, to Regina v King [2004] NSWCCA 20).283 Early in the summing up, his Honour gave some general directions in relation to the expressions ""maliciously"" and ""intentionally"". They were somewhat incomplete in relation to ""maliciously"", in so far as his Honour only said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Something is done maliciously, if it is done intentionally and without lawful excuse”.  
        
       
      
    284 Any inadequacy in this direction was however corrected when his Honour returned, a little later, to give a redirection concerning this expression.285 In relation to intention his Honour gave an entirely unexceptional direction, in so far as he explained that this word had its ordinary English meaning, and also explained how it was that intention could be inferred, or deduced, from the circumstances in which certain activities occurred. In the course thereof, his Honour made it clear that the Crown had to prove, in relation to Count 1, that there was an intention to occasion the victim grievous bodily harm.286 The elements for Count 1 were summarised by way of a direction that there were three elements to be made out beyond reasonable doubt: ""... that there was grievous bodily harm inflicted upon Christopher Wilson, that that was done maliciously, and that was done with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm."" 
     
      
    287 His Honour then moved on to the statutory alternative, explaining that it was also necessary, in order for this count to be made out, that the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of grievous bodily harm and malice, the only difference being that, for this count, the Crown did not have to prove the specific intent to do grievous bodily harm.288 Next, his Honour dealt with the joint criminal enterprise, both in its basic form and its extended form where the Crown relied upon common purpose.289 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The law is that where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. A joint criminal enterprises exist where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. 
         
         
        The understanding or arrangement need not be express. That means they do not have to actually say or write down anything expressing that agreement and its’ existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any particular time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit a crime."" 
         
        
       
      
    290 His Honour applied this principle to the present case, first in general terms, and then specifically in relation to the evidence. He began with the following directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has sought to rely upon two alternatives which are commonly referred to in a discussion of joint criminal enterprise. The first is this, if the agreed crime is committed by one or others of the parties to that joint criminal enterprise or if all played some part in committing that crime, then all parties are equally guilty of the crime, regardless of the part played by each in its commission. I will give you an illustration of that shortly. 
         
         
        The alternative aspect of it is this, where firstly instead of the crime agreed another crime is committed by one or other of the parties to that joint criminal enterprise or, secondly, all played some part in committing that other crime and, thirdly, where the Crown has established that the parties to that enterprise had contemplated that other crime as a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime, all parties are equally guilty of that other crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. It does not matter then that the crime committed does not correspond in every detail with that contemplated by the parties. What must be contemplated by the parties is the substantial risk, not merely a slender chance, that it will be committed."" 
        
       
      
    291 His Honour dealt with the element of participation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the crime charged itself or with knowledge that the crime is to be committed by intentionally assisting or encouraging another party to the joint criminal enterprise to commit a crime. The presence of a person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give  
        and 
         if required are sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participants in the joint criminal enterprise to commit a crime."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      Almost certainly the emphasised “and” in this passage was a mistype for the word “assistance”. 
       
      
    292 Some illustrations followed of joint enterprises which came into being spontaneously, or as a result of planning, in the course of which his Honour pointed out the ways in which the participants would become criminally responsible for the acts of those who were involved in the enterprise. His directions were explicit and correct.293 It was at this point that his Honour applied these directions to the first count in the present case, with an explanation to the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “You, if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of the offence, can come to a finding of guilt in respect of the first offence in the indictment by different ways. Firstly, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused personally and maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Chris Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm, that is by causing the injuries personally.” 
        
       
      
    294 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now where you have got a number of people attacking another it may be difficult to show on the evidence that any one particular person in the attack inflicted a particular injury amounting to grievous bodily harm and you might well be justified in taking that view in this case as to either of these accused. 
         
         
        There is then, and this is why the Crown relies on joint criminal enterprise, a different way in which you can come to a finding of guilt in this case in (sic) that is by finding beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was part of a group, some of whom individually or together, maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Christopher Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm and others who assisted or encouraged that to take place, knowing it is occurring, that is that grievous bodily harm is being inflicted or that it will occur. 
         
         
        There is the third possibility and that is much the same as in the second alternative I have just given you, but without the accused actually knowing that grievous bodily harm is being inflicted or will be inflicted, but having in contemplation that it may be occurring, it might be inflicted, or that it may occur, that it might be inflicted... 
         
         
        When you come to consider that possibility it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that the precise injuries actually inflicted were within the contemplation of the accused, but only to prove to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that it was within the contemplation of the accused that grievous bodily harm of some form might be occurring or might occur and you will remember what I said to you about grievous bodily harm, it is bodily injury of a really serious kind. So in order for you to find guilt on that basis it is not necessary for you to find that it was within the contemplation of either of the accused that Christopher Wilson suffer the precise injuries he did or necessarily to the extent that he did but, if you were to come to a finding of guilt on that basis, it is necessary that you find beyond reasonable doubt that it was within the contemplation of either of the accused that bodily injury of a really serious kind was being inflicted or might be inflicted."" 
        
       
      
    295 These directions were then specifically related to the Appellant Duncan, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of the accused Mr Duncan, just going to the evidence in respect of him and this all depends upon your findings as to fact of course, if you were to find that he took part in a group attack on Christopher Wilson on the basis that he was part of a group which together maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Christopher Wilson with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to him and that they all helped each other with the same intent as demonstrated by their actions towards Christopher Wilson, then you would be entitled to find the accused Mr Duncan guilty of that first offence. 
         
         
        You would also be entitled to find him guilty if you were to find that any part of his behaviour from the time of making a phone call to Jason Kusonogovski through taking the mobile phone from Matthew Michael to, if you found it to be the case, luring the Sydney boys down to the car park to trying to run them down with the car, if that is what you find it to be, was with the intention that others of the group would fight the - for want of a better term what I will call the Sydney boys - and cause one or more of them grievous bodily harm with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm or with the intention that others of the group would fight the Sydney boys and in so doing might cause one or more of them grievous bodily harm with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm as I say, that will also be one way of finding guilt."" 
        
       
      
    296 At the next break, in response to his Honour's invitation to counsel to raise any matters of concern, counsel for Duncan then sought a redirection based upon the proposition that the evidence might support a conviction upon the statutory alternative to the principal count, but not upon the principal count itself.297 This involved a submission that there was a possible view of the evidence open which meant that, while Duncan may have initiated the altercation, he was unaware of the presence of any weapons in the possession of his associates, or of the possibility of their use, or of the ferocity of the attack upon which they embarked, such that the only count available would be in the alternative.298 The Crown referred his Honour to the decisions in R v Esho and Sako [2001] NSWCCA 415 and Regina v Gilbert Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267, in relation to joint enterprise and the alternative count.299 After the break his Honour revisited the directions previously given in relation to specific intention, malice, and the statutory alternative. In relation to the element involving specific intention, His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""You will recall that I said that one element of ‘malice’, or ‘maliciously’, was doing something intentionally, and I also said that intent or intention, intentionally had the same meaning as the word ‘intent’ and its associates as ‘intent’ is used later on in the charge where it reads ‘with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson’. Let me make it clear that the intent to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson, where it is used as the final words of that charge, referred to the specific intention to do grievous bodily harm to Christopher Wilson. As I have said to you, it dose (sic) not necessarily mean to the extent of the injuries actually inflicted but it does mean specifically to do grievous bodily harm to him."" 
         
         
         
        
       
      
    300 After reminding the jury that the Crown also had to prove that the accused acted maliciously, his Honour first read to them the statutory definition of that expression and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Maliciously 
        , as used in count 1, does not precisely equate with the words ‘with intent to case grievous bodily harm’. In order to prove malice, it is sufficient for the Crown to prove indifference to human life or suffering, or intent to injure in some way, which might in fact fall short of grievous bodily harm, or recklessness, or wantonness. And the difference between count 1 in the indictment and the statutory alternative, of course does not lie in the use of the word ‘maliciously’ but lies in the presence of the words in count 1 ‘with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson’ and the absence of that element from the statutory alternative. So that in order to convict in respect of count 1 in the indictment, you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the Crown case that the accused intended to do grievous bodily harm to the said Christopher Wilson. If you are not so satisfied of that but you were satisfied of the other elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt, then you would be entitled to find the accused guilty on the statutory alternative."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    301 No further complaint was made by counsel in relation to these directions. It was however submitted on appeal that the directions were misleading and deficient, in that there was a failure to apply the evidence that was available to support the elements of the primary count and of the statutory alternative, in a way which differentiated between them.302 In essence, it was contended that: 
     
      
       
      (i) The summing up was confusing, and blurred the concepts of malice, specific intent, and the elements of the statutory alternative; 
       
       
      (ii) it did not provide sufficient direction upon the elements of the offences and the burden and standard of proof that was applicable to each; and that 
       
       
      (iii) there should have been directions, although none were sought at trial, to the effect that mere presence as a bystander is insufficient to incur criminal liability:  
      Regina v Doorey & Gage 
       [1970] 3 NSWR 351 and  
      Regina v Clarkson 
       (1971) 1 WLR 1402, and that a person who is present at the commission of a crime is not liable as an accessory, unless he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit a crime:  
      Regina v Stokes and Difford  
      (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.  
       
      
    303 I am not persuaded that there is any substance in these submissions, or that his Honour failed to give the jury a sufficient explanation of the ways in which the Appellant could be held criminally responsible, upon the first count or the statutory alternative respectively, for the attack upon Christopher Wilson, in accordance with the principles identified in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 and McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108. These directions did not, on a fair reading, obscure the difference between the principal charge and the alternative.304 It is not clear what was intended by the submission that the directions were unclear as to the ingredients of the primary offence, or as to the burden and standard of proof applicable thereto. The elements of the first count, and of the alternative, were specifically and correctly identified. His Honour made it clear, from the outset, that the onus of proof of those elements rested upon the Crown, and that it was one requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. At no time was anything said to derogate from that, or to blur the distinction between the elements required for the primary count and the alternative, respectively.305 The submission that the concepts of malice and specific intent were blurred in the directions which were initially given, concerning the first count, is similarly without merit. The passages which I have extracted show that, when the summing up is considered as a whole, adequate and clear directions were given which separated the two elements. The jury could not have been left in any uncertainty in this respect, as was also made abundantly clear in the final two paragraphs of the last extracted section of the summing up.306 I turn next to the submission that his Honour should have given a direction to the jury, in the terms that was sought by trial counsel, as to the circumstances in which the jury should convict on the statutory alternative rather than the primary count. The direction sought was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The Crown has relied on the presence and use of weapons such as machetes, iron bars, stakes, wheel braces and a wheel lock, as evidence of intention that really serious bodily harm would or could be inflicted. In respect of Paul Duncan if you are satisfied on the remaining elements required to make out count 1 of the indictment, but you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Paul Duncan knew of the presence or use of such weapons, you would convict on the statutory alternative, that is maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm in circumstances without intent to inflict grievous bodily harm."" 
         
        
       
      
    307 In essence Duncan asserts that this involved a hypothesis, consistent with innocence, which should have been the subject of a specific direction. There are obvious problems with that submission. First a hypothesis consistent with innocence must be both reasonable and available on the evidence: R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203 (at para 56) and R v Skaf and Others [2004] NSWCCA 74 (at para 190-191). In the present case the Appellant had made an inquiry of Gjoreski for a weapon before the incident began. He had also asked Ljubicic whether she had anything. He acknowledged to police that he saw some persons with a bat, and there was evidence previously mentioned as to his personal involvement in the fight, in the course of which it must have been patently obvious that weapons were being used.308 In any event, the jury were not left uninformed in relation to the fact that this was an argument which had been advanced by the defence, in so far as his Honour said that counsel had:  
     
      
       
        
        “submitted to you that, before that, you would find there was a verbal slanging match and that at the time that Paul Duncan got into the car no weapons had been produced by the group called the party goers and that you would be satisfied that there’s no evidence that Paul Duncan knew that such weapons were to be used or that there would be an overall stoush, as she put it, between the two groups."" 
        
       
      
    309 Finally, in relation to this ground, is the submission that the directions were deficient in so far as there was no instruction that mere presence of a bystander was insufficient, and that a person who is present at the scene is not liable as an accessory unless he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit the offence.310 I am not persuaded that this ground is made good. The prosecution case was always one depending upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant’s active participation in a joint enterprise. Comprehensive directions were given in relation to joint enterprise and participation, and the suggested directions would not only have been superfluous but they risked complicating what was already a sufficiently complicated matter.311 This ground is not made good. 
     
      
      GROUND 6 – His Honour Failed to Direct the Jury with Respect to the Evidence of Siljanoski 
       
      
    312 This is essentially a repetition of Ground 3, which has already been addressed. It is not made good.  
     
      
       
      ADDITIONAL GROUND 7 –  
       
      His Honour erred in his directions to invite the jury to convict upon a basis apart from a proper evaluation of the evidence and its application to the ingredients of the offence (by leave) 
       
      
    313 The Crown Prosecutor offered ten reasons why, in her submission, the jury should find Duncan guilty. In summary they were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Sione Amone’s evidence of seeing Duncan chase the Sydney group up the hill;  
       
       
      (ii) Carla Busuttil’s evidence of seeing Duncan, Big Chi and Jap hitting and kicking the man on the ground; 
       
       
      (iii) Oliver Gjoreski’s evidence, before the attack, of Duncan asking if he had a baseball bat and then making a search of the boot of his car; 
       
       
      (iv) Steven Siljanoski’s initial statement to police in which he described seeing Duncan and Perre in the group of men who were striking the victim; 
       
       
      (v) Alana Ljubicic’s initial statement to police of Duncan getting out of her car, at a time when people were yelling out “get something” and of them seeing him and Jap in the fights.  
       
       
      (vi) The fact that Duncan told lies in the ERISP to the effect that he had not been at the party, that he had not telephoned Jason Kusonogovski, that he left the park with Alana Ljubojevic, that he was near the car in which Christina Kusonogovski was seated when the fights started, and that the first thing he saw was Asians running down the hill towards him, that persons called “Vim” and “Huy” (whom no one else mentioned) were at the scene, that he was chased by two persons, one of whom had a bat, that he had not realised that Christina Kusonogovski was in the park until Jason Kusonogovski arrived and that he had not got into the red Laser or gone on to Lake Heights; 
       
       
      (vii) The fact of his erratic driving which was only consistent with provocative conduct on his part, and inconsistent with an attempt to get away; 
       
       
      (viii) The fact that blood having the same DNA profile as the victim was found on his shorts; 
       
       
      (ix) the fact that Mathew Michael’s SIM card was found in the pocket of those shorts; 
       
       
      (x) The evidence pointing to him being the last person to get into the red Laser that was driven away, initially by Jose Elbert and then by Big Chi.  
       
      
    314 This ground focuses on the following observations by his Honour, which preceded his summary of the ten points relied upon by the Crown:  
     
      
       
        
        “Let me say, that if you were satisfied that the case had been made out beyond reasonable doubt by  
        any one of those 10 reasons 
        , then that would be sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused. The Crown does not argue, and does not have to argue, that it requires all of that evidence to be accepted by you in order for you to find the accused guilty, but taking into account the evidence that you do find established, you must, before coming to a conclusion of guilt be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that guilt."" 
        
       
      
    315 The opening sentence was somewhat unfortunate, although properly understood I am satisfied that it did not bear out the connotation which is sought to be placed upon it, namely, that the Appellant's guilt could be established if any one of the 10 reasons was made good. That is not what was said. Read fairly, what his Honour was saying was that if any of the ten reasons left the jury satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant's guilt, then it did not matter if some or even all of the others were not made good. It is obvious from the nature of the matters listed that no single one of them taken alone, save for item (ii), could prove the Appellant’s guilt. Nor did the Crown Prosecutor suggest that to be the case.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    316 That this was the sense of what was conveyed to the jury emerges with crystal clarity from the additional observations which his Honour made.  
     
      
    317 At the next adjournment, Counsel pointed to the possibly misleading nature of the opening observations.  
     
      
    318 His Honour then put the matter beyond doubt by directing the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: members of the jury, let me just return to what I was saying before lunch about the Crown's arguments in respect of the guilt of Mr Duncan. Just to make it clear. The Crown does not have to prove each and every one of those items of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown does not, in fact, have to prove any one of those items of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. You consider all of the evidence and you decide on the basis of all of the evidence whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the ingredients or elements of the offence of count 1 in the indictment, are made out and only then would you convict Mr Duncan. If you are not so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the elements of that offence, then you would find him not guilty of course. And the same applies to each of the other offences. For instance, you may well think that if the only evidence in the case was that of Ms Busuttil, that you could have difficulty convicting on the basis of that. Similarly, if you had only the evidence of Mr Siljanoski, you may well think you would have great difficulty convicting on the basis of that, and so on with some of the other aspects of the evidence. It depends on what you think of it, and I am not trying to tell you what to think of any one particular witnesses evidence, that you make of it. It may be that on the basis of some other aspect of the evidence that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that alone. But what the Crown says to you is when you take account of all of that evidence, you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt because those various aspects of the evidence buttress and support each other for you to come to the conclusion, in the end that the accused is guilty."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    319 Subsequently, his Honour made it clear that in relation to Counts 3 and 4, the only evidence of Duncan smashing the motor vehicle was that of Carla Busuttil, and directed the jury that in order to convict him on those counts, they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was ""telling the truth and accurately recounting what had occurred...so far as those particular aspects are concerned"". This was accompanied by a direction to scrutinise her evidence carefully. This ground is also not made good. 320 For these reasons I am of the view that Duncan's appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
      DUNCAN SENTENCE APPEAL 
       
       
      GROUND (a) - His Honour Made Erroneous Findings as to the Objective Circumstances of the Offence. 
       
      
    321 It was submitted that his Honour overstated the role, and the objective criminality, of the Appellant, in so far as he found that he had been “the architect of the night’s events”, and had “deliberately set about inciting an attack upon” the Sydney group. It was also submitted that he erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that Duncan had been part of the group beating Christopher Wilson and in so far as he added:  
     
      
       
        
        “You were very prominent this night. You were in the centre of attention for a number of reasons. You had summoned your troops. You drove the car dangerously. You got out of the car. There is not a single witness who says they saw you just standing by, watching what was going on, or, for that matter, doing anything else unconnected with the assault on Christopher Wilson. Not one of them says anything like “Babe was with me while Christopher Wilson was being assaulted. 
        
       
       
        
        However I should also say that it seems to me to add or subtract little from your criminal culpability whether you were the person involved in beating Christopher Wilson. The alternative is that you stood by and watched all [the] people you had called up, and provoked, did so, and you did nothing to stop them… 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances, having stirred up and unleashed your followers, if you did stand back, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is virtually letting them to (sic) your dirty work. In my view, there would not be a matter sounding in mitigation of this offence.” 
        
       
      
    322 These findings, it was submitted, were not properly open on the evidence, and that rather than the incident having involved a planned attack, it was one that unexpectedly developed and escalated, in the volatile circumstances of the night.  
     
      
    323 Further it was contended that although his Honour found that Carla Busuttil’s evidence was buttressed by that of Steven Siljanoski, there was still a deficiency of evidence to establish that this Appellant was one of the persons who had personally assaulted the victim, or alternatively that he knowingly stood by and encouraged those who were directly involved in the attack to beat and assault the victim. 
     
      
    324 This Court is a Court of error, it does not conduct a review of factual findings unless there was no evidence to support those findings: R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351, R v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64; House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499; R v Crowley [2004] NSWCCA 256; R v Randell and McAlister [2004] NSWCCA 337. 
     
      
    325 In the present case there was evidence to support the findings that by his actions Duncan initiated the events that led to the attack upon the victim, and that he personally participated in the attack. There was no evidence of premeditation, and to that extent it may be accepted, in the Appellant’s favour, that the incident escalated somewhat quickly, and did not begin with any specific intention on the Appellant’s part to occasion grievous bodily harm, specifically to Christopher Wilson as distinct from someone in the Sydney group. The Appellant’s submission that there was no evidence to show that he was present when the victim was attacked, cannot be sustained, and at best comes very close to traversing the jury’s verdict.  
     
      
    326 In the particular circumstances of this case, while it was properly open for his Honour to find that the Appellant was an active participant in the violence inflicted upon the victim, I am also unpersuaded that the alternative scenario, which would still have involved the Appellant’s participation in a joint venture which he had initiated, would have involved any significant lessening in his objective criminality.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS (b) AND (c): 
       
       
      b) His Honour Rejected or Failed to Adequately Take Into Account the Subjective Findings Favourable to the Applicant that were Available and Uncontested on the Evidence. 
       
       
      c) His Honour Failed to Adequately Consider the Age of the Offender and the Evidence of Rehabilitation. 
       
      
    327 The Appellant was born on 26 November 1983 and was aged 17 years and 11 months at the time of the offence. He had a juvenile record which included entries for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of affray, which had attracted Community Service Orders only four months earlier, two offences of driving while disqualified, one offence of reckless driving and one offence of drive conveyance taken without consent. He was subject to a 2 year Order for Probation in relation the second drive while disqualified offence, at the time of the current offences.  
     
      
    328 He had been kept in detention for 9 months following his arrest, before being bailed. He had established a record of exemplary behaviour during that period.  
     
      
    329 There was also evidence in his favour that he had been of good behaviour, had been employed and was living in a steady domestic situation while he was on bail.  
     
      
    330 There were reports before his Honour from Juvenile Justice Officer Kilby, Dr Westmore and Associate Professor Susan Hayes. There was also a substantial number of character references.  
     
      
    331 His Honour was somewhat critical of Officer Kilby’s report in so far as the Appellant’s regret for his actions, and realisation of the wrongness thereof, which that officer recorded, were said to be inconsistent with his denial of any responsibility for the offence. His Honour also rejected this Officer’s suggestion that the situation got out of control due to peer pressure, immaturity, and alcohol, upon the basis that the Appellant had been in complete control of matters, and showed no difficulty in carrying out the physical and mental steps involved.  
     
      
    332 His Honour was also critical of Dr Westmore’s report, in so far as the history which the Appellant was recorded as giving was considered to have been “almost entirely at variance with the evidence given at the trial and with the jury’s verdict.” This account, his Honour found, demonstrated the emptiness and insincerity of the expressions of remorse which he had purportedly disclosed to Officer Kilby, indicating a lack of insight, and being suggestive of a habit of minimising his criminal culpability in defiance of the proved or admitted facts.  
     
      
    333 His Honour was similarly critical of the report of Professor Hayes in so far as the history which she was apparently given by the Appellant was said to be “far removed from the truth”, and also in so far as she had also offered an opinion that alcohol consumption, or the influence of the peer group, had been major factors in the commission of the offence, and had described the Appellant as remorseful.  
     
      
    334 While his Honour was dismissive of the reports from Dr Westmore and Professor Hayes in relation to their assessment of the triggers for the offences, it remains the fact that they did identify some favourable subjective circumstances, in so far as Dr Westmore saw it as a positive that he had been able to maintain a lengthy relationship with his girlfriend and had reduced his use of recreational drugs and alcohol during the period on bail. He excluded any sign of major psychotic illness, but drew attention to the Appellant’s earlier history of polysubstance abuse.  
     
      
    335 Professor Hayes noted that because of his below average intelligence, he might have been expected to have had limited insight into the causes of his own offending behaviour, in the past, and on this occasion. She also suggested that he may stay out of trouble if he could continue to receive the kind of sympathetic supervision which he had received from the Machan family. Additionally she drew attention to his somewhat dysfunctional background, which had involved abuse of alcohol and violence on the part of his father, and which had eventually led to the break up of the family. It was during this period, when he lacked family support, that his earlier offending had occurred. Psychotic disorders were excluded.  
     
      
    336 In the result his Honour dealt with this aspect of the sentencing exercise in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “You were the ringleader in the perpetration of the terrible events of this night. I find no evidence of any genuine contrition or remorse, nor any acceptance of the jury’s verdict, or its ramifications. Youth is really the only matter in your favour, but considerations of giving greater weight to rehabilitation on that account cannot outweigh the factors to be attributed to the objective circumstances of the offences where there is little to support the youth factor. In your case, there is no contrition or remorse, and no real insight into the nature of what you have done and why.”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    337 In general terms it was submitted that his Honour should have given greater weight to the expert opinions which had not been challenged by the Crown, and should have made a more positive finding as to the Appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation and also as to his remorse. Similar submissions to those that were advanced in relation to Perre were made, concerning the greater importance of rehabilitation in the sentencing of a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    338 In these respects it was argued that insufficient weight had been given to the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it applied at the relevant time. 
     
      
    339 I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in relation to his findings as to lack of remorse and contrition, or as to a lack of insight. While the Appellant is not to be additionally punished for defending the proceedings, his continued claim of innocence, and his distortion of the facts when providing histories to the expert witnesses, amply justified his Honour’s findings.  
     
      
    340 I am, however, of the view that his Honour somewhat understated the significance of rehabilitation for a young offender who had a relatively minor record, albeit that he was on Probation, and had only recently received a sentence involving community service, and who had shown some signs of behaving in an acceptable fashion between the time of the offence and the time of sentencing. The principles identified in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 were applicable as was the Appellant’s immaturity (R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; see also s 3A(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). This was subject to a suitable balance being struck in the light of the consideration that the case was one involving extreme violence, and was also one where the offender was approaching adulthood: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 and R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 per Lee CJ at CL.  
     
      
    341 As these reasons later indicate I have reached the conclusion that the sentence was so far outside an appropriate range of sentencing discretion that at least latent error was disclosed. It may be that, in part, this was due to his Honour giving insufficient weight to these considerations.  
     
      
       
      Ground (d) 
       
      it is submitted that his Honour should have found special circumstances within section 44 of the C 
      rimes Sentencing Procedure Act. 
       
      
    342 His Honour said, in this respect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although it is open to me to find special circumstances on account of youth, and perhaps other matters, in my view, the period of supervision available on parole will be sufficient in view of the structure of the sentences I propose.  
        
       
       
        
        I take into account the eight months eighteen days spent in custody.  
        
       
       
        
        A submission was made on your behalf that I should order that so much of your sentence as possible be served in a juvenile institution. You will be twenty this coming November. Most of your sentence will have to be served in an adult institution. In my view, the concerns about spending your time in an adult institution are not more than apply to most prisoners unfortunately. I see little point in making such an order.”  
        
       
      
    343 It was submitted that there were a number of factors that potentially qualified as special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including the Appellant’s age, his stable relationship and support within the Machan family, his prospects for rehabilitation, and the fact that this was to be his first prison sentence, being one that was to be served in an adult gaol. 
     
      
    344 It was also submitted that his Honour erred in apparently viewing the special circumstances to be relevant only in relation to the period during which the offender would be subject to supervision; whereas in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, it had been made clear that the primary consideration should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration, and that this encompasses the full range of issues which are relevant to this period. 
     
      
    345 As in the case of Perre, the non-parole period was set at the statutory ratio, and similar considerations arise in relation to this ground, which overlaps with the final ground of challenge to the sentence, concerning whether or not sufficient weight was given to the subjective circumstances of the offender, when the sentence as a whole was constructed. 
     
      
    346 It is to be recalled that it was made clear, by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 (paras 63 and 65), that the ultimate constraint on the discretion of a sentencing judge to find special circumstances warranting a reduction of the non-parole period, is that the non-parole period must itself reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence. His Honour continued (para 67): 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
        “Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    347 In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 the Chief Justice observed at para 18: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non-parole period, must be avoided. (See  
        Simpson  
        at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.” 
        
       
      
    348 It is self evident that the various matters identified by the Appellant were potentially capable of qualifying as special circumstances. The real question is whether they were given sufficient weight in accordance with the decision in Regina v Simpson, which inevitably also drew attention to the potential period of release upon supervision. 
     
      
    349 Two considerations weigh in relation to parole. First, release on parole does provide a constraint on poor behaviour and re-offending in view of the possibility of its revocation and return of the offender to custody to serve the balance of parole. Secondly, there are practical constraints in relation to the period of time for which supervision can be given, as well as questions as to its continued utility where rehabilitation has been achieved. As a result there may, sometimes, be no real purpose in structuring a sentence in a way that will potentially provide an unduly lengthy period of release on parole. In other cases a prolonged period of release on parole may be appropriate.  
     
      
    350 Essentially the same considerations apply in relation the absence of a finding of special circumstances in Duncan’s case, as applied in relation to Perre. The question is inextricably linked with the final ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground (e) - Parity 
       
        
      
    351 The parity argument was largely confined to the comparison that was made with the sentence that had been imposed on Lamacchia.  
     
      
    352 The principle of parity was settled in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134 at 301. For the Court to intervene, it must be satisfied that the difference in sentences between co-offenders, after making sufficient allowance for any differences in their objective and subjective circumstances, would leave the Appellant with a justifiable sense of grievance. As was said in Postiglione at 303: 
     
      
       
        
        “As between co-offenders, different criminal histories and custodial patterns may be such as to justify a real difference in the time each will serve in prison. And, of course, it is necessary when applying the parity principle that like be compared with like. There may be some aspect of one offender’s criminal history or custodial situation which has no counterpart in the case of his or her co-accused. If so, it may justify the imposition of a different sentence or the structuring of the sentence in such a way that it results in some difference in the period actually spent in custody.” 
        
       
      
    353 In the present case there were a number of differences of significance between Duncan and Lamacchia, in that Lamacchia had: 
     
      
       
      (i) pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to an offence contrary to s 35  
      Crimes Act 
       carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years, compared with the s 33 offence which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years to which the Appellant had pleaded not guilty; 
       
       
      (ii) he had confessed to his part in the attack when first interviewed by police; 
       
       
      (iii) he was genuinely contrite and remorseful; 
       
       
      (iv) he was not armed; 
       
       
      (v) he kicked Christopher Wilson twice towards the end of the assault, there being no evidence that his acts caused any particular damage; 
       
       
      (vi) he did this on the spur of the moment without premeditation; 
       
       
      (vii) whilst he had a criminal record it did not include any offences of viole",2004-12-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

Introduction
1       The Plaintiff, Tan Bee Hock, is a regular serviceman with the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”). On 12 March 2012, he went for a medical test. Following the test, he fatefully detoured to visit a show unit in a condominium development known as Parc Rosewood (“the Development”) instead of returning directly to his camp. His mode of transportation was his motorcycle. En-route, he skidded on one of two metal plates placed by the Defendant, F G Builders Pte Ltd, on the road at the entrance to the Development and fell, sustaining injuries to his left leg and damaging his motorcycle as a result. The Plaintiff sued for the injuries suffered and damage caused, alleging various acts and omissions on the part of the Defendant in connection with the metal plates amounting to negligence. This is the pith of this action.
Background facts
2       As noted above, the Plaintiff is a regular serviceman with the SAF. His vocation at the time of the accident was “Combat Fit Commando”. He was based at the Hendon Camp in Changi.
3       The Defendant is the main contractor for the Development. The Development is located on Rosewood Drive off Woodlands Avenue 1. Rosewood Drive is a “two-lane” and “two-way” road, and a cul-de-sac. At the time of the accident, the Development was under construction.
4       The Plaintiff purchased a unit in the Development off the plans in February 2012 apparently on the advice of his brother.
[note: 1]
 Accordingly, he did not visit a show unit prior to the purchase. This perhaps was the motivation for his fateful and ultimately unfortunate detour on 12 March 2012.
5       The Plaintiff was on duty on 12 March 2012. That morning, he reported to Sembawang Camp, which is located at Admiralty Road West, for a medical test described as a “Dive Medical Check”. The test was over sometime between 11.45am to 11.50am. He was required to report to his superiors at Hendon Camp at 1.30pm that afternoon for a training exercise which he described as “Close Quarters Battle Training”. Assessing that he had sufficient time, he detoured to the Development to view the show unit.
6       Around noon, while travelling on Rosewood Drive towards the Development, he noticed two large metal plates (“the Plates”) on the road at the entrance to the Development. The weather and visibility were good. There was no traffic either behind or before the Plaintiff in the lane in which he was travelling.
7       The Plates were both rectangular in shape, of even size, and of substantial weight and strength. They were placed beside each other and took up the full width of the lane on which the Plaintiff was riding. The Defendant’s sole witness, its Project Director, Tan Yit Poh (“Mr Tan”), testified that the Plates were meant to facilitate ingress and egress of heavy vehicles to and from constructions sites and for travel within the sites by such vehicles. The weight and strength of the Plates were therefore a function of their purpose. According to Mr Tan, each plate weighed approximately two tonnes.
8       The Plates were placed with their length running in the direction of the road and their breadth running vertical to the pavement. I shall describe the individual plates as the “Left Plate” and the “Right Plate”, the former being the plate closer to, and the latter being the plate further from, the pavement. For ease of understanding, the Left Plate and the Right Plate are identified in a photograph of the Plates, reproduced below, taken by the Plaintiff shortly after the accident (“the Photograph”):
 
 
9       The front wheel of the Plaintiff’s motorcycle hit the edge of the breadth of the Left Plate (“the Left Edge”) slightly off centre to the right. This resulted in the Plaintiff losing control of the motorcycle and skidding on the Left Plate, eventually falling on his right side in between the Plates. There was some controversy as to whether the Plates were wet at the time of the accident. There was also controversy as to whether the Plates were flush with each other or placed at a “V” to each other as seen in the Photograph (“the V Placement”). However, for reasons that will be apparent later, the V Placement did not cause the accident. It was common ground that there were no eye-witnesses to the accident.
10     The Plaintiff was assisted by three workers in the Development to a security post at the entrance to the Development after the accident. After recovering somewhat, the Plaintiff had the presence of mind to take two photographs – one of the Plates (
ie
, the Photograph) and the other of the signboard that contained details of the Development and its various stakeholders. This act is important in the assessment of the evidence as to the cause of the accident.
11     Thereafter, the Plaintiff travelled to Hendon Camp on his motorcycle. He sought medical treatment from Changi General Hospital that evening because of pain and swelling in his left knee. On 19 March 2012, the Plaintiff emailed the National Environmental Agency (“NEA”) to notify them of the accident and to lodge a complaint that the Plates had been placed on the road.
[note: 2]
 A police report of the accident was lodged on 15 August 2012
[note: 3]
 (“the Police Report”) and an injury report was made to the SAF on 6 September 2012.
[note: 4]
 The Plaintiff was eventually diagnosed with a longitudinal tear in the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, and underwent surgery at the National University Hospital on 16 October 2012.
12     Meanwhile, on 13 March 2012, the Defendant applied to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) for approval to carry out milling and patching work on that portion of road that the Plates covered. This appeared to be a reaction to the accident. Pending approval, on 15 March 2012, the Defendant removed the Plates.
[note: 5]
 Approval for the said works was granted by the LTA on 21 March 2012, and the works were carried out thereafter.
The Plaintiff’s Case
13     The Plaintiff’s causes of action are in the tort of negligence and breach of statutory duty under the Code of Practice for Traffic Control at Work Zone (2006 Edition) (“the Code”) issued by the LTA under Regulation 12 of the Street Works (Works on Public Streets) Regulations 1995 (Cap 320A, Rg 2, 1995 Rev Ed) (“the Regulations”). The particulars pleaded in support of both causes of action are common. In the main, the particulars can be classed in two categories:
(a)     the condition and/or manner of placement of the Plates; and
(b)     the failure to implement adequate safeguards for motorists, as a result of placing the Plates on the road, purportedly required either by the Code or as a matter of a duty of care owed by the Defendant to motorists.
14     As regards the first category, the principal complaints were that:
(a)     the Plates were warped or placed unevenly on the road;
(b)     the Defendant failed to implement a regime to inspect the condition of the Plates; and
(c)     the Defendant failed to ensure that the Plates were fully aligned or flush with each other.
15     As regards the second category, the complaints were that:
(a)     the Defendant failed to provide traffic signs to warn motorists of the Plates;
(b)     the Defendant failed to take sufficient steps to ensure that motorists would avoid risks associated with the Plates being placed on the road; and
(c)     the Defendant breached the Code by failing to indicate to motorists with appropriate signage a bypass route that would avoid the Plates.
16     The Plaintiff also pleaded that the Plates constituted a nuisance, and that the accident was caused by such nuisance.
The Defence
17     The principal defences were that:
(a)     the Left Plate was not warped;
(b)     the Plates were connected to or flush with each other;
(c)     it was necessary to place the Plates on the road because the road had undergone milling and patching works on 24 February 2012 as a result of damage caused by heavy vehicles entering and leaving the construction site;
(d)     the Plaintiff’s negligence caused or contributed to the accident in that the Plaintiff: (i) drove at an excessive speed; (ii) failed to slow down near the construction site; (iii) failed to pay attention to road conditions; (iv) failed to slow down to bypass the Plates; and, (v) failed to exercise proper control over his motorcycle; and
(e)     the Code did not apply to the placement of the Plates; alternatively, the Defendant was not in breach of any statutory duty under the Code.
Preliminary observations
18     The action was bifurcated. Though the Defendant issued Third Party Proceedings against United Overseas Insurance Ltd, that was not pursued. Therefore, only the issue of liability in the parent proceedings was before me.
19     The elements of the tort of negligence have been comprehensively articulated in 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 (“
Spandeck
”). In order for the Plaintiff to succeed in the tort of negligence, the Plaintiff must show that (a) the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty of care; (b) the Defendant breached this duty of care; and, (c) the Defendant’s breach caused the Plaintiff damage. While the tort of breach of statutory duty is a separate and independent tort from that of negligence, claimants often bring concurrent claims in negligence and breach of statutory duty. The Plaintiff may sue the Defendant for breach of statutory duty only in circumstances where he has a private right of civil action against the Defendant for the breach of a 
statutory duty
 in the first place. Thus, there must be a statutory duty which the Plaintiff has breached as a consequence of which, a right of private action arises because the Plaintiff is one of a class of persons upon whom Parliament intended to confer such a right (see Gary Chan, 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“
Gary Chan
”) at para 9.007). This requires an examination of whether there is such a statutory duty on the present facts to begin with. Additionally, the Plaintiff must also establish that (a) the breach caused the Plaintiff to suffer damage; and (b) that damage is within the scope of protection of the statute (see 
Gary Chan
 at para 9.009).
20     I make three observations on the pleadings and evidence. First, though the complaint in the Statement of Claim was that the Plates were warped, it became apparent early in the trial and from the Plaintiff’s submissions that the focus was in fact on the Left Plate, and in particular the Left Edge. From the Plaintiff’s oral testimony, it was clear that his position was that the front wheel of his motorcycle came into contact with the Left Edge. The Left Edge was allegedly tilted upwards from the ground, albeit slightly (“the Tilt”). It was alleged that the contact of the front wheel of the Plaintiff’s motorcycle with the Tilt caused the Plaintiff to lose control of the motorcycle.
21     Second, it was accepted by the Plaintiff that the V Placement did not cause the accident.
[note: 6]
 The Plaintiff testified that he had seen the V Placement and made an effort to – and did – avoid it.
[note: 7]
 The alleged cause of the accident was, as mentioned earlier, the Tilt.
22     Third, the Plaintiff did not plead and therefore does not rely on the placement of the Plates on the road 
per se
 as an act of negligence or breach of statutory duty. Counsel for the Plaintiff conceded this in the course of the trial and during the oral hearing of the closing submissions.
[note: 8]
 The Plaintiff’s written closing submissions are also consistent with this position. At trial, the Plaintiff had also testified that he had ridden over many metal plates but had never met with any accidents.
[note: 9]
 That being the case, the Plaintiff’s causes of action were framed on the basis that the Defendant’s duty to take reasonable care 
vis-à-vis
 the Plaintiff required the Defendant to ensure that: (a) the Plates were in a safe condition and flush with the road; (b) motorists were sufficiently warned of their placement; and, (c) a bypass route was organised around the Plates for motorists, and the Defendant was culpable in negligence for failing to discharge the requisite standard of care in each instance. Indeed, it is clear from the Plaintiff’s closing submissions that the crux of the Plaintiff’s case in negligence is the presence of the Tilt. Accordingly, to succeed in negligence, the Plaintiff would have to establish the presence of the Tilt as a fact. If there was no Tilt, the Plaintiff would need to show in the alternative that the failure to warn motorists of the Plates or organise a bypass route were breaches of duty on the Defendant’s part that caused or contributed to the accident. In this connection, it was common ground that the Defendant had not organised a bypass route or warned motorists through appropriate signage that the Plates had been placed on the road.
The issues before the court
23     Based on the foregoing, the issues before me are as follows:
(a)     whether the Plaintiff has a right of action against the Defendant in the tort of breach of statutory duty;
(b)     whether the Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff at common law or in statute;
(c)     the standard of care expected of the Defendant and whether the Defendant breached its duty of care to the Plaintiff by the various acts and omissions alleged;
(d)     whether the Defendant’s breach of duty caused the Plaintiff’s loss and damage; and
(e)     whether the Plates constituted a nuisance.
24     I approach the issues by dealing first with the Plaintiff’s action in negligence and nuisance before coming to the Plaintiff’s cause of action in the tort of breach of statutory duty.
Negligence
The duty of care
25     The test to be applied in Singapore to ascertain whether a duty of care arises has been comprehensively set out by the Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
. It comprises a threshold question of factual foreseeability, followed by a two-stage test of (a) proximity and (b) policy considerations. Applying the 
Spandeck
 test to the facts, I am prepared to accept that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the Plates were properly placed and in a safe condition so that motorists would not suffer harm by reason of their placement. It is certainly reasonably foreseeable that if the Defendant was negligent in this regard, motorists such as the Plaintiff could suffer harm when traversing the Plates. Also, the relationship between the Defendant and the Plaintiff is sufficiently proximate in terms of physical proximity, circumstantial proximity and causal proximity. Finally, there are no policy considerations which militate against the imposition of a duty of care in these circumstances.
Standard of care and breach of duty
26     The crucial question in the present case is whether the Defendant has discharged its duty to take reasonable care 
vis-à-vis
 the Plaintiff. It is well-established that a defendant will be regarded as having breached the duty if his standard falls below what the law requires of him. The standard of care a defendant is required to demonstrate is normally that of a reasonable and prudent man. The famous formulation of the standard of care may be found in the words of Baron Alderson in 
Blyth v The Company of Proprietors of the Birmingham Waterworks
 (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784:
Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do; or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.
27     In 
BNJ (suing by her lawful father and litigation representative, B) v SMRT Trains Ltd and another

 at [55], Vinodh Coomaraswamy J stated that the question of whether a defendant has breached the standard of care required cannot be analysed in a vacuum. Rather, the question of breach must be analysed in light of the “nature of the specific risk that has eventuated”. Coomaraswamy J cited with approval the following passage from 
Walker v Northumberland County Council
 [1995] ICR 702 at 711:
It is reasonably clear from the authorities that once a duty of care has been established the standard of care required for the performance of that duty must be measured against the yardstick of reasonable conduct on the part of a person in the position of that person who owes the duty. The law does not impose upon him the duty of an insurer against all injury or damage caused by him, however unlikely or unexpected and whatever the practical difficulties of guarding against it. It calls for no more than a reasonable response, what is reasonable being measured by the nature of the neighbourhood principle, the magnitude of the risk of injury which was reasonably foreseeable, the seriousness of the consequence for the person to whom the duty is owed of the risk eventuating and the cost and impracticability of preventing the risk.
28     The risk in the present case is this: that a motorcyclist traversing the Plates would be jolted to the extent of losing control of his motorcycle and suffering injury as consequence. As stated above, the Plaintiff pleads that in order for the Defendant to discharge his duty of care, the Defendant ought to have (a) ensured that the Plates were in a safe condition and evenly placed; (b) warned road users of the presence and condition of the Plates; and (c) organised a bypass route around the Plates so that motorists could avoid the Plates.
29     The Plaintiff drew inspiration from the Code, in particular Chapter 2. The Plaintiff’s purpose in referring to the Code here is that it reveals what precautions a reasonable and prudent person would have taken in the circumstances. I set out salient portions of Chapter 2 for ease of reference:
 
2-1 General
 
2-1.1 This Chapter elaborates on the fundamental principles in ensuring a good and proper 
traffic control system
 is provided in a work zone. 
It is not possible to provide standards and applications to cover all conditions
. … Complying with fundamental principles shall take precedence over standard details and typical applications.
 
2-2 Safe Road Environment
 
2-2.1 Safe passages should be provided for both motorists and pedestrians going through the work zone. This can be achieved by:
(1)     
Warning
 road users in advance of changing road environment;
(2)     
Informing
 road users of the condition to be encountered;
(3)     
Guiding
 road users through unusual sections of road;
(4)     
Controlling
 road users at conflict point; and
(5)     
Forgiving
 road users’ mistakes when accidents happen.
 
2-3 Minimum Risk
 
2-3.1 Risks for road users going through the work zone can be mitigated by ensuring:
(1)    No surprises;
(2)    No hidden traps;
(3)    Free of unforgiving hazards;
(4)    Controlled release of information;
(5)    Consistent messages and repeats if necessary to reinforce; and
(6)    Good visibility under all road conditions.
[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]
30     It is immediately apparent that Chapter 2 of the Code contains broad general guidelines for the design of a traffic control system in a work zone and may not be squarely relevant in the present case. Nevertheless, it may offer some useful guidance in ascertaining the Defendant’s standard of care for the purposes of its liability in negligence. In my view, the common thread that can be extracted from the portions of the Code quoted above is the need for persons who carry out works near or on roads to ensure a 
safe road environment
 that 
minimises risks
 to motorists. As the Code acknowledges, there are a variety of ways in which one may discharge a duty to ensure the same. These are all dependent on the facts and circumstances. Where the work conducted is extensive and involves a high risk of accidents, such as excavation works, one would expect a higher degree of care to be taken, for example, by employing traffic marshals to direct traffic in the appropriate direction. However, where the “work” consists of the laying of metal sheets on the ground, the scope of the duty imposed on the Defendant to ensure a safe environment that minimises risk to motorists may not extend to enlisting the assistance of traffic marshals.
31     The Defendant’s purpose of placing the Plates on the road was to smoothen out the uneven tarmac surface at the entrance to the Development. Mr Tan deposed in his Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief (“AEIC”) that the Plates were placed at the entrance to the Development as a “temporary measure to protect other road users from the uneven tarmac surfaces and to prevent the road condition of uneven tarmac surface from worsening”.
[note: 10]
 In this regard, a basic facet of the duty of care of any person who places objects on public roads is to ensure that the objects placed on the roads are safe. In this case, the Defendant was required to ensure that the Plates were sufficiently safe to allow motorists to travel across them unscathed. The safety of the Plates would include ensuring that motorists would be able to traverse the Plates without incident whether the Plates were wet or dry, making sure that the Plates were strong enough to take the weight of vehicles and that they were not be warped or tilted such that a vehicle would be jolted when coming into contact with them. If the Defendant is able to discharge this basic duty, I find that there is no further need for the Defendant to have warned motorists of the Plates by enlisting the assistance of traffic marshals or organising a bypass route around the Plates. Indeed, it would be counterintuitive to argue that a bypass route was necessary when the very purpose of the Plates was to ensure safe passage over that stretch of the road that they covered. Similarly, to require traffic marshals to warn motorists of the presence of the Plates would be counterintuitive as the Plates were there precisely to improve motorists’ safety.
32     I note that it is the Plaintiff’s evidence that he has ridden across many metal sheets without incident.
[note: 11]
 It is also significant that the Plaintiff’s position was that the placement of metal sheets on the road 
per se
 was not a dangerous or risky matter in and of itself. This is also echoed in the Plaintiff’s written submissions:
[note: 12]
[The Plaintiff] was an experienced rider and had rode over metal sheets on roads on previous occasions without mishap. It is common knowledge that one would occasionally come across metal sheets on the roads. 
This particular metal sheet was warped and caused an accident.
 The preponderance of the evidence strongly suggests that the metal sheet was warped or uneven.
…
The Plaintiff was riding slowing and safely. He rode over the said metal sheet in the same manner as with all his previous encounters with metal sheets placed on roads. He had no reason to think that 
this particular metal sheet
 was warped or uneven and different from the others that he had encountered.
[emphasis added]
33     Inherent in the Plaintiff’s submissions above is the notion that if the Plates were safe like the other sheets which the Plaintiff had previously encountered, no accident would have or ought to have occurred. The danger which the Defendant had created was in leaving a 
warped
 or 
tilted
 metal plate on the road. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine if the condition of the Plates was indeed unsafe in the manner alleged. In this regard, as noted earlier, the primary question is whether the Tilt existed. It is to this factual question that I now turn.
Did the Tilt exist?
34     As mentioned earlier, the thrust of the Plaintiff’s case, as framed by the pleadings, was that the condition of the Plates and the manner in which they were placed caused the accident. The allegations concerned the Tilt and the V Placement.
35     However, in the Plaintiff’s AEIC, his oral testimony, and his closing arguments, the Plaintiff distilled his position down to one factor – the Tilt – as the real cause of the accident. He testified that his motorcycle was severely jolted when the front wheel came into contact with the Left Edge, somewhere off centre to the right of the Left Plate, because it was tilted upwards.
[note: 13]
 This in turn caused him to lose balance and control of the motorcycle, which was exacerbated by the wet surface of the Left Plate. Consequently, he skidded for four metres and fell, eventually nestling in the gap between the Plates. The Defendant did not challenge the Plaintiff’s assertion that the Plates were wet. Also, from the Photograph taken by the Plaintiff shortly after the accident, it seems reasonably apparent that the Plates were indeed wet at the time of the accident. This being the case, I will have to consider if the Tilt existed. In this regard, the Plaintiff’s testimony and the Photograph were the principal evidence proffered by the Plaintiff of the Tilt.
36     It is important to first understand what the Plaintiff means when he asserts that there was the Tilt. In his AEIC, he said that “[t]he metal sheet edge was protruding way above the road surface”.
[note: 14]
 On the stand, he testified that the Left Edge tilted or warped upwards, though he conceded that the tilt was slight.
[note: 15]
 In his submissions, he stated that there was a “gap between the road surface and the metal sheet [which] was about the size of three fingers thick at the edge of the left metal sheet which [the Plaintiff’s] motorcycle had made contact with”.
[note: 16]
 The Tilt was something he perceived when he examined the Plates following the accident.
[note: 17]
 The Plaintiff’s position therefore appears to be that the Left Edge was not flush with the road and had a slight upward tilt along its entire length. This is the sum of the Plaintiff’s description of the Tilt.
37     I have carefully examined the Photograph. The Tilt is not clearly discernible to me. At best, the right-hand corner of the Left Edge (
ie
, the corner closer to the Right Plate) may be said to be slightly tilted upwards. Counsel for the Plaintiff also stated during the oral hearing of the closing submissions that a tilt was discernible at the right-hand corner of the Left Edge. But that is not where the Plaintiff asserts that the front wheel of his motorcycle caught the Left Edge.
38     It is unfortunate that the Photograph does not shed clear light on what is a critical aspect of the Plaintiff’s claim. It is also strange that it does not. In his AEIC and oral testimony, the Plaintiff testified that he realised that the cause of the accident was the Tilt when he examined the Plates shortly after the accident. The Plaintiff took two photographs thereafter – the Photograph and another of particulars of the Development.
[note: 18]
 It is evident that the Plaintiff took the photographs to capture what he believed was the cause of the accident (
ie
, the Tilt) and the particulars of the potential defendant. Despite this, it is surprising that the Plaintiff did not attempt to effectively and fully capture the Tilt through photographic means. Indeed, it is surprising that the Plaintiff did not take more photographs of the Tilt from a variety of angles.
39     I have considered whether some allowance ought to be given for the fact that the Plaintiff was in shock and therefore would not have the presence of mind to document the Tilt fully. However, accepting that an allowance ought to be made does not gel with the fact that the Plaintiff had the presence of mind in the first place to attempt to document the cause of the accident by taking the Photograph. That the Plaintiff could think about capturing evidence of the accident’s cause would suggest he had regained sufficient composure after the accident. I make three points in this respect. First, the photographs were taken after the Plaintiff had rested by the security post following the accident. He had sufficient time to recover. Second, the photographs were taken after he had examined the Plates carefully to identify what aspect of the Plates had caused or contributed to his mishap. This would again suggest composure and a clear focus of mind. Third, that the Plaintiff was sufficiently settled and comfortable is evidenced by his ability to ride his motorcycle back to Hendon Camp after he had taken the photographs. Collectively, these are indicia of the Plaintiff having regained his composure and focus after the accident. He was in fact able to apply his mind to the issue of what caused the accident and the person or persons who could be responsible for the same. This being the case, if indeed the Tilt was the cause of the accident, or more importantly, if the Plaintiff felt that it was the cause, it is perplexing that he did not do more to document it through photographic evidence. This does raise a fundamental question: did the Tilt exist at all?
40     The Statement of Claim and the Plaintiff’s AEIC alleged that the Tilt existed. The Statement of Claim was filed on 26 June 2014, more than two years after the accident; the AEIC was obviously later in time. It is thus salient to examine documents that were generated closer to the date of the accident to understand what the Plaintiff believed and articulated was the cause of the accident. The Plaintiff’s recollection of the accident would have been fresher and far more vivid then. I note that in his AEIC, the Plaintiff had vividly described the Tilt. If his recollection was that vivid when the AEIC was affirmed, it should have been significantly sharper shortly after the accident. If the Tilt had indeed caused the accident (or if the Plaintiff thought that it had caused the accident), it is only reasonable to assume that the Plaintiff would have asserted so in the documents that he had written soon after the accident. Surprisingly, this was not the case.
41     Four documents stand out in this regard. The first is the complaint that the Plaintiff made to the NEA by email on 19 March 2012, just a week after the accident. In paragraph 5 of his AEIC, the Plaintiff explained that the email was sent to the NEA to complain about the danger posed by the Plates. The danger that the Plaintiff would have had in mind must surely have been the Tilt if the Plaintiff’s testimony is to be accepted. In drafting the email, the Plaintiff must have applied his mind to what he believed was the root cause of the accident, as that would have been the “danger” that he was raising a complaint about. The Photograph must have been referred to when the email was drafted. The facts would have been fresh and fully sorted out in his mind given the purpose and timing of the email. Given the Plaintiff’s allegations at trial, one would expect that the email would unequivocally assert that the Tilt was the cause of the accident. Unfortunately, this was not what the Plaintiff said in the email. The Plaintiff alleged that the V Placement had caught the wheel of his motorcycle, thus causing the accident. It is useful to set out the relevant portions of the email:
On 12/3/12 approximate 1200hrs, I am on my way to the show room [flat] of Parc Rosewood riding into Rosewood Drive. I happened to come [along] this construction site on my left and out of a sudden my bike was 
caught onto the metal plates lying on the floor
. I fell to the ground together with my bike and [skidded] for at [least] 4 meter[s]. …
After seeing the placement of the plates on the road, I came to realise that the plates were not in proper placement. 
It forms a V shape right in the middle of the road causing my bike wheel to be caught and filtered in between the plate.
 …
[emphasis added]
The Plaintiff submitted that this email was not inconsistent with his evidence at trial. However, to accept this submission would be to give an unduly technical and, I should say, generous reading to the words in the email. The inconsistency lies in the fact that no mention was made of the Tilt in this email. The focus of the email was on the V Placement. It seems evident from a plain reading that the reference to the motorcycle catching the metal plates is tied to the reference to the V Placement. It should be noted again that the Plaintiff conceded during the course of his testimony that the V Placement did not cause or contribute to the accident.
42     The second document is the Police Report which the Plaintiff lodged on 15 August 2012 where the Plaintiff stated as follows:
On the 12/03/2012 at about 1200hrs, I was riding my white [motorcycle] along Rosewood Drive. I wish to state that there’s a construction site on my left and there’s metal plates on the said road. After which my motorcycle skidded about 4 meters and I fell to the ground. I wish to state that the weather at that point of time was clear and traffic was clear. … 
I realised that the said metal plates which was placed on the road is not properly placed. … The said plates were placed in a V-shape in the middle of the road.
[emphasis added]
Again, there was no mention of the Tilt; the complaint focussed on the V Placement. It is difficult to understand how the Tilt could have been left out given that the purpose of the Police Report was to pinpoint the cause of the accident.
43     The third document is the letter of demand dated 29 August 2012 from Messrs Kurup & Co, the Plaintiff’s solicitors, to the Defendant (“the Demand Letter”). In the Demand Letter, it was alleged that the placement of the Plates caused the accident. There was no assertion that the Tilt caused the accident. It is reasonable to presume that the Plaintiff’s solicitors would have taken sufficient steps to understand the true cause of the accident before issuing the Demand Letter. The absence of a specific reference to the Tilt is therefore glaring. The Demand Letter was written just two weeks after the Police Report which alleged that the V Placement was the cause of the accident. It would be fair to conclude that the allegation in the Demand Letter was the same, although there was no direct reference to the V Placement.
44     The fourth and final document is an accident report prepared by the Plaintiff’s employers, the SAF. They appointed an investigating officer, one Captain Chen Zhengxin (“Captain Chen”), who prepared a report dated 10 September 2012 (“the SAF report”). In this report, Captain Chen recorded the details of the accident and the Plaintiff’s injury based on the information which he had gathered from the Plaintiff. This was filed for the purpose of recording the Plaintiff’s injuries and setting out how or why they were caused. In the SAF report, there was a reference to the uneven placement of the Plates on the road and the Plates being wet and slippery, which allegedly collectively contributed to the skidding of the motorcycle. While it is conceivable that the allegation that the Plates were placed unevenly could be a reference to the Tilt, given the proximity in time of the SAF report to the Police Report and the Demand Letter, it would be more reasonable to read it as referring to the V Placement. Indeed, if the Plaintiff felt that the accident had been caused by the Tilt, the Plaintiff could have simply said so in unambiguous terms to Captain Chen, rather than use equivocal language. It must not be forgotten in this regard that the SAF report was a declaration being made by the Plaintiff to his employers. The importance of ensuring accuracy must have been apparent to him.
45     Examining these documents collectively and holistically, the Plaintiff’s consistent position in the immediate aftermath of the accident and in the six months thereafter appeared to be that the accident was caused by the V Placement. These were not documents written casually. They were prepared with thought and for the specific purpose of notifying the relevant parties – the NEA, the police, the Plaintiff’s employer, and the Defendant – of the cause of the accident. The Plaintiff had the benefit of legal advice on one occasion and on another, the document was prepared after the services of lawyers had been retained. If the Plaintiff’s evidence is to be accepted, one would expect these documents to contain a strident complaint that the accident was caused by the Tilt. The silence regarding the Tilt in the four documents is therefore somewhat deafening.
46     Indeed, the Plaintiff’s original position that the cause of the accident was the V Placement is demonstrated by the fact that he only took one photograph of the scene of the accident. The Photograph clearly documents the V Placement, but any tilt, let alone the Tilt, is difficult to discern. It does seem strange that a much closer photograph of the Left Edge was not taken to capture the Tilt if it had been identified as the cause of the accident. Instead, the Photograph was taken at a distance and captures the Plates and the V Placement. In my opinion, the Plaintiff clearly thought that the Photograph was sufficient to document the accident scene and support his theory that the V Placement caused the accident. He must have felt that it was not necessary to secure any further photographic evidence as there were no other aspects of the Plates that he believed, at that time, caused or contributed to the accident. In fact, the evidence goes a step further – the fact that the Plaintiff, after examining the scene, came to the conclusion that it was the V Placement that caused the accident indicates on the balance of probabilities that the Tilt did not exist and was not the cause of the accident. The position that he had taken at trial is therefore a 
volte-face
 from his earlier position.
47     Counsel for the Plaintiff urged me not to consider the inconsistency of the Plaintiff’s oral evidence with the documents produced after the accident as some of the specific documents referred to above had not been put before the Plaintiff during cross-examination. This is a submission premised on the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 (1893) 6 R 67 (“
Browne v Dunn
”). In my view, this is not a proper application of the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
. It is well-established that the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 is ultimately one of fairness (see 
eg
, 
Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292
 at [42]). The rule does not require every point and every document to be put to the witness unless the submission was “at the very heart of the matter”. The Defendant adhered to this rule, having put its case to the Plaintiff in cross-examination that the Tilt did not exist.
[note: 19]
 It would not have been necessary for the Defendant’s counsel to have put each of these documents to the Plaintiff to satisfy the rule as they were in fact adduced by the Plaintiff in support of his case. They were relevant for the court’s assessment of the credibility of the Plaintiff’s testimony on the cause of the accident. It was for the Plaintiff, who had the burden of proving his case on a balance of probabilities, to explain away the inconsistencies in his position, and he did not manage to do so.
48     The question that remains, though not strictly relevant to the disposal of this matter, is why the Plaintiff departed at trial from the documentary evidence concerning the V Placement to the Tilt as the cause of the accident. In my opinion, the likely reason why the Plaintiff’s case shifted was because of the realisation that maintaining the V Placement as the cause of the accident would mean that the Plaintiff had deliberately ridden through the gap in the Plates instead of over one of them. To do so would arguably have been the riskier and less prudent option and the Plaintiff may have believed that such a case in negligence would be weaker. The 
volte-face
 therefore ensued.
Conclusion on the Defendant’s breach of duty
49     In these circumstances, I am inclined to conclude that there was no Tilt as alleged by the Plaintiff. I therefore do not accept the Plaintiff’s evidence on a balance of probabilities that the Tilt existed. Instead, I am satisfied that the Plates were safe for vehicles, including motorcycles, to pass over, even if the Plates were wet at the time of the accident. As the Plates were not inherently dangerous or in an unsafe condition, there was no need for the Defendant to take further precautions either by warning motorists of the presence of the Plates or organising a bypass route around the Plates. The Defendant had discharged its duty of taking reasonable care towards motorists by ensuring that the Plates were safe for motorists to drive over. Consequently, the Plaintiff’s cause of action in negligence failed.
Causation
50     In the event that I am wrong on the issue of breach, I deal also with the question of causation for completeness. Having found above that there was no Tilt as alleged by the Plaintiff, it must follow that the Tilt did not cause the accident. Nor can it be said that any failure by the Defendant to implement a regime to inspect the 
condition
 of the Plates caused or contributed the accident.
51     However, it does raise the issue of whether there were any other causes of the accident or whether it was the Plaintiff’s conduct that resulted in or caused the accident. I deal first with the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendant’s omission to warn motorists of the Plates or organise a bypass route caused or contributed to the accident, before considering whether it was the Plaintiff’s conduct that was the effective cause of the accident.
Did the Defendant’s failure to warn motorist about the Plates cause or contribute to the accident?
52     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to warn motorists of the placement of the Plates. I find it difficult to accept that this in and of itself could have caused or contributed to the accident. The Plaintiff could see the Plates clearly as he approached them. That is evident. It was also the Plaintiff’s evidence that he saw the Plates and slowed down as he approached the Plates.
[note: 20]
 Visibility was clear and the weather was good. It is also evident that there was no traffic in front of or behind the Plaintiff (on the same lane). Accordingly, it would seem that the failure to warn motorists of the placement of the Plates played no part in causing or contributing to the accident. The Plaintiff could see the Plates clearly and did not suddenly come upon them. He hardly needed to be warned that the Plates were on the road. I am therefore of the view that the failure to warn motorists of the Plates did not cause or contribute to the accident. The real issue is not whether the Plaintiff was warned but whether the Plates were in an unsafe condition.
Did the Defendant’s failure to organise a bypass route cause or contribute to the accident?
53     The Plaintiff alleged that the failure to organise a bypass route was an act of negligence that caused or contributed to the accident. This was premised on the existence of the Tilt, such that motorists should have been redirected to avoid the Plates. On top of my earlier observation that this argument is counterintuitive to the very purpose of placing the Plates, I have also found that the Tilt did not exist. Therefore, the basis for the Plaintiff’s allegation falls away.
54     I make some further observations. The Plaintiff, having seen the Plates, was well capable of avoiding them without any assistance from the Defendant. The Plaintiff made much of the presence of a car in the adjacent lane travelling in the opposite direction as a reason why he could not have bypassed the Plates. The Plaintiff’s point was that the car was close to the Plates as the he approached them, thereby making it not possible for the Plaintiff to make a detour around the Plates without waiting for the car to pass.
55     I have difficulty with this position for two reasons. First, I see no reason why the Plaintiff could not have stopped to allow the car to pass so that he could bypass the Plates if he had wanted to do so. That is certainly one scenario if there was an organised detour. Temporary traffic controls would have been put in place to allow motorists to bypass the Plates given that only one lane was available for use. Accordingly, if there was a car in the adjacent lane, it is entirely possible that the Plaintiff would have to stop to allow the car to pass before he could continue his journey. That there was a car in the next lane would not have been an impediment to slowing down to let it pass in order to bypass the Plates. It must again be noted that the car had passed the Plaintiff very quickly suggesting that the Plaintiff could have readily and with little inconvenience circumvented the Plates. The presence of the car or the absence of an organised detour is therefore a red herring in the scheme of things. The decision to traverse the Plates was a conscious decision made by the Plaintiff.
56     Second, I am not altogether convinced that there was in fact a car in the adjacent lane. This was an assertion that surfaced in the course of the Plaintiff’s oral testimony. It is not found in his AEIC. This is surprising given that it was specifically asserted in the Defence that the Plaintiff could have avoided coming into contact with the Plates by slowing down, stopping or swerving. It would seem that if the presence of a car on the adjacent lane prevented the Plaintiff from swerving to avoid the Plates, it would have been specifically addressed in his AEIC. Its absence does raise doubt as to the credibility of the assertion. In the circumstances, however, given my views on why the presence of the car is a non-factor, I do not see the necessity to make a finding on whether there was in fact a car in the adjacent lane.
Did the Plaintiff’s conduct cause or contribute to the accident? 
57     Having considered all the evidence, I am inclined to believe that the accident was caused by the Plaintiff not proceeding with sufficient caution when riding over the Left Plate.
58     The Plaintiff was on duty when the accident occurred. Instead of heading straight to Hendon Camp from Sembawang Camp following his medical examination, he detoured to view a show unit at the Development. While the Plaintiff steadfastly maintained on the stand that the detour was permissible notwithstanding that he was on duty because it was undertaken during the period allowed for his lunch, I am not convinced by the explanation. In this regard, the SAF report is important. It is telling that it makes no mention of a detour to view the show unit in the Development. The Plaintiff agreed that he did not inform Captain Chen that the purpose of the detour was to visit the Development.
[note: 21]
 Instead, he mentioned that he had detoured, 
not for the purpose of viewing the show apartment
, but for refuelling. It is relevant to reproduce what was stated in the SAF report: 
[note: 22]
On 12 Mar at around 1200hrs, serviceman was on his way back [to] camp to report for training from his Dive Medical Check in Sembawang Camp Medical Centre. On the way, he stopped to refuel. After which his motorbike skidded outside a construction site, due to the wet and slippery metal boards placed unevenly on the road.
…
Serviceman was returning to camp to report for official training. He used the 
most direct route
 back, but 
had to detour to refuel
. The accident happened due to the bad condition of the road.
[emphasis added]
59     The unequivocal representation was that the Plaintiff took the direct route from Sembawang Camp to Hendon Camp so that he could report for duty but had to detour to refuel. In other words, the sole purpose of the detour was to refuel. To say that the Plaintiff was being economical with the truth would be to view his statement to Captain Chen with a huge dose of benevolence. The Plaintiff was not taking the most direct route back to Hendon Camp. He did not deviate for the primary purpose of refuelling. The Plaintiff took a convoluted route to Hendon Camp because he in fact detoured to view the show unit.
60     When questioned on why he did not mention the detour in the SAF report, the Plaintiff repeatedly said that he felt that it was not relevant. I found the explanation completely unconvincing. Clearly, the Plaintiff had to explain in the SAF report why the accident took place at a location which was not on the direct route back to Hendon Camp, since he was supposed to be on duty at the material time. In my view, the Plaintiff did not wish to disclose the detour to his employers as he was concerned that such disclosure might be met with disapproval and expose him to a disciplinary issue.
61     The Plaintiff testified that he had to report for the “Closed Quarter Battle Training” exercise at 1.30pm on the day of the incident. That exercise involved 18 other servicemen.
[note: 23]
 When queried on the implications of reporting late, he said he would receive a verbal warning. When further queried on whether the result would be same if he were to tell his commanders that he was late because he had detoured to view a show unit, he said that his commanders would have accepted the reason. I find the Plaintiff’s response difficult to accept. The Plaintiff was a Combat Fit Commando in the commando unit. It is cannot be gainsaid that discipline and punctuality are key pillars of any armed forces, but more so in Special Forces units such as a commando unit. It is difficult to believe that the Plaintiff could have reported late for a designated training exercise without an acceptable excuse. It is equally difficult to believe that a detour to view a show unit would be regarded as an acceptable excuse. The Plaintiff’s contrived attempt to explain the implications of being late for the training exercise served only to underscore my conclusion that the detour would not have been seen favourably by his superiors.
62     The Plaintiff left Sembawang Camp between 11.45am to 11.50am. According to the Plaintiff, the accident occurred at about noon. He had to report to Hendon Camp by 1.30pm. Hendon Camp was some distance from the Development. Taking the Plaintiff’s case at its highest, when the accident occurred, he had barely 1.5 hours to reach the Development, conduct the viewing, have his lunch and travel to Hendon Camp. Time was tight. Given that any tardiness would not be perceived favourably, the Plaintiff must have been under some pressure and perhaps even anxiety when the accident occurred. This would suggest that he proceeded with haste and did not pay sufficient regard to road conditions, in particular the presence of the Plates on the road.
63     The Plaintiff testified that he was travelling at between 20 to 30 km/h as he approached the Plates and at about 20 km/h when he reached the Left Plate. He also testified that he could not have been travelling fast as there was a road hump some distance before the Plate which would have caused him to slow down. While the presence of the road hump could have caused him to slow down, it is entirely possible that he would have sped up as soon as he went over the same especially if he was in a hurry. Further, it is difficult to understand how a motorcycle travelling at 20 km/h and slowing down could have been severely jolted when its front wheel came into contact with the Left Edge (which, as I have found, was not tilted). In this regard, I note that the Plaintiff is an experienced motorcyclist and has been riding a motorcycle since 2003.
[note: 24]
 I am therefore not inclined to accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that he was travelling at the speed of 20 km/h when he attempted to traverse the Left Plate. Given the circumstances, there is a real possibility that the Plaintiff was travelling at a faster speed than he cared to admit when his motorcycle came into contact with the Plates.
64     On the whole, I am of the view that the direct and proximate cause of the accident was the Plaintiff’s conduct in travelling over the Plates with haste and without paying sufficient regard to the road conditions, in particular the presence of the Plates.
Nuisance
65     The issue of nuisance may be dealt with briefly. The Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed during the oral hearing of the closing submissions that the Plaintiff’s cause of action in nuisance was based on the fact that the Plates were placed on the ground in an unsafe condition 
ie
, with the Tilt. Even if I were to assume that the placement of the Plates could be regarded as an act that attracts the tort of nuisance, given my factual finding that the Tilt did not exist, the Plaintiff’s cause of action in nuisance fails.
Breach of statutory duty
66     It should be noted that the parties’ submissions, both written and oral, on the scope and ambit of the Code for the purposes of the tort of breach of statutory duty were thin. Crucially, there were no submissions as to (a) whether a right of private action existed at law which allowed the Plaintiff to sue for breach of statutory duty; and, (b) whether the Code imposed 
statutory
 duties on the Defendant or was instead more of a general guide which identified good practices. In the light of my conclusion that the Plates were in a safe condition and the Defendant’s acts and omissions did not cause the accident, I do not have to consider whether the Code applies. However, for completeness, I make some brief observations.
67     The Code, as its name suggests, is issued under reg 12 of the Regulations. The Regulations are in turn made under the s 53 of the Street Works Act (Cap 320A) (“the Act”). It is clear that the Code is not a part of either the relevant primary or secondary legislation, but is issued by the LTA pursuant to its powers under the Act and the Regulations. It is therefore questionable whether the Code, not being a statutory enactment, imposes 
statutory duties
 at all.
68     Regulation 12(1) provides that:
12.—(1) The Authority may, from time to time, issue a Code of Practice on the carrying out of works on public streets, 
setting out therein such standards, procedures and other requirements
 pertaining to the carrying out of such works as the Authority thinks fit.
[emphasis added]
It is also useful to refer to the scope of the Code as stipulated by para 1-1.1 of the Code:
This Code of Practice 
sets out the standards and procedures for Temporary Traffic Control when carrying out works on public streets
. It gives 
practical guidance
 to users of the code when implementing temporary traffic control needed to do work on public streets and road related facilities. Work activities include but are not limited to bore-hole exploration, excavation, construction, maintenance, utility works and stationing associated construction vehicles and equipment. [emphasis added]
69     In my opinion, the above indicates that the Code was meant to offer practical guidance as to how traffic may be controlled safely and efficiently in a work zone. It was not meant to impose strict legal obligations, much less 
statutory
 obligations that would give rise to a private right of action for breach of statutory duty. Thus, the Plaintiff has failed to even establish a threshold element of his claim in breach of statutory duty, 
viz
, the presence of a relevant statutory duty. Additionally, the Plaintiff has also failed to prove that Parliament intended to confer a private right of action of breach of statutory duty on motorists like the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s cause of action in breach of statutory duty thus fails 
in limine
.
70     Separately, I am also doubtful that the Code applies to the Defendant’s act of placing the Plates on the road at the entrance to the Development. The Code deals specifically with the planning and design of traffic control plans (Chapter 3), the design and application of traffic control devices (Chapter 4) and the implementation, operation, maintenance and removal of traffic control devices (Chapter 5), which appears to contemplate more major works such as excavation and construction, rather than the relatively simple act of laying metal sheets on the roads.
71     For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Plaintiff is not entitled to sue for breach of statutory duty in reliance upon the Code. In any event, the cause of action in breach of statutory duty also fails on the basis of my finding at [52]–[64] above that it was the Plaintiff’s conduct that caused the accident.
Conclusion
72     In these circumstances, I find that:
(a)     the Defendant did not breach its duty to take reasonable care 
vis-à-vis
 the Plaintiff as the Plates were safe for the Plaintiff to ride over and were not tilted or warped as alleged;
(b)     the accident was a result of the Plaintiff’s conduct in proceeding with haste over the Left Plate and without regard to presence of the Plates.
73     Even if I am incorrect in my conclusion that the accident was caused by the Plaintiff’s conduct, the burden is on the Plaintiff to show that the Defendant’s acts and omissions were a breach of a duty of care or statutory duty and that these breaches caused the Plaintiff’s injuries and damage. In the light of my conclusions above, the Plaintiff has failed to discharge that burden.
74     For these reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim with costs to be taxed if not agreed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 20 October 2008, the applicant was found guilty by a jury of 9 counts of obtain a financial advantage by deception (the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), s 134.2(1)); 6 counts of attempt to obtain a financial advantage by deception (the Criminal Code Act, ss 11.1 and 134.2(1)); and 1 count of deal with proceeds of crime (count 17 of the indictment) being $100,000 or more (the Criminal Code Act, s 400.4(1)). 
     
      
    2 All offences except count 17 related to the lodging of business activity statements with the Australian Taxation Office which claimed false Goods and Services Tax refunds. Count 17 related to using the proceeds of the funds obtained as a result of the first 9 counts. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 134.2(1) is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 400.4(1) is 20 years imprisonment or 1,200 penalty units ($132,000), or both. 
     
      
    5 On 1 May 2009, Ainsley-Wallace DCJ sentenced the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2012.  
     
      
    6 The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in determining that general deterrence was a factor in determining the sentence or alternatively gave undue weight to the principles of general deterrence; 
       
       
      Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances; 
       
       
      Ground 3: the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence for count 17 that was not wholly concurrent with counts 1 to 15.  
       
      
    7 At the commencement of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, counsel for the applicant informed the Court that grounds 1 and 2 were abandoned.  
     
      
    8 The Crown had already indicated in its written submissions dated 28 June 2010, that it conceded ground 3. The Crown accepted that this would involve a reduction in both the total sentence and the non-parole period. The Crown also accepted that in any re-sentence exercise, it was appropriate for the Court to maintain the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period as had been ordered by the trial judge. 
     
      
    9 The Court considered that the Crown had properly conceded ground 3 and that the sentence on count 17 should be quashed and the appellant re-sentenced in respect of that count so that it ended on the same date as the last sentence otherwise imposed by her Honour. The non-parole period correspondingly needed adjustment. Accordingly, the Court made orders at the conclusion of the appeal to that effect. Those orders are formalised below.  
     
      
    10 Notwithstanding that ground 3 was conceded by the Crown, it is appropriate that we say something about it.  
     
      
    11 Count 17 charged the applicant with a money laundering offence which arose out of the same facts as the other offences with which she was charged. There have been at least three cases before the Court in the last year where the Court has criticised the prosecution practice of charging offenders in this way. To the credit of the Crown Prosecutor in this case, he brought those cases to our attention and made the concession to which we have referred.  
     
      
    12 The problem was adverted to in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294, when Howie J pointed out that money laundering offences were intended by the legislature to be directed at activity where persons were intimately involved in dealing in money that was the result of some other person’s criminal activity, so as to hide its source.  
     
      
    13 Shortly after Thorn, this Court delivered its decision in Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58. In that case, the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six offences contrary to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the decoder offences) concerning the sale of, or offering to sell, unauthorised decoders. The relevant provisions of that Act were ss 135ASB(1) and 135ASC(1). The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to the Criminal Code Act, s 400.6(1). That section is concerned with dealing in the proceeds of crime. The decoder offences each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The offence of dealing in the proceeds of crime carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The applicant, on a plea of guilty, was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years, to be served by way of periodic detention, on the copyright offences. Relevantly for present purposes, however, on the money laundering offence, he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    14 The Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Rothman JJ) referred first to Thorn and noted, at [14], that there was a basis in that case for the money laundering charge: 
     
      
       
        
        “… because it captured criminality of the applicant’s co-offender, who had never been charged and yet was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Court then stated, importantly, at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.” 
        
       
      
    16 Those remarks apply in this case to count 17. However, it is important to re-emphasise this Court’s disapproval of such prosecutorial action. The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that he has brought this issue to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. We note that the charges in this case were laid and the trial conducted and sentences passed well before the decisions to which we have referred were given. Nonetheless, the matter is of such importance that we consider a copy of these remarks should be brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    17 We confirm the orders of the Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentence imposed with respect to count 17 and, by way of re-sentence, impose a sentence of 2 years imprisonment to start on 20 October 2012 and conclude on 19 October 2014; 
       
       
      4. Quash the non-parole period specified by the sentencing judge and set a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months to conclude on 19 March 2012.

Lord Hughes: 

R -v- Asiedu 

The  applicant  renews  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  his  conviction  for 
conspiracy  to  cause  explosions  likely  to  endanger  life  or  to  cause  serious  injury  to 
property, after refusal by the single judge.  He had pleaded guilty to this offence at his 
re-trial in November 2007.  He had previously been tried together with others on an 
indictment  charging  both  conspiracy  to  murder  and  this  offence,  arising  from  the 
same alleged conduct. At the end of a long trial in July 2007, the jury had convicted 
others, but had been unable to agree about this applicant.  Upon his plea of guilty to 
this  offence  at  the  outset  of  the  re-trial,  the  Crown  did  not  ask  for  a  re-trial  of  the 
graver alternative count, nor of count four which charged possession of an explosive 
substance with intent.  His contention that his conviction is unsafe is grounded upon 
complaints of lack of proper disclosure by the Crown of material relating to scientific 
evidence, and associated criticism of the evidence of one of the scientists called by the 
Crown at the effective (first) trial. 

The charges against this applicant and his five co-accused arose out of the taking of 
home-made bombs onto the London Transport system on 21 July 2005.  That was two 
weeks after terrorist suicide bombers had exploded bombs on underground trains and 
a bus on 7th July, causing some fifty-two deaths.  The case against the applicant and 
his co-accused was that they had similarly taken home-made bombs onto underground 
trains  and  buses.    The  bombs  were  contained  in  rucksacks,  and  were  triggered  by 
battery-driven  electric  devices  which  fired  home-made  detonators  when  an  electric 
circuit was completed by the wearer.  On 21 July there were five such bombs, taken 
separately by five of the six defendants from a common starting point in west London 
onto  either  trains  or  buses.    Four  of  those  devices  were  activated  by  four  of  the 
applicant’s  co-accused,  called  Omar,  Osman,  Mohammed  and  Ibrahim.    Omar 
activated his on a Victoria Line train in the tunnel approaching Warren Street Station.  
Osman activated his on a train near to Shepherd’s Bush station.  Mohammed activated 
his device on a northern line train between Stockwell and the Oval.  Ibrahim activated 
his on a number 26 bus in Hackney. In each of these cases, the electric circuit when 
completed successfully fired the home-made detonator, but the detonator did not set 
off the bulk charge. There was a bang, and some resultant confusion, but no major 
explosion.  The fifth device was carried by Asiedu. He abandoned it in some parkland 
in Little Wormwood Scrubs.   

The Crown case was that this was a plot to explode bombs which would kill.  The 
devices, which were recovered, were all of the same construction.  The bulk charge 
(which  failed  to  explode)  was  made  of  domestic  ingredients,  flour  and  hydrogen 
peroxide.  The detonators were all the same, comprising high explosive primers made 
from household materials publicly available.  The electric firing devices were again 
the same and similarly home-made.  Packed around the bulk charges was shrapnel, in 
the form of bolts, screws, washers or tacks, such as would increase the injuries in the 
event  of  explosion.    Because  in  the  event  the  bulk  charges  did  not  explode,  the 
carriers  were  able  initially  to  escape  in  the  confusion,  but  some  could  be  seen, 
undisguised, on CCTV and one had left clear evidence of his identity in his rucksack.  
They were arrested one by one in Birmingham, London and Rome. The police rapidly 
identified two London flats as having been used by them, one at Curtis House in north 
London and one in the west at Dalgarno Gardens near Ladbroke Grove.

R -v- Asiedu 

Asiedu  when  arrested  gave  long  police  interviews.    What  he  said  was  very  largely 
untruthful; he lied about who he was and about knowing the other defendants; he said 
he knew nothing at all about the bombs; he denied having anything to do with buying 
the hydrogen peroxide.  As to the day when the bombs were set off, he asserted a false 
alibi.  A police officer had to go to Ghana to establish the truth about his identity.  

In  the  weeks  and  months  after  the  arrests,  the  police  were  able  to  assemble  clear 
evidence  that  Asiedu  had  been  instrumental  in  the  purchase  of  some  442  litres  of 
hydrogen  peroxide  from  several  different  suppliers,  lying  to  the  sellers  about  the 
purpose  for  which  it  was  required.    He  was  shown  to  have  asked  for  70% 
concentration if available, but ordinarily the product is sold only at 18%, and that is 
what he had been able to get.  There was then evidence from Curtis House that the 
peroxide had been cooked in the kitchen, and concentrated from this 18% solution.  
There  were  rotas  for  this  cooking  duty,  and  notes  of  the  specific  gravity  achieved, 
which  indicated  a  strength  in  the  region  of  70%.    There  was  much  other  evidence 
uncovered connected with the construction of the bombs by the defendants. 

Sometime towards the end of 2006, over a year after the event and when the trial was 
imminent,  the  first  four  defendants  (but  not  Asiedu)  served  amended  defence  case 
statements.  In them, they asserted for the first time that they had indeed made the 
bombs, but that they had always intended that they should not explode; rather they 
were hoaxes intended to frighten or to make a political statement about UK actions in 
Iraq.  The trial had to be delayed for this hoax assertion to be investigated.  Much 
later,  during  the  trial,  the  other  defendants,  through  Ibrahim,  advanced  a  further 
assertion not previously contained in their defence statements, namely that they had 
concentrated  the  hydrogen  peroxide  to  about  70%,  but  having  done  so,  watered  it 
down by adding an equal volume of water, thus reducing the strength to around 35%.  
It was their positive case that the bombs were constructed of a mixture of flour and 
hydrogen peroxide, in proportions of roughly 1:2.   

At a late stage in the trial Asiedu went to some lengths to distance himself from the 
other defendants.  Inconsistently with his previous stance, and with a letter which he 
had written to Ibrahim’s sister whilst awaiting trial saying that all the defendants were 
totally innocent, his case underwent a sea change after the Crown case was closed and 
Ibrahim had given evidence in chief.   His case as put to Ibrahim in cross examination 
was that Ibrahim had, personally and via his solicitors, put pressure on him in prison 
to  change  his  solicitor  and  to  adopt  the  hoax  defence.    Consistently  with  his 
instructions,  leading  counsel  roundly  attacked  the  hoax  assertion  as  absurd.    By 
contrast,  his  defence,  which  he  supported  by  evidence  on  oath,  was  that  there  had 
been a plan to make real bombs, but that he had learned of it only the night before 
they  were  deployed,  and  he  was  never  a  party  to  it.    He  had  earlier  bought  the 
hydrogen peroxide innocently, believing that the others were using it for painting and 
decorating, or, later, that they were making cosmetics.  Later Ibrahim had told him 
that the others were making “firecrackers”, but he was never party to such a plan. On 
the  night  before  the  bombs  were  detonated  he  was  with  the  others  in  Dalgarno 
Gardens and realised for the first time that they were talking about a suicide bombing 
mission  and  expected  him  to  take  part.    He  was  afraid  to  voice  his  disagreement 
because the others were now seen to be terrorists who would kill him, so he bided his 
time, and when once separated from them, abandoned his device in the park in Little 
Wormwood Scrubs.

After  the  jury  disagreed  in  his  case,  but  had  convicted  the  first  four  defendants, 
Asiedu  was  re-tried  some  four  months  later.    At  the  outset  of  his  re-trial,  having 
sought in open court information from the judge as to the range of likely sentence in 
such  event,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  the  lesser  alternative  count  of  conspiracy  to  cause 
explosions  likely  to  endanger  life  or  to  cause  serious  damage  to  property.    The 
tendering of this plea of guilty followed detailed discussions between his lawyers and 
those acting for the Crown.  He asserts that the Crown initiated them, but it does not 
matter who did so; he was represented then, as now, by tenacious leading and junior 
counsel plus solicitors.  Prior to tendering his plea, a detailed statement of the factual 
basis for it was prepared on his behalf, discussed with the Crown, and submitted to 
the judge so that a sentence indication might be given.  It ran to three pages.  In it he 
said (amongst other things) that: 

i) 

ii) 

he  had  agreed  in  March  2005  to  take  part  in  making  bombs  by  buying  the 
hydrogen peroxide;  he was reluctant but did as asked;  he appreciated that any 
explosion  of  the  bombs  would  be  likely  to  endanger  life  and  that  he  thus 
committed the offence charged in count 2 from March 2005; 

at  this  time  he  was  living  at  Curtis  House  with  Omar,  as  he  was  for  the 
majority, but not all, of the period from March to the deployment of the bombs 
in July;  he had been aware of the cooking of the hydrogen peroxide in the 
kitchen;  he had not personally taken part in this activity, but continued to buy 
the peroxide for the process; and 

iii) 

at  Dalgarno  Gardens  overnight  on  20/21  July  he  had  learned  of  a  planned 
suicide mission the next day;  he had refused to be one of the suicide bombers 
but had helped to mix the materials to make one of the five bombs.   

9. 

On  20  November  2007  Asiedu  was  sentenced  to  33  years  imprisonment  for  the 
offence  to  which  he  had  pleaded  guilty.    An  application  to  this  court  for  leave  to 
appeal  that  sentence  was  refused  on  10  July  2008  (Sir  Igor  Judge  P,  Rafferty  and 
Grigson JJ).  

Scientific evidence and disclosure 

The  deployment  of  these  bombs  took  place  just  a  fortnight  after  the  fatal  suicide 
attacks on the London transport system of 7th July had killed and injured a very large 
number  of  people.    The  use  of  home-made  starch/peroxide  bombs  was  new  at  the 
time, and expertise in such material was scarce.  The Forensic Explosives Laboratory 
(“FEL”) could undertake some of the necessary reporting work, but it seems that it 
was  not  in  a  position  to  deal  with  analysis  of  the  content  of  the  devices.    In 
consequence,  Dr  Black,  who  was  an  academic  expert  in  isotopic  analysis  without 
experience  of  trial  (forensic)  work  was  instructed  to  undertake  this  analysis.    The 
present  application  for  leave  to  appeal  is  built  entirely  around  the  evidence  of  this 
expert. In due course his was by no means the only scientific evidence at the trial.  
Very  important  evidence  was  given  by  FEL  scientists  as  to  the  potential  of 
flour/peroxide mixtures of various recipes to explode and as to the manufacture and 
potency of the detonators.  But Dr Black’s evidence was relied on by the Crown and 
was  in  parts  challenged  by  the  defendants  other  than  Asiedu.  In  particular,  his 
evidence refuted the re-dilution assertion when it appeared during the trial.

The particular issues which Dr Black was initially asked to address were these: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

the composition of the starch/peroxide residues recovered from the bombs; 

the origin of the starch; 

whether the bombs were made from a single mix or from a number of mixes 
made independently; 

whether there was or was not scientific evidence that the bombs were prepared 
at Curtis House and/or Dalgarno Gardens; 

whether there was or was not scientific evidence of concentration of peroxide 
at either address. 

12. 

Dr  Black  produced  a  first  report  in  June  2006.  He  had  proceeded  by  way  of  (1) 
isotopic  analysis,  (2)  chemical  analysis  of 
trace  elements,  (3)  microscopic 
examination,  (4)  Xray  diffraction,  and  (5)  Xray  fluorescence.    At  the  end  of  a 
substantial report, his stated summary of conclusions read, omitting inessential detail, 
as follows: 

“7.1  Isotopic analysis of the scene residues found on 21 July 
2005 show them to be flour-hydrogen peroxide mixtures. 

  Isotopic  analysis  of  all 

7.2 
the  scene  residues  and 
commercially available flour types shows the flour used in the 
devices was similar to control sample GL12, labelled chapatti 
flour, and the control FUDCO chapatti flour GDA 353. 

7.3  X  ray  diffraction  analysis  of  the  scene  residues  also 
supports  the  isotopic  analysis  and  shows  the  incorporation  of 
inorganic components to the residues which are consistent with 
stabilisers from the hydrogen peroxide. 

7.4  Lead isotopic analysis of all the scene residues show them 
to  be  identical  to  one  another  [and]….  to  residues  recovered 
from the bins at Curtis House and from Curtis House. 

7.5  Trace  element  analysis  of  the  scene  residues  shows  clear 
links to cooking pans at Curtis House….. 

7.6  Physical  shapes  and  structures  of  …residue  found  [at] 
Curtis  House  show  them  [sic]  to  be  identical  to  those  from 
scene  residues  originating  from  Warren  Street,  No  26  bus, 
Shepherd’s  Bush,  the  bins  at  Curtis  House,  The  Oval  and  58 
Curtis House. 

7.7  There is thus scientific evidence to suggest that the devices 
were prepared at Curtis House. 

7.8  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the devices 
were prepared at …Dalgarno Gardens.

7.10  Analysis of the isotopic data for the hydrogen peroxide, 
scene residues and control flour materials suggests a mixture of 
between approximately 68-74% hydrogen peroxide was used at 
a  strength  between  approximately  3  and  4  times  the  initial 
concentration (between 54-72%).” 

This report was seen by forensic scientists working at the FEL who, whether or not 
directly  concerned  in  the  case,  were  concerned  that  some  conclusions  appeared  to 
them to be unjustified. Within the service there was a system for such concerns to be 
made known to the Head of the Laboratory, and if appropriate via him to others, in 
order to avert any risk of a potential miscarriage of justice.  The procedure set out in 
the  laboratory  quality  manual  (section  9  paragraph  3)  shows  that  this  is  a  system 
rightly  taken  seriously.    Where  anything  emerges  which  might  indicate  that  a  past 
miscarriage  of  justice  has  occurred,  its  stated  aim  is  to  enable  the  information  to 
reach,  by  one  route  or  another,  the  Criminal  Cases  Review  Commission.    Where 
something emerges which might have the potential to cause a future miscarriage of 
justice, then its stated aim is to ensure that it is corrected and the correction provided 
to  anyone  outside  the  laboratory  to  whom  uncorrected  material  has  been  given.   
Defence teams who have been given information which needs correction are, rightly, 
identified in the manual as examples of those in the latter situation. 

It  is  now  known  that  particular  officers  of  the  FEL  prepared,  first,  a  document 
beginning  “Is  Dr  Black’s  report  fit  for  purpose?”  (“the  fit  for  purpose  document”) 
and, second, draft comments on his report (“the draft comments document”) .  The 
second was certainly sent in electronic copy to the principal forensic scientist dealing 
with this case, Mr Todd.  It is also now clear that the gist of the concerns expressed in 
these  documents  was  communicated  orally  (i)  to  Dr  Black  at  a  meeting  with  other 
scientists (including Mr Todd) on 13 November 2006, attended by two police officers 
and  (ii)  to  counsel  at  a  visit  they  made  to  the  FEL  and  subsequently  at  a  case 
conference, both on 22 November.  As part of that conference there was a telephone 
conversation between Mr Hill QC (then first junior counsel for the Crown) and Dr 
Black, at which some queries arising from the expressed concerns were discussed.  

The  outcome  of  this  was  that  Dr  Black  wrote  two  additional  witness  statements  in 
December 2006, both duly served on all parties and forming to a large part the basis 
of his evidence in due course at the trial.  The first was entitled an “amendment” to his 
original  statement.    It  began  by  saying  that  “a  number  of  errors  occurred  in  the 
original report”, and offered his apology.  It went on to re-work some paragraphs of 
his  original  report  in  a  way  which  to  an  extent  altered  their  import,  including 
subparagraphs 7.2 and 7.10 of the conclusions which we have set out at paragraph 12 
above. The second was a substantial addendum statement, setting out a good deal of 
further work and the conclusions which he drew from it.  Thereafter the defendants 
instructed a scientific expert, Professor Michels, who met Dr Black on one or more 
occasions  and  discussed  his  conclusions  with  him  and  who  in  due  course  gave 
evidence at the trial, differing in some respects from him.  Both addressed the late-
appearing re-dilution assertion.  

16. 

Although Dr Black thus corrected his first report, and added to it, what did not happen 
was the disclosure to the defence of either the Fit for Purpose document or the Draft
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

Comments document.  Both were, we are satisfied, clearly disclosable.  We consider 
below, to the extent appropriate without re-hearing scientific evidence, what impact in 
the  end  any  of  the  concerns  might  have  had  at  the  trial  of  the  six  defendants  who 
included Asiedu.  But whatever hindsight may now tell us about that question, those 
two documents plainly had at least the potential to be of assistance to the defence as 
possibly undermining a part of the Crown case, namely some, though by no means all, 
of Dr Black’s conclusions.  As such, they fell to be disclosed to the defence.  It is true 
of course that Dr Black’s amendment statement clearly stated that he acknowledged 
errors and was correcting them, so that the defence was not only on notice that he had 
made errors but also could see which conclusions he agreed involved error.  But this 
did not obviate the disclosability of the two documents.  It would be for the defence to 
examine,  on  its  own  terms,  whether  the  corrections  adequately  met  the  criticisms, 
whether the final conclusions ought to be challenged or not, and whether or not Dr 
Black’s general standing as an expert witness ought to be challenged. Moreover, the 
amendment  statement,  whilst  it  corrected  the  first,  said  nothing  about  the  errors 
having been drawn to Dr Black’s attention by others and to that extent did not provide 
the defence with the same potential ammunition that ought to have been available to 
them.  And since Dr Black adhered to some conclusions about which the FEL critics 
had expressed doubt, there was in those cases no correction and therefore also neither 
acknowledgement nor disclosure of peer criticism.   

The  factual  position  which  we  have  been  able  to  set  out  above  has,  even  now, 
emerged only piece by piece. In January 2013, in response to the present application 
for leave to appeal and to grounds which raised the issue of the FEL concerns, the 
Crown properly traced and disclosed the key documents, namely the Fit for Purpose 
document and the Draft Comments document (the two principal documents) together 
with  the  notes  of  the  meeting  on  13  November  2006.    The  case  conference  of  22 
November, however, emerged only at the two day hearing before us some two years 
later in February 2015.  That led leading counsel for the applicant understandably to 
seek further assurance that full disclosure had now been made, and indeed he went on 
to raise a query as to the good faith of those representing the Crown. He asked us to 
order  an  independent  enquiry  into  the  disclosure  history  by  fresh  counsel.    We 
concluded that that was not called for, but in response to his concerns we ordered, 
after the hearing before us was otherwise completed, a further disclosure investigation 
and specifically required to know whether either of the two principal documents had 
been seen by counsel, solicitors, or the police officers present at the case conference.  
We have been told that the necessary records have been exhumed from storage and 
inspected by their authors.  There is no sign that any of those persons saw either of the 
two  documents  and  none  has  any  recollection  of  doing  so.    There  is  no  reason  to 
doubt this information, nor the good faith of those who have provided it.  The case 
conference was not only, or even principally, about Dr Black.  The notes of it do not 
suggest that the relevant discussion was conducted over a document, rather than being 
initiated by an oral report of topics of concern.  Its outcome was that further work was 
to be done, and that two further statements would be made, one a correction and the 
other an update or addendum.   

That does not alter the facts that (a) the two principal documents were not identified 
as apt for disclosure pre-trial, as plainly they should have been, and (b) the discussion 
at the case conference of part of material which derived from them was produced only 
at the hearing before us, eight years or so after the trial, and only after specific request

for  its  disclosure.    We  are  satisfied  that  the  first  was  a  clear  failure  of  the  duty  of 
disclosure.    If  disclosure  of  the  two  principal  documents  and  of  the  gist  of  the  13 
November discussion had been made, as it should have been, there would probably 
have  been  no  occasion  for  disclosure  of  the  telephone  conversation  at  the  case 
conference.  As it is, the late emergence of the latter has lent some limited colour to 
the applicant’s assertion that there has been a deliberate cover-up. Having considered 
detailed  additional  written  submissions  made  after  the  hearing  on  behalf  of  the 
applicant, we see no evidence of this.  We are, however, on an application for leave to 
appeal  against  conviction,  concerned  solely  with  the  safety  of  the  conviction.    We 
therefore need in any event to consider the relevance of non-disclosure, of whatever 
kind, to that issue. That involves considering (i) the applicant’s plea of guilty and (ii) 
the  significance  of  the  undisclosed  material.    We  have  heard  argument  about  both 
matters.   

The plea of guilty    

A defendant who pleads guilty is making a formal admission in open court that he is 
guilty of the offence.  He may of course by a written basis of plea limit his admissions 
to only some of the facts alleged by the Crown, so long as he is admitting facts which 
constitute the offence, and Asiedu did so here. But ordinarily, once he has admitted 
such facts by an unambiguous and deliberately intended plea of guilty, there cannot 
then be an appeal against his conviction, for the simple reason that there is nothing 
unsafe about a conviction based on the defendant’s own voluntary confession in open 
court.    A  defendant  will  not  normally  be  permitted  in  this  court  to  say  that  he  has 
changed his mind and now wishes to deny what he has previously thus admitted in the 
Crown Court.  

It does not follow that a plea of guilty is always a bar to the quashing by this court of 
a conviction.  Leaving aside equivocal or unintended pleas (which do not concern us 
here), there are two principal cases in which it is not.  The first is where the plea of 
guilty was compelled as a matter of law by an adverse ruling by the trial judge which 
left no arguable defence to be put before the jury.  So, if the judge rules as a matter of 
law that on the defendant’s own case, that is on agreed or assumed facts, the offence 
has been committed, there is no arguable defence which the defendant can put before 
the  jury.    In  that  situation  he  can  plead  guilty  and  challenge  the  adverse  ruling  by 
appeal to this court.  If the ruling is adjudged to have been wrong, the conviction is 
likely to be quashed.  Contrast the situation where an adverse ruling at the trial (for 
example as to the admissibility of evidence) renders the defence being advanced more 
difficult, perhaps dramatically so.  There, the ruling does not leave the defendant no 
case to advance to the jury.  He remains able, despite the evidence against him, to 
advance  his  defence  and,  if  convicted,  to  challenge  the  judicial  ruling  as  to 
admissibility by way of appeal. If he chooses to plead guilty, he will be admitting the 
facts which constitute the offence and it will be too late to mount an appeal to this 
court.  For this important distinction see R v Chalkley & Jeffries [1997] EWCA Crim 
3416; [1998] 2 Cr App R 79, which on this point is clear law.  That was a case in 
which  the  defendants  had  failed  to  persuade  the  trial  judge  to  exclude  evidence 
pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and, faced with 
evidence which they judged to be difficult to overcome, had pleaded guilty, indeed in 
explicit terms which made it clear that they now admitted the conspiracy to rob which 
was charged.  Giving the court’s judgment, Auld LJ said this at 94D: 

19. 

20.
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

“Thus,  a  conviction  would  be  unsafe  where  the  effect  of  an 
incorrect  ruling  of  law  on  admitted  facts  was  to  leave  an 
accused with no legal escape from a verdict of guilty on those 
facts. But a conviction would not normally be unsafe where an 
accused  is  influenced  to  change  his  plea  to  guilty  because  he 
recognises that, as a result of a ruling to admit strong evidence 
against him, his case on the facts is hopeless. A change of plea 
to guilty in such circumstance would normally be regarded as 
an  acknowledgment  of  the  truth  of  the  facts  constituting  the 
offence charged.” 

21. 

The  second  situation  in  which  a  plea  of  guilty  will  not  prevent  an  appeal  is  where 
even if on the admitted or assumed facts the defendant was guilty, there was a legal 
obstacle to his being tried for the offence. That will be true in those cases, rare as they 
are,  where  his  prosecution  would  be  stayed  on  the  grounds  that  it  is  offensive  to 
justice to bring him to trial.  Such cases are generally described, conveniently if not 
entirely accurately, as cases of ‘abuse of process’.  The classical example of such is R 
v Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court ex p Bennett [1994] AC 42 and later [1995] 1 
Cr App R 147, where the defendant had been charged in England after being illegally 
routed here from a foreign country with which there was no extradition treaty.  His 
committal for trial was quashed and the prosecution was stayed.  In the subsequent 
similar case of Mullen [1999] 2 Cr App R 143, where the prosecution had proceeded 
to conviction after trial, that conviction was quashed.  As this court there said,  

“.  .  .  for  a  conviction  to  be  safe,  it  must  be  lawful;  and  if  it 
results from a trial which should never have taken place, it can 
hardly be regarded as safe.” 

By parity of reasoning, if the trial process should never have taken place because it is 
offensive to justice, a conviction upon a plea of guilty is as unsafe as one following 
trial. 

22. 

Chalkley was not such a case, and the court there went too far in offering, obiter, the 
opinion  that  a  plea  of  guilty  would  prevent  an  appeal  even  in  such  circumstances. 
That dictum was inconsistent with the reasoning in the later case of Mullen (although 
there had been no plea of guilty there) and it was corrected in Togher [2000] EWCA 
Crim 111; [2001] 1 Cr App R 457.  There this court referred to the ratio of Chalkley 
as set out above at paragraph 20 and said: 

“We would not wish to question this passage in the judgment of 
Auld LJ.  However, it cannot be applied to the situation which 
exists here, where the defendants were unaware of the material 
matters alleged to amount to an abuse of process. If they could 
establish  an  abuse,  then  this  Court  would  give  very  serious 
consideration  to  whether  justice  required  the  conviction  to  be 
set  aside.  We  would,  however,  emphasise 
the 
circumstances  where  it  can  be  said  that  the  proceedings 
constitute an abuse of process are closely confined. The reason 
for this is that the majority of improprieties in connection with 
bringing  proceedings  can  be  satisfactorily  dealt  with  by  the 
court  exercising  its  power  of  control  over  the  proceedings.  It

23. 

has to be a situation where it would be inconsistent with the due 
administration of justice to allow the pleas of guilty to stand.” 

And the court had earlier made clear that: 

“Certainly,  if  it  would  be  right  to  stop  a  prosecution  on  the 
basis that it was an abuse of process, this Court would be most 
unlikely to conclude that if there was a conviction despite this 
fact, the conviction should not be set aside.” 

That  position  was  further  endorsed  by  this  court  in  the  later  case  of  Early  [2002] 
EWCA Crim 1904; [2003] 1 Cr App R 19.  The case arose from the notorious London 
City Bond investigations into evasion of duty upon bonded goods.  The appellants had 
all pleaded guilty, in several cases after applications for a stay on grounds of abuse of 
process  had  failed.    Those  applications  had  been  made  on  the  basis  of  entrapment 
which is, of course, no defence but may be grounds for a stay:  see R v Latif  [1996] 
UKHL 16;  [1996] 1 WLR 104.  Subsequently it transpired that a key manager at the 
bonded warehouse, who was a Crown witness, had been a participating informer, that 
he had lied on oath about this and other matters to the knowledge of the investigators 
who had not revealed the lie, that the judge had been given false information about his 
status, and that that the investigators had facilitated offences, in other words that there 
had indeed been entrapment.  

24. 

This court approached the appeals in accordance with Mullen and Togher.  Rose LJ 
first made some general remarks as to the gravity of perjury in PII or abuse of process 
hearings.  He said this: 

“Judges can only make decisions and counsel can only act and 
advise  on  the  basis  of  the  information  with  which  they  are 
provided. The integrity of our system of criminal trial depends 
on judges being able to rely on what they are told by counsel 
and on counsel being able to rely on what they are told by each 
other. This is particularly crucial in relation to disclosure and 
Pll hearings. Accordingly, Mr Gompertz QC, rightly, accepted 
that  when  defence  counsel  advised  Rahul,  Nilam  Patel  and 
Pearcy  as  to  plea,  they  were  entitled  to  assume  that  full  and 
proper  disclosure  had  already  been  made.  He  also  rightly 
accepted that a defendant who pleaded guilty at an early stage 
should not, if adequate disclosure had not by then been made, 
be  in  a  worse  position  than  a  defendant  who,  as  the 
consequence of an argument to stay proceedings as an abuse, 
benefited from further orders for disclosure culminating in the 
abandonment of proceedings against him. Furthermore, in our 
judgment,  if,  in  the  course  of  a  PII  hearing  or  an  abuse 
argument,  whether  on  the  voir  dire  or  otherwise,  prosecution 
witnesses lie in evidence to the judge, it is to be expected that, 
if the judge knows of this, or this court subsequently learns of 
it, an extremely serious view will be taken. It is likely that the 
prosecution  case  will  be 
tainted  beyond 
redemption, however strong the evidence against the defendant 
may otherwise be. Such an approach is consistent with the view 

regarded  as
--------

expressed by this court, in Edwards [1996] 2 CAR 345 @ 350F 
where,  in  a  different  context,  Beldam  LJ  referred  to  the 
suspicion  of  perjury  starting  to  infect  the  evidence  and 
permeate  other  similar  cases  in  which  the  witnesses  are 
involved.” 

The ratio of the case appears from what follows immediately: 

“We  approach  the  question  of  safety  of  these  convictions, 
following pleas of guilty, in accordance with Mullen [1999] 2 
Cr App R 143 as approved in Togher & others [2001] 1 Cr App 
R 457, namely a conviction is generally unsafe if a defendant 
has  been  denied  a  fair  trial.  We  bear  in  mind,  in  particular, 
three  observations  by  Lord  Woolf  CJ  in  Togher.  First,  at 
paragraph 30, “if it would be right to stop a prosecution on the 
basis that it was an abuse of process, this court would be most 
unlikely to conclude that, if there was a conviction despite this 
fact,  the  conviction  should  not  be  set  aside”.  Secondly,  at 
paragraph 33, “The circumstances where it can be said that the 
proceedings constitute an abuse of process are closely confined. 
It has to be a situation where it would be inconsistent with the 
due  administration  of  justice  to  allow  the  pleas  of  guilty  to 
stand”. Thirdly, at paragraph 59, freely entered pleas of guilty 
will not be interfered with by this court unless the prosecution’s 
misconduct is of a category which justifies this. A plea of guilty 
is binding unless the defendant was ignorant of evidence going 
to innocence or guilt. Ignorance of material which goes merely 
to  credibility  of  a  prosecution  witness  does  not  justify 
reopening a plea of guilty.” 

25. 

It is clear from the sentences which directly follow the reference to a defendant being 
denied  a  fair  trial  that  Rose  LJ  was,  consistently  with  principle,  in  this  context 
referring to the case of abuse of process such as renders it unfair to try the defendant 
at all.  Entrapment, if made out, can be an example of such unfairness. The court was 
clearly satisfied that the defendants who had pleaded guilty had been deprived of a 
stay on such grounds.  

26. 

In the present case, the submission of Mr Kamlish QC for the applicant is that:  

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

the non-disclosure of the FEL documents was an abuse of process, moreover 
one committed in bad faith; 

Dr Black committed perjury at least at one point in his evidence when asked to 
explain something which had been in his original report and was removed by 
the amendment in December; 

had the non-disclosure been exposed before or during the trial the proceedings 
would have ended by order of the court (it seems by way of stay) and there 
would  never  have  been  a  second  trial  or  occasion  for  the  applicant  to  plead 
guilty;

iv) 

v) 

vi) 

alternatively  but  for  the  non-disclosure  the  applicant  might  have  been 
acquitted at the trial; 

the  non-disclosure  led  to  the  applicant  being  misled  by  the  Crown  and  to 
pleading guilty to a false case; 

the applicant was deprived of any real choice but to plead guilty, and his plea 
was accordingly a nullity; and 

vii) 

in the circumstances, the plea was not a true confession to the offence. 

 Carefully presented as they are, these submissions are unarguable.  Non-disclosure is 
not by itself an abuse of the process of the court.  It is a failure of duty on the part of 
the prosecution as a whole.  It may in some cases be serious.  A conviction after trial 
may be unsafe if material was left undisclosed, especially (but not only) if it provided 
a defence;  R v Barkshire [2011] EWCA Crim 1885 and  R v Bard  [2014] EWCA 
Crim 463, cited to us, were examples.  But non-disclosure does not by itself amount to 
a  circumstance  making  it  unfair  to  put  the  defendant  on  trial  at  all  and  it  does  not 
afford grounds for a stay.  The remedy for non-disclosure will ordinarily be orders for 
the  defendant  to  be  provided  with  the  necessary  material,  and  such  order  as  will 
ensure  that  he  is  not  unfairly  damaged  by  its  late  delivery.    Usually  the  trial  can 
proceed fairly.  Sometimes, if the material emerges late, a re-trial may be necessary if 
the  defendant  seeks  it;  in  others  he  may  judge  that  he  will  be  better  served  by 
continuing the trial and making a point of the Crown’s failures.  But there is nothing 
akin to the kind of misbehaviour which characterises either the ex p Bennett type of 
case, or others of gross executive misconduct of a kind which makes it offensive to 
justice to put the defendant on trial at all.   

This is well illustrated by Togher.  After the defendants had entered pleas of guilty, it 
had emerged at a linked re-trial that there had been concealment by the investigators 
of breaches of internal guidance for surveillance and that false assurances had been 
given by counsel to the trial judge to the effect that authority for the surveillance had 
been  obtained.    In  the  context  of  a  defence  which  asserted  plant  and  the  dishonest 
framing of the defendants by the investigators, this was plainly of great importance.  
The  non-disclosure  was  characterised  by  deliberate  failure  on  the  part  of  the 
investigators.  The case reached the Court of Appeal after the trial judge at the re-trial 
had stayed the proceedings for abuse of process, and thus it was that this court had to 
resolve  the  law  as  to  when  an  appeal  may  be  mounted  notwithstanding  a  plea  of 
guilty.  But, having done so, this court went on to hold that the re-trial ought not to 
have been stayed at all; the remedy for the non-disclosure was a fair re-trial with all 
exposed.    For  this  reason,  the  appeals  against  conviction  were  dismissed.  It  was 
otherwise in Early because there the non-disclosure concealed entrapment, which is a 
ground for a stay.   

As will be seen, we are not satisfied that Dr Black’s evidence at the trial justifies the 
description of perjury.  But even if at the single point of explaining one of the changes 
from original to amendment statement it did so, that is not a ground for staying the 
proceedings.    The  references  in  Early  to  the  significance  of  perjury  were  to  false 
evidence given in PII or voire dire proceedings when the issue of entrapment fell to be 
decided by the judge; there the perjury concealed grounds for a stay.

33. 

Accordingly,  we  do  not  agree  that  if  the  FEL  documents  had  been  exposed  at  or 
before trial the proceedings would have been brought to an end against this applicant, 
or, for that matter, against any of the others; indeed it is clear that they would not.   
Whether this applicant would have been acquitted is a matter of complete speculation.  
Despite  his  abandonment  of  his  own  device,  he  had  no  doubt  a  formidable  case  to 
meet, but no one can say.  Similarly, he might or might not have been acquitted at the 
re-trial had he fought it, but he did not.  These speculations have nothing to do with 
whether his plea of guilty amounted to an unambiguous and voluntary confession. 

It is entirely clear that it did.  Of course a defendant who is confronted by a powerful 
case may have difficult decisions to make whether to admit the offence or not. He will 
of course be advised that if he does plead guilty that fact will be reflected in sentence, 
but that general proposition of sentencing law does not alter his freedom of choice in 
the absence of an improper direct inducement from the judge, such as there was in R v 
Inns (1974) 60 Cr App R 231.  He will always have it made clear to him that a plea of 
guilty, should he choose to tender it, amounts to a confession.  Only he knows the true 
facts, which usually govern whether he is guilty or not and did so here.  If he is guilty, 
the fact that the choice between admitting the truth and nevertheless denying it may 
be a difficult one does not alter the effect of choosing to admit it.  We do not begin to 
agree that Asiedu had no real choice but to plead guilty.  He had a completely free 
choice.    Nor  do  we  agree  with  the  further  submission  made  on  his  behalf  that  the 
conviction of the others in some way altered the climate against him.  That would be 
irrelevant to his freedom of choice, but as a matter of fact the disagreement of the first 
jury in his case, when he had distanced himself from the hoax defence advanced by 
those whom it convicted, might if anything have been taken as some encouragement.   

Because it is of cardinal importance that a defendant makes up his own mind whether 
to confess by way of plea of guilty or not, and because only he knows the true facts, it 
is not open to him to assert that he was led to plead guilty by mistaken overstatement 
of  the  evidence  against  him.    As  Sir  Igor  Judge  P  observed  in  R  v  Hakala  [2002] 
EWCA  Crim  730  at  paragraph  [81],  the  trial  process  is  not  a  tactical  game.  A 
defendant  knows  the  true  facts;    he  ought not  to  admit  to  facts  which  are  not  true, 
whatever the evidence against him, and this will always be the advice he is given.  If 
he  does  admit  them,  the  evidence  that  they  are  true  then  comes  from  himself, 
whatever may be the other evidence advanced by the Crown.   

In the present case, moreover, it is in any event impossible to see that the admissions 
which  this  applicant  made  can  to  any  material  extent  have  been  influenced  by  the 
evidence of Dr Black at all, still less by those parts of it which had received adverse 
comment within the FEL.  By the time of the trial it was common ground that the 
devices were made of flour and hydrogen peroxide.  It was the positive assertion of 
those  who  admitted  that  they  had  made  them  that  those  ingredients  were  mixed  in 
proportions of about 1 to 2.  It was common ground amongst all the defendants that 
the hydrogen peroxide had been cooked at Curtis House to a concentration of about 
70%.  The only remaining issue to which the scientific evidence of Dr Black had any 
relevance was whether it might be true that, after first being concentrated to 70%, the 
hydrogen peroxide had been watered down to about 35%, so as to make the devices 
into hoaxes.   

34. 

But this was not Asiedu’s case.  His positive case at trial was that he had been led to 
believe, at least on the night before the devices were deployed, that they were real and
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

intended to be used in suicide attacks.  He ridiculed the hoax defence, joining with the 
prosecution in doing so.  The issue in his case was whether he had ever taken part in 
making  the  devices  with  the  intention  to  endanger  life.    As  counsel’s  very  full 
skeleton argument on his behalf rightly asserts, the central issue in his case was his 
own state of mind – his intention.   In due course, the admissions which he made upon 
his plea of guilty, carefully reduced to writing, owed nothing whatever to the evidence 
of Dr Black.  The evidence that he had been the procurer of the hydrogen peroxide, in 
enormous quantities, owed nothing to Dr Black.  The evidence that he had lied to the 
suppliers to obtain it likewise had nothing to do with Dr Black.  Dr Black’s evidence 
could  offer  no  assistance  on  the  intention with  which  Asiedu  did  those  things.    He 
alone knew the truth of that, and what he admitted was that he had himself had the 
intention  to  make  real  bombs  from  March.  That  was  contrary  to  the  positive  case 
which  he  had  sworn  at  the  trial  was  true,  namely  that  he  had  bought  the  hydrogen 
peroxide  in  all  innocence,  believing  it  to  be  for  decorating  or  for  cosmetic 
manufacture.  It was thus, and very clearly, an unambiguous admission.    

35. 

It follows that Asiedu’s plea of guilty unequivocally establishes his guilt.  There is 
nothing arguably unsafe about his conviction, whatever may be the true analysis of Dr 
Black’s evidence.  The failure of disclosure has for these reasons no impact on the 
safety of his conviction.  

The impact of the failure of disclosure on the scientific evidence and the trial 

36. 

That  is  sufficient  to  dispose  of  this  application,  which  must  be  refused.    Since, 
however, we have been addressed at some length on the impact both of Dr Black’s 
evidence and the failure to disclose the FEL documents criticising some parts of it, we 
ought to deal with those two matters so far as the material permits us properly to do 
so.  In doing so, we emphasise that we have not embarked upon any determination of 
any  scientific  dispute.  We  were  provided  with  further  reports  or  statements  both 
supporting  Dr  Black  and  differing  from  him,  but  have  not  examined  them  in  any 
detail  and  have  not  heard  evidence  from  any  of  the  scientists.    Given  the  plea  of 
guilty, that was unnecessary and inappropriate when dealing with this application for 
leave.  What  can,  however,  be  done,  and  is  appropriate,  is  to  identify  the  extent  to 
which there was, by the time of the trial, any remaining scientific issue, and how far 
any  issue  which  remained  might  be  affected  by  the  non-disclosure  of  the  FEL 
criticisms of Dr Black’s initial statement. 

37. 

The  concerns  expressed  by  the  FEL  authors  of  the  two  principal  documents  were 
these. 

i) 

ii) 

Conclusion 7.1 was overstated and unjustified because isotopic analysis, being 
of the atoms of elements (here oxygen and carbon) can tell one the elements 
but does not identify the compounds in which they are present.  

Conclusion 7.2 (and an earlier statement at 6.2.6 that the scene residues were 
mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and chapatti flour) were overstated because all 
wheat  flours,  including  FUDCO  chapatti  flour,  had  broadly  similar  isotopic 
values for carbon and the isotopic readings were not specific to chapatti flour. 

iii) 

A  statement  at  6.1.10  that  oxygen  isotopic  readings  in  the  scene  residues 
indicated  that  additional  components  “rich  in  oxygen  (e.g.  hydrogen
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

peroxide)” had been added to the flour was overstated because other additions 
could have supplied the oxygen – including water. 

iv) 

Paragraph 6.2.7 stated  

  “The  difference  in  the  oxygen  isotope  ratios  between  the 
 
starting  flour  and  the  scene  residues  is  related  to  the 
  proportion  of  hydrogen  peroxide  added  to  the  material 
  during the preparation of the mixture.  This can be quantified 
through  use  of  a  weighed  isotope  mixing  curve  …figure 
 
  A7.2…  This  shows 
the  proportions  of  unevaporated 
  hydrogen  peroxide  in  the  mixture  is  between  82-87%, 
  however note results in section 6.4 (evidence of evaporation 
  of hydrogen peroxide).” 

Firstly, this was said to contain the assumption without proof, also reported at 
7.1,  as  to  what  the  two  components  in  the  mixture  were  (for  which  see  (i) 
above).  Secondly, the quantification was said to be wrongly derived from the 
mixing curve, which showed, it was said, inadvertent transposition of the flour 
and peroxide percentages.  

v) 

Paragraph 6.4.1 stated:   

  “The  carbon  and  oxygen  isotope  data  from….the  scene 
residues shows that the hydrogen peroxide was concentrated 
 
in order to make the samples.  The isotopic composition of 
 
 
the  samples  can  only  be  achieved  by  concentrating  the 
  hydrogen peroxide…” 

 

Readings from Dr Black’s own experimental cooking of peroxide were then 
given  in  6.4.2,  from  which  a  peroxide  concentration  in  the  samples  of 
approximately 54-72% was deduced.  Firstly, this was said to be unsupported 
by evidence of concentration in the scene residues, which might have achieved 
their isotopic profiles by other means, including the mixing of water with the 
flour.    Secondly,  there  was  said  to  be  an  inconsistency  between  the  second 
sentence  and  6.2.7  above.    Thirdly,  there  was  said  to  have  been  no 
consideration  given  to  the  possible  decomposition  of  the  peroxide  during 
cooking, which could alter the isotopic ratios (“fractionation”). Generally, it 
was said that isotopic ratio measurements do not show conclusive evidence of 
the concentration of the peroxide.   

vi) 

Paragraph  6.5.2  recorded  that  the  scene  residues  recovered  shared  the  same 
isotopic  profiles,  save  that  those  which  were  moist  when  recovered  differed 
slightly  (but  not  enough  to  suggest  different  origins)  as  a  result  of 
fractionation.  This conclusion was said to be “incongruous”, it seems because 
dry and moist samples could not both contain 68-74% peroxide. 

Point (i): conclusion 7.1 

38. 

It  is  easy  to  see  the  force  of  this  criticism,  which  is  in  fact  apparent  from  the 
description  of  isotopic  study  provided  by  Dr  Black  himself  in  the  same  report  at
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R -v- Asiedu 

Appendix  A1  and  A1.1.      Some  elements,  including  carbon  and  oxygen,  have  a 
mixture of atoms, most of them with the usual number of neutrons and a few with a 
slightly  larger  number,  giving  a  raised  atomic  weight.    Isotopic  analysis  involves 
measuring the ratio of the heavier atoms to the normal ones.  Thus it seems clearly 
correct  that  by  itself  this  process  detects  the  characteristics  of  this  particular 
manifestation of the element concerned, in whatever compound it is contained, but it 
does not follow without more that this necessarily identifies the compound.  Whether 
if there were sufficient control samples of different compounds this would or would 
not be possible is not discussed in the materials we have seen.  Conclusion 7.1, insofar 
as  it  gave  the  impression  that  isotopic  analysis  by  itself  had  identified,  or  could 
identify, the compounds as flour and peroxide, was at least potentially misleading.  At 
first sight, and without hearing scientific evidence, we provisionally conclude that it 
ought not to have been written in that form.  Nor was this paragraph amended in Dr 
Black’s Amendment Report.  

39. 

7.1, however, is only the summary conclusion.  The rest of the report shows the full 
position.  At 6.1.1 it shows that flour was identified not by isotope analysis but by X 
ray diffraction.  At 6.1.4 it shows that X ray diffraction also detected the presence of 
sodium stannate, which is used as a stabiliser in one of the two brands of hydrogen 
peroxide bought by Asiedu and of which empty bottles were found at Curtis House.  

40.  More  importantly,  however,  there  was  at  the  trial  no  issue  at  all  about  the  two 
components of the devices.  They were admitted by those who made them to be flour 
and hydrogen peroxide.  Although Asiedu’s defence differed from that of the others 
when it came to the suggested watering down of the peroxide and the construction of 
hoax  devices,  there  was  no  possible  reason  to  doubt  the  two  components.    To  the 
extent that there was an overstatement in conclusion 7.1 it was irrelevant to the case.  
Its  only  possible  materiality  might  have  been  if  it  were  thought  to  bear  on  the 
scientific  credentials  of  Dr  Black  (as  distinct  from  his  familiarity  with  the  way  to 
frame  reports  for  forensic  purposes).    It  must  have  been  apparent  to  any  scientist 
reading his report.  The point was not even touched upon in cross-examination. 

Point (ii): conclusion 7.2 & para 6.2.6 

The point made in the FEL documents was that all wheat flours, of which FUDCO 
chapatti flour was one, were examples of flour made from C3 plants, for which the 
average  ratio  for  carbon  13  atoms  is  -27  per  mill.  That,  it  was  said,  called  into 
question the “uniqueness” of FUDCO flour.   

The  average  ratio  figure  of  -27  was  derived  from  Dr  Black’s  own  report,  where  it 
appears  at  Appendix  A3  and  was  fully  explained.    He  had  at  no  point  used  any 
expression such as “uniqueness”, which was the critics’ word.  Rather he had said that 
his  analysis  showed  that  all  wheat  flours  clustered  together  with  broadly  similar 
ratios, but that there were sufficient differences between FUDCO and ordinary wheat 
flour to differentiate them.  It is not obvious what was suspect about that. 

By  way  of  defence  statement  in  advance  of  the  trial,  one  or  more  of  the  other 
defendants  advanced  the  positive  case  that  the  devices  had  been  made  with 
Sainsbury’s flour rather than with FUDCO flour.  When Dr Black came to make his 
amendment  statement  in  December  2006,  he  also  made  an  addendum  statement 
detailing  further  work,  part  of  which  addressed  this  assertion.    The  addendum 

41. 

42. 

43.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R -v- Asiedu 

statement set out trace element analysis which distinguished clearly between FUDCO 
flour  and  Sainsbury’s  flour.      A  table  at  A6.1  clearly  showed  marked  differences 
between the two in strontium, sodium, calcium, iron and copper and table A6.2 and 
slide  32  supported  the  stated  conclusion  (at  6.2.1)  that  trace  element  and  isotopic 
analysis  both  showed  that  the  two  flours  were  “different  to  a  degree  well  outside 
analytical uncertainty”.   Meanwhile, the amendment statement, which said that it was 
devoted  to  correcting  errors,  drew  attention  to  the  original  conclusion  7.2  and 
corrected it to:   

“7.2    Isotopic  and  trace  element  analysis  of  all  the  scene 
residues and commercially available flour types shows the flour 
used  in  the  devices  was  similar  to  control  sample  GL/12 
labelled  chapatti  flour  and  the  control  FUDCO  chapatti  flour 
GDA 353”   (emphasis added) 

44. 

It is very difficult to see how it made any difference to the issue of hoax construction 
which flour it was.  The suggestion made in argument before us was that the type of 
flour went, first, to Dr Black’s scientific credibility as an expert and, second, to the 
credibility of Asiedu’s narrative account that an experimental mix had been made at 
Curtis House but the main mixing had been done at Dalgarno Gardens. As to the first, 
the  point  might  go  to  Dr  Black’s  occasionally  casual  writing  of  reports,  but  if  the 
addendum material was accurate his scientific credibility would scarcely be affected.   
The  second  suggestion  is  far-fetched.    True  it  is  that  Asiedu  gave  a  circumstantial 
account of events at Dalgarno Gardens on the morning of the day when the devices 
were deployed, and true it is that he narrated the mixing of the components.  But the 
identity  of  the  flour  variety  did  not  point  to  either  Curtis  House  or  to  Dalgarno 
Gardens.  Wherever the mixing was done, it could have been either type of flour.  

45. 

The reality is that it simply did not matter which type of flour it was. Indeed, whilst 
counsel for Mohammed dutifully put to Dr Black that it might have been Sainsbury’s 
flour,  suggesting  that  the  difference  between  dry  and  moist  scene  residue  samples 
might  muddy  the  picture,  he  shied  away  from  the  trace  element  analysis  and 
understandably made little of the cross examination.  

Point (iii):  paragraph 6.1.10 

46. 

This point appears to add little.  Dr Black’s original paragraph 6.1.10 said no more 
than  that  the  scene  residues  contained  something  more  than  just  flour,  which  was 
unarguably correct, that the extra something contained a lot of oxygen, which no one 
doubted, and that it could be hydrogen peroxide – “e.g. hydrogen peroxide”.  In this 
instance there does not seem to be any overstatement of the conclusion.  

Point (iv):  paragraph 6.2.7 

47.  When Dr Black met other scientists including his critics on 13 November 2006, a note 
was made after the discussion.  There is no sign that it was sent to him for approval, 
and in places it is not easy to be sure to whom comments ought to be attributed.  But 
at least on its face it suggests that Dr Black was asked about the figures of 82-87% for 
the  proportion  of  unevaporated  peroxide  in  the  mix  and  agreed  that  the  figures  for 
peroxide and flour had been inadvertently transposed.  It also suggests that he went 
away to think about it.  The next event was the telephone conversation with counsel
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R -v- Asiedu 

on 22 November, when, apparently without the original FEL documents before them, 
they asked if any mistake went to the mix proportion, or to the concentration figure 
for the hydrogen peroxide, or to both.  Dr Black told them that the mix proportion 
might be “slightly different” and that he wanted to run more tests.  He also told them 
that  there  were  “more  ingredients”  which  were  better  at  showing  mix  and 
concentration; that was clearly a reference to trace element work.  It was left that he 
would write two further statements, one of correction and one dealing with additional 
work.  

The amendment statement, when made a little later, drew attention to paragraph 6.2.7. 
as  a  place  where  a  mistake  had  been  made,  and  removed  from  it  the  last  sentence 
containing  the  figures  of  82-87%.    It  also  substituted  the  word  “illustrated”  for 
“quantified”.  A fresh diagram of the mixing curve referred to was provided.  This 
differed, however, only marginally from the first one.  There were some modifications 
to the labelling.  It left out percentage figures which had previously appeared along 
the  curve,  and  which  may  or  may  not  have  been  the  source  of  inadvertent 
transposition if it had occurred.  But the plotted positions were the same, for flour and 
peroxide samples, and for scene residues, and also for different mixture proportions.  
What the amendment statement did not, however, say, was that there had been any 
previous inadvertent transposition of the two components, flour and peroxide.  Nor 
did it say that the error had been drawn to the author’s attention, together with other 
criticisms, by reputable scientists in the field.  

This correction in the report being apparent, Dr Black was cross-examined about the 
disappearance of the figures of 82-87% flour as the mix.  Perhaps understandably, the 
questions  assumed  a  connection  between  these  figures  and  the  fact  that  he  had 
conducted a second set of peroxide cooking/concentration experiments.  It is by no 
means clear that the two had any connection;  the concentration experiments no doubt 
yielded plots on the mixing curve, but any inadvertent transposition/misreading of the 
end points of that curve seems to have been independent of them.  What Dr Black told 
the  court  was  (i)  a  second  concentration  experiment  was  his  own  idea  because  the 
speed of heating had been very rapid the first time, it seems in part because of the 
apparatus  used,  and  (ii)  the  substituted  mixing  curve  in  his  addendum  report  used 
concentrated  peroxide  at  the  relevant  end  rather  than  unevaporated  peroxide  as  the 
first (from which he said he had derived these figures) had done.  What he did not say 
was that there had been any transposition of figures.  We take the view, at least in the 
absence of any further explanation, that he ought to have done.  It does not, however, 
follow  that  Mr  Kamlish’s  characterisation  of  this  evidence  as  perjured  is  justified.  
Rather, it would appear to be a failure to appreciate the extent of an expert witness’ 
duty to the court.  Given the likely suggestion that the chemical qualities and isotopic 
characteristics  of  the  peroxide  might  be  altered  in  the  course  of  cooking 
(“fractionation”), it is understandable enough why the experiment was repeated at a 
much  slower  speed.  The  speed  of  cooking  and  possible  effect  on  composition  had 
been discussed at the meeting of 13 November; once again we make the assumption 
in the applicant’s favour that Dr Black can properly be criticised for not referring to 
this  in  his  addendum  report,  and  any  failure  is  similarly  of  the  expert’s  duty  of 
frankness. Fractionation was very fully explored before and at trial.  It was addressed 
by Professor Michels for the defence and was the principal point of challenge to Dr 
Black’s evidence. Thus the failure to disclose the initial references to it in the FEL 
documents does not appear to have occasioned damage to any defendant on this point

(and  see  point  (v)  below).    The  evidence  that  the  first  mixing  curve  had  relied  on 
unevaporated peroxide as one terminus seems consistent with what paragraph 6.2.7 
said, although why it was ever thought that unevaporated material was the best marker 
point is less than clear.  

50.  Whatever may be the correct analysis of paragraph 6.2.7, the mixing curves and any 
inadvertent transposition, the 82-87% figures went to the mix of ingredients not to the 
level  of  concentration  of  peroxide,  which  was  the  only  significant  live  issue  in  the 
trial to which Dr Black’s evidence was relevant.  These figures were removed by him 
from his report well before the trial and attention was drawn to their removal.  The 
mix was not significantly in doubt at the trial, for those who made the devices made a 
positive case that it was peroxide to flour at 2:1.  Dr Black’s evidence on this point 
was in no sense critical to the Crown case.   

Point (v):  concentration of hydrogen peroxide 

The concentration of peroxide, as mixed with the flour, was an issue central to the 
hoax  defence  of  the  defendants  other  than  Asiedu.    The  issue  was  not,  however, 
whether  the  peroxide  had  been  cooked  to  70%.    That  was  clearly  established  by 
documents and bottle labels left behind at Curtis House, and was expressly common 
ground at the trial. The issue was whether there had subsequently been a re-dilution 
by adding to the concentrated peroxide the same volume of tap water, thus reducing 
the concentration from 70% to 35%, or thereabouts.  The case of the other defendants, 
given in evidence by Ibrahim, was that only 12 of the bottles of 70% concentrate had 
been used, leaving lots more of it unused and thrown away after the event.  Dr Black’s 
evidence  went  to  this  contention  directly  and  in  two  ways.    First  his  original  and 
addendum  reports  derived  a  concentration  in  the  devices  of  about  54-72%,  from 
isotopic and to an extent from trace element work.  Secondly, when the re-dilution 
assertion  was  raised,  late,  in  the  course  of  the  trial,  it  was  he  who  was  asked  to 
consider it.  His evidence was that the trace element and isotopic evidence was not 
consistent  with  such  re-dilution  with  London  tap  water,  for  which  he  had  used 
published chemical data.  The scale of the difference between what was found and 
what  would  have  been  involved  if  tap  water  had  been  used  as  alleged  by  the 
defendants was very large.  

The matters raised by the FEL documents (point (v) above) necessarily went to the 
first of these two areas of evidence, since re-dilution had not then been raised by the 
defendants.  Moreover, they, or the other points discussed above, might be relevant to 
Dr Black’s scientific standing and thus to the reliability of his later conclusions about 
re-dilution.  However, his conclusions that re-dilution had not occurred appear to have 
been fully supported by the trace element analysis, never mind any isotopic analysis.  
Chiefly,  this  established  that  tin,  which  originated  from  one  of  the  two  brands  of 
peroxide  bought  by  the  defendants,  was  present  in  the  final  mixtures  in  quantities 
which were consistent with the total peroxide bought and used and not consistent with 
re-dilution and the throwing away of much of the concentrate. Nor (although this was 
not  the  defence  case)  could  all  the  re-diluted  concentrate  have  been  used,  because 
there would then be too much volume for the devices. On the face of it this evidence, 
combined  as  it  was  with  the  absurdity  of  first  taking  a  great  deal  of  trouble  to 
concentrate the peroxide only to re-dilute it, with the compellingly late appearance of 
any suggestion of re-dilution, and with the considerable body of other evidence that

R -v- Asiedu 

what was intended were real bombs, fully supported Asiedu’s contention at the trial 
that the hoax assertion was false.  

53. 

In  any  event,  the  re-dilution  and  hoax  assertions  formed  no  part  of  Asiedu’s  case 
either at trial or when he pleaded guilty at his re-trial. He positively disclaimed them 
at trial.  When he pleaded guilty, it was his own intention that he was admitting, not 
anyone else’s. 

Point (vi):  paragraph 6.5.2 

54. 

This appears to add nothing of significance.  So far as can be seen, there was nothing 
suspect  about  the  observation  that  the  moist  and  dry  residue  scene  samples  both 
pointed to a peroxide concentration in the region of 54-72% and that the differences 
between them were not significant. In due course Dr Black’s evidence in answer to 
cross examination was that his conclusions were based on comparing like with like, 
viz dry with dry.  Fractionation was an issue and has been considered above.   In any 
event,  the  question  was  not  whether  54-72%  was  less  than  perfectly  accurate,  but 
whether  it  was  double  the  true  concentration,  and  that  depended  on  whether  re-
dilution was a live possibility or not (see above).  

Conclusions relating to the scientific evidence 

55.  We  have  not,  as  explained,  embarked  on  any  re-hearing  of  the  scientific  evidence.  
But  nevertheless,  for  the  reasons  given,  and  making  the  assumptions  in  favour  of 
Asiedu  which  can  properly  be  made,  we  reach  the  following  conclusions.    Whilst 
there  may  well  be  criticisms  which  can  properly  be  made  of  Dr  Black  in  the 
presentation of a report for forensic purposes, and in the giving of expert evidence, the 
matters raised in the FEL documents do not appear to undermine his conclusions on 
the  topics  on  which  there  was  an  issue  at  the  trial.  In  any  event,  the  failure  of 
disclosure  had  no  impact  on  Asiedu’s  case,  nor  can  it  have  affected  the  voluntary 
nature of his confession by way of plea of guilty.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    HER HONOUR: 
     
      
       
      The trial proceedings 
       
      
    1 On 12 September 2007, Ms Melayna Suzette Roberts appeared before me for trial. On 1 June 2007, with the consent of the Crown, the trial was set down without a jury pursuant to the provisions of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. When arraigned Ms Roberts entered a plea of not guilty to the murder of Damon Mark Roberts at Gosford on 21 August 2006 on the grounds of mental illness. Damon Roberts was the biological child of Ms Roberts and her estranged husband Mr Rodney Roberts. He was five years of age at the time of his death. The cause of death was certified to be the combined effects of drowning and asphyxia. 
     
      
    2 By her own admission, made formally pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995, Ms Roberts acknowledges that her son died on 21 August 2006, that his death was the result of her unlawful act and that her acts were accompanied with an intention to kill. Having regard to the evidence tendered before me I am satisfied that the relevant unlawful act was constituted by Ms Roberts holding her son under water in the bath at the home of her estranged husband and, that in so doing, she intended to kill him. The sole issue in the trial before me was whether Ms Roberts should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 or convicted of his manslaughter on the basis that her capacity was substantially impaired in accordance with s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900.3 No oral evidence was called in the proceedings by either the Crown or the accused. By consent and without objection their respective cases were the subject of documentary tender. 
     
      
    4 Given the nature of the proceedings the critical documents were the reports of the forensic psychiatrists. They comprised the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 13 March 2007 and 6 September 2007, which were commissioned and tendered by the Crown, the reports of Dr Westmore, dated 29 August 2006 and 4 August 2007, which were commissioned and tendered by the accused and the reports of Dr Rosalie Wilcox, dated 15 April 2007 and 9 September 2007, also tendered by the accused. 5 The three doctors independently came to the view that at the time of Damon’s death, Ms Roberts was suffering from a recurrent major depressive illness. This is a recognised mental illness both in clinical practice and in the diagnostic literature. Each of the doctors regarded the illness from which she suffered to be of such severity as to ground either the defence of mental illness under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act by reason of it being a disease of the mind or a finding of substantial impairment on the basis of it being an abnormality of mind for the purposes of s 23A of the Crimes Act. None of the doctors were prepared to be definitive, or even to speak in terms of probability, in favouring one finding over the other. I am however assisted by Dr Westmore’s views to the effect that from a psychiatric perspective the difference between the psychiatric defence under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and a finding of substantial impairment under the Crimes Act is reflected in the degree of severity of the illness, together with the way in which the illness impacted on the accused’s behaviour, or was otherwise affecting the accused in the particular circumstances in which the crime was committed. That approach necessarily requires a careful analysis of the accused’s reported thoughts, feelings and impressions leading up to the commission of the offence which may, by definition, be either reliable or unreliable, together with an analysis of the objective or other forensic evidence that may operate either to corroborate or contradict the accused’s account. 6 Each of the three reporting doctors interviewed Ms Roberts. Dr Westmore spoke with her at length on 26 August 2006 at Mulawa prison. In January 2007 she was released to bail. Thereafter she was under Dr Wilcox’s care at the Sydney Private Clinic, a private psychiatric hospital where Ms Roberts was receiving treatment. Throughout her admission, until her discharge in April 2007, Dr Wilcox saw her twice a week. In February 2007, Dr Neilssen attended on her at the Sydney Private Clinic for the purposes of reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Each of the doctors were provided with various materials extracted from the prosecution brief of evidence in order to prepare their reports, although I note that since Dr Westmore saw her five days after Damon’s death he had access only to the police facts sheet and the statement of Mr Rodney Roberts. Dr Westmore was also provided with a letter from Dr Charters, Ms Roberts’ general practitioner, who detailed his various treatments for her recurrent depression in 2003 and 2004. Dr Nielssen was also provided with documents relating to Ms Roberts’ transfer from prison to hospital pursuant to s 97 of the Mental Health Act 1990, and with various other medical records relating to her treatment for mental illness in the past. While these documents were not the subject of a separate tender, they are referred to by Dr Nielssen and are of some relevance in revealing a history of depression from which Ms Roberts has suffered for some years.  
     
      
    7 After considering the materials tendered before me at trial, I expressed the tentative view, particularly having regard to the unanimity of opinions expressed by doctors Westmore, Nielssen and Wilcox, that the special verdict of not guilty to murder as provided for under s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act was open. The Crown did not seek to persuade me that I should come to any other verdict.  
     
      
       
      The verdict 
       
      
    8 Accordingly, I was satisfied that on the day of her son’s death and by reason of mental illness, Ms Roberts’ capacity to think rationally was temporarily suspended, depriving her of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of her behaviour. Her defective reasoning enabled her to form a belief that to achieve release from the pain and grief she was experiencing it was a reasonable course of action for her to take her own life and, since she could not consider her son living without her, that it was also right that she take his life as well. I am also satisfied that her mental illness compromised her capacity to see her son as a person in his own right. 
     
      
    9 On 12 September 2007, the day of her acquittal and without dissent from the Crown, Ms Roberts was released pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act subject to various conditions that were agreed upon by the Crown and Ms Roberts’ legal representatives. I ordered that the conditions apply strictly until further order or variation by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
     
      
    10 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a quasi-judicial specialist body currently established under the Mental Health Act 1990. I note that this Act will soon be replaced by the Mental Health Act 2007. The new Act does not appear to significantly affect the functions and powers of the Tribunal with respect to the conduct of hearings in which the Tribunal is empowered to review cases of patients who have been found not guilty of a criminal offence by reason of mental illness. The Tribunal is charged with the statutory task of seeking to achieve a balance between several sets of often competing rights such as, the individual’s right to liberty, safety and freedom from unnecessary intervention, the individual’s right to treatment, protection and care, and the interests and rights of the community to safety and protection. In ordering Ms Roberts’ release I expressed every confidence that Ms Roberts would continue to faithfully submit to the care and supervision of her doctors and to comply with any directions or suggestions of the Tribunal as they review her progress from time to time. I accepted then, and do so unreservedly today, that Ms Roberts poses no threat to the community, including any child, and that with the insight she has gained into her actions she poses no threat to herself. 
     
      
       
      The reasons for the verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness 
       
      
    11 After entering the verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, I indicated that I would publish reasons in support of that finding. The balance of this judgment constitutes those reasons. 
     
      
    12 The materials provided to the reporting doctors, materials that were separately tendered before me, included a statement from Mr Rodney Roberts. I have been greatly assisted by Mr Roberts’ detailed account of his observations of his former wife in the weeks leading up to Damon’s death including, importantly, his observations of Ms Roberts and the various telephone conversations he had with her before he arrived home at 4:45 pm on 21 August 2006 to find his son and Ms Roberts fully clothed in the bath. I am satisfied that by the time he arrived home his son was deceased but perhaps only by some minutes. After removing his son from the bath Mr Roberts placed a call to “000”. I have considered the text of that call. Mr Roberts reported that his son was neither conscious nor breathing and that he thought his former wife had drowned their son and had attempted to take her own life. At approximately 5:00 pm police and ambulance officers arrived.  
     
      
    13 The statements of the attending police were also tendered in the proceedings. They are of relevance as they set out the conversations they had with Ms Roberts upon their arrival at Mr Roberts’ home and their observations of her attitude and demeanour after she was taken into custody. 
     
      
    14 A paediatric autopsy report prepared by Dr Kevin Patrick and dated 14 December 2006 was tendered together with an expert certificate from Dr William Allender, a forensic scientist in medicinal chemistry. In so far as Dr Patrick’s report is concerned, his examination of the deceased child revealed no external injuries that were in his view inconsistent with having been sustained during the course of resuscitation. That said, given that Ms Roberts told police that she held her son under the water and that she told Mr Roberts that the child struggled to an extent, I am satisfied that despite the fact that the boy was found beneath the water cradled in his mother’s arms, that the bruising on his upper arms is consistent with Ms Roberts applying some force to his upper body to ensure that he remained submerged beneath the water. My view is reinforced by the fact that the toxicology report was negative for drugs save for very low levels of Promethazine (an anti-histamine medication), which in Dr Patrick’s view would not have been productive of any adverse effects. 
     
      
    15 Mr Roberts supplied police with a note addressed to him from Ms Roberts that had been left with other belongings of hers on the stairs leading to the bathroom in his home. Police found another note addressed to “Dearest Heavenly Father” at Ms Roberts’ residence. The content of both notes are consistent with being written before Damon was drowned and reflect Ms Roberts’ intention to take her own life and that of her child. Her intentions were repeated to both her former husband and investigating police after the death of her son. Otherwise, the content of the notes revealed little about whether she was suffering from a mental illness of such severity as to attract the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, or whether her mental capacity was compromised such as to reduce her culpability for murder to that of manslaughter. On the other hand, in my opinion her religious beliefs, enmeshed with her illness, appear to have encouraged her to think that by taking her life and that of her son they would together find a greater peace and ultimately their resurrection. It is not for me to pass any comment on her religious convictions and I do not. I am simply recording the fact that her desire for peace and a permanent refuge from her pain and grief was imposed upon her son and, that in so doing, she deprived him of his life. I am satisfied that her inability to see her son as a separate psychological and physical entity was a manifestation of her illness. This is reflected in the views of each of the psychiatrists. 
     
      
       
      Past psychiatric history  
       
      
    16 Ms Roberts was first treated by a mental health professional in 1994 after she was a victim of a sexual assault. Her next contact followed Damon’s birth in 2001, at that time in the context of marital tensions and the fact that Damon suffered illness as a small child. She reported three or four depressive episodes after that time, on each occasion in the context of her recurrently troubled marriage. She was treated with anti-depressant and/or anti-psychotic medication on these occasions. She resumed anti-depressant medication on 18 August 2006, three days before Damon’s death. I shall refer to the significance of this later in the judgment. 
     
      
    17 In October 2004, Ms Roberts’ marriage was again under considerable stress although both Mr and Ms Roberts reconciled at that time largely, it would seem, in the interests of their young son. Within six months of that reconciliation the marriage again faltered.  
     
      
    18 On 21 August 2005, after a number of failed attempts, Ms Roberts’ mother committed suicide. Whether her mother’s suicide was the catalyst for her marriage ultimately breaking down is not entirely clear. What is apparent, however, is that the death of Ms Roberts’ mother was a trigger event for the fresh onset of her daughter’s depression and other manifestations of grief. Ms Roberts saw her mother as the person who she described as her primary support person. In the weeks following her mother’s death the marriage between Mr and Ms Roberts finally ended although they continued to work together in the family business and share the parenting of Damon.  
     
      
    19 Between Easter and June 2006, Ms Roberts made concerted efforts to address her fragile emotional state and her debilitated physical state. It was during this three-month period that, with assistance, she managed to wean herself off anti-depressive medication. However, in June 2006 she suffered a fresh onset of symptoms of depression in the form of disturbed sleep, appetite loss, fluctuating energy levels and social withdrawal. She told Dr Westmore that at this time she managed to get through each day but with increasing difficulty as the anniversary of her mother’s death approached. She saw this event as a “big hurdle” she had to get over. I am satisfied that in an effort to try to cope with her grief and her emotional pain at the loss of her marriage in circumstances where she was also feeling an increasing distance from her immediate family, and with the anniversary of her mother’s death approaching, she again sought psychiatric assistance. She saw Dr Bartholemusz for grief counselling on three occasions in the six weeks before Damon’s death.  
     
      
    20 On Friday, 18 August 2006, her general practitioner prescribed the anti-depressants Lexapro and Xanax (a medication to treat anxiety and depression). Her doctor advised that it would be a matter of days to a week before the medication took effect and, for this reason, she was encouraged to contact her former husband and ask for his assistance and support by making himself available to her and their son in the days leading up to the anniversary of her mother’s death and on that particular day. She asked him to come and stay with her but in the result agreed that she and Damon would stay with Mr Roberts in accommodation he rented in Gosford.21 Mr Roberts reported that Ms Roberts was emotionally drained and in a variable mood when in his company and that on both the evening of Friday 18 August and Saturday 19 August she took sleeping tablets to assist her to sleep. He said they spoke at length about her grief and Ms Roberts “being a lost soul”.  
     
      
    22 On Monday, 21 August, the first anniversary of the death of Ms Roberts’ mother, Mr Roberts understood that she was due to attend the cemetery with her father and sisters during the morning. He had agreed to take a half-day off to be with her to support her upon her return from the cemetery. Ms Roberts’ father participated in a lengthy recorded interview on 29 August 2006 where he detailed, amongst other matters, his observations of his daughter during the family gathering at the cemetery. He said that his daughter said that she felt very drained and flat. On the other hand, he said there was nothing in her demeanour or behaviour that gave any indication that she was considering taking her own life or her son’s life. He did say, however, that she refused the invitation to join with her family for lunch preferring, she said, to go home and await the arrival of her former husband. When Dr Westmore asked her whether she was upset at the cemetery, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a different way to now. I was just numb. The last 12 months have been numb and surreal. I have gotten through day to day stuff with Damon, I haven’t taken on extra stuff. Every day was hard. It has just been survival at the end of each day.” 
        
       
       
      She told Dr Wilcox that upon leaving her father and sister after praying at her mother’s grave she went back to her house feeling “sad, heavy, overwhelmed”.  
       
      
    23 Mr Roberts spoke to Ms Roberts just before 3:00 pm to inform her that he was waiting on an email before he could leave his place of work and meet her at his home. She told him that she was at the Gosford waterfront with Damon, kicking the soccer ball. When referring to the 3:00 pm telephone call, Mr Roberts described her as sounding flat, discouraged and generally in a depressed state. Ms Roberts informed Dr Wilcox that as she was leaving the waterfront she remembered thinking that she and Damon would have a rest, and that whilst the drive home was surreal, she was able to recall a number of discrete actions on her part. In particular, she recalled going to her home to collect her son’s comfort blanket and, whilst there, writing the letter addressed to “Dear God” referred to earlier. She then said that she drove to Mr Roberts’ home and that it was upon arrival there, and she thinks sometime before she spoke to her husband by telephone at 4:00 pm, that she decided she could not go on with her life.  
     
      
    24 She said that it was during this time that she took four Xanax tablets on the basis that because she missed her morning dose and had been prescribed two tablets twice a day that she would take the morning and evening dose at the same time. She said that at this time she also gave her son 7.5 ml of a Phenergan type medication. She claimed that the medication was not given to sedate her son but because he had been bitten by an ant at the park and that he was allergic to ants. Whilst this may well be the case, I note that the medication Promethazine identified in Damon’s blood on autopsy also has the potential to produce some drowsiness. This may go some further distance in explaining how she was able to persuade her son to join her in the bath fully clothed and to effectively subdue what must have been his natural resistance to being submerged in the bath water to the point of asphyxiation. 
     
      
    25 She said that after her son was playing for a time at his father’s home they held one another and said a prayer before she told him that they were going to have a bath together. She said that while she ran the bath she resumed praying with Damon and told him that they were going to go to sleep and that they would wake up with Mimi (the child’s grandmother and her mother) who was with Jesus. She said that she stepped into the bath with the child in her arms and that they laid down together with the child cuddling into her with his blanket. She said that he turned a couple of times to get breath but eventually surrendered.26 When Mr Roberts arrived home at 4:45 pm, he was unable to find his former wife and child. He thought they must have returned to the waterfront. In the process of checking whether his son’s bike was in the laundry he noticed the note that she had left him on the stairs. The note read:  
     
      
       
        
        “Dearest Rod, Please know that GOD LOVES YOU and so do we. I just wish it was different. Love always Melayna and Damon.” 
        
       
      
    27 He then heard water splashing and thought that his former wife and his child had decided to take a bath and that the splashing water was his son’s way of letting him know where he was. He then walked into the bathroom and saw his wife lying on her left side facing the wall whilst his son was lying on his right side facing her. He said there wasn’t a lot of water on the floor, that Damon’s head was under the water and she had both her arms wrapped around him. When he pulled his deceased child from the bath he noticed that Ms Roberts’ face was red and that she was sobbing. 
     
      
    28 She reported to Dr Wilcox that if her husband had not arrived she would have taken her own life. She also acknowledged that it would have been difficult for her to drown herself in the bath and that she had no other means at hand to effect her suicide. She was also unable to explain why she had taken her medication if it was her intention to suicide. 
     
      
    29 In this connection Dr Allender was firmly of the view that the dose of 4 mg of Xanax, a short-acting anti-depressant medication, was not excessive notwithstanding the fact that she had taken in effect a double dose. In Dr Wilcox’s view, the fact that she took her medication at all at this time is a further indication of the extent of her disassociation given that very soon after taking the drugs she drowned her son and had the expressed intention of then taking her own life.30 The child was removed from Mr Roberts’ home by ambulance officers and Ms Roberts was taken into custody. Whilst in police custody Constable Joanne Plummer spoke with Ms Roberts at about 7:00 pm. She observed her to be rational and articulate in her conversation although softly spoken and subdued. She was asked how she was feeling and said words to the following effect:  
     
      
       
        
        “It wasn’t meant to be like this. I was meant to go too. I couldn’t bear knowing he would live his life without a mother. I know what its like, it’s a year today my mother passed away. Children shouldn’t have to live without their mothers, its too sad… I went to visit mum today at Palmdale, it shouldn’t be like this. I was meant to go too, just off to sleep.” 
        
       
      
    31 The events leading up to the death of Damon Roberts, including Ms Roberts’ particular vulnerability to the onset of a major depressive illness, resulted in the tragic loss of a young life – the more so because it was at the hands of his mother. I have no doubt that she has felt and will continue to feel her own personal sense of responsibility for her actions and that she is deeply remorseful for the pain she has caused Damon’s father. That said, it is appropriate that I emphasise that Ms Roberts has been acquitted of any criminal responsibility for his death by reason of her mental illness.

Queen v. Kuzmack, [1955] S.C.R. 292

Date: 1955-03-07

Her Majesty The Queen Appellant;

and

Michael Kuzmack Respondent.

1955: January 28, 31, February 1; 1955: March 7.

Present: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey,
Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Murder—Defence of accident or
self-defence—No charge to jury as to manslaughter—Whether there was material to
call for charge with respect to manslaughter—Criminal Code , s. 259  (a), (b).

The respondent was convicted of the murder of a woman. He and
the deceased were alone in a house when the occurrence took place. His defence
was accident or self-defence in a struggle over a knife said by the respondent
to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart from his evidence, there was
nothing to show the particulars of what took place. There was evidence that the
respondent and the deceased had agreed upon marriage and that there had been
prior dissension between them over the mode of life led by the deceased.
Shortly before the fatal act, they were heard quarrelling.

The trial judge did not charge the jury as to manslaughter.
The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial and the Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Locke J. dissenting): that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey,
Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The circumstances were sufficient to call
for the trial judge to charge the jury with respect to manslaughter. If the
jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide was culpable, it was
necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent the respondent had
inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that he possessed the
intent required by s. 259  (a) or (b) of the Criminal
Code , the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the jury
should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): There was no material before
the jury to justify a direction that they should consider a possible verdict of
manslaughter.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta 1[1],

on a charge of murder and ordering a new trial.

[Page 293]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Tasehereau, Rand, Kellock,
Estey, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:—

The Chief Justice: The
Attorney General of Alberta appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court 2 directing
a new trial where the accused was charged with and convicted of the murder of a
woman. The substantial point is whether there was evidence sufficient to call
for an instruction to the jury that they might find manslaughter.

The deceased and the accused were alone in a house when the
occurrence took place. The defence was accident or self-defence in a struggle
over a knife said by the accused to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart
from his evidence, there is nothing to show the particulars of what took place.
Two witnesses, the occupant of the house and his wife, then a short distance
away from the house, heard a scream and saw the woman come staggering out. To
the wife she cried ""get me to a hosp …"" and then she collapsed.

There was evidence that the accused and the deceased had
agreed upon marriage and that there had been prior dissension between them over
the mode of life being led by the deceased. That morning, shortly before the
fatal act, they were heard quarrelling. At some stage a knife came into play
which pierced the woman's neck to cut the jugular vein and she died in a few
minutes from loss of blood.

These, and other circumstances unnecessary to mention, were
sufficient to call for the learned trial judge to charge the jury with respect
to manslaughter. In Mancini's case 3, Viscount Simon, after referring to the rule
laid down in Woolmington's case 4,
that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable doubt,
and consequently that if on the material before the jury, there is a reasonable
doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it, pointed out that this is a
rule of general application in all charges under criminal law. His Lordship
continued at p. 279:

Thus, when a prisoner is charged with murder and felonious
homicide is proved against him, if the jury, when considering the evidence as a
whole at the conclusion of the case, are left in reasonable doubt as to whether
the homicide proved is not manslaughter, they should return a verdict of
manslaughter.

[Page 294]

If the jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide
was culpable, it was necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent
the accused had inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that
he possessed the intent requisite under 259(a) or (b) of
the Code the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the
jury should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Locke J.
(dissenting):—My consideration of the proceedings in this matter leads me to
the same conclusion as that expressed at the trial by the learned Chief Justice
of the Trial Division and in the Appellate Division by the learned Chief
Justice of Alberta 5.

As there is to be a new trial, I make no further reference
to the evidence other than to say that, in my opinion, there was no material
before the jury which would justify a direction that they should consider a
possible verdict of manslaughter.

I would allow this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONDUTY JUDGE LISTBRERETON JMonday, 29 October 20073359/07 White City Tennis Club Ltd v John Alexander’s Clubs Pty Ltd & 2 ors 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: For many years the land and improvements known as White City at Rushcutters Bay, owned by the New South Wales Tennis Association (""Tennis NSW""), has been the home of tennis in New South Wales. The plaintiff White City Tennis Club Ltd (""the Club"") has operated a tennis club at White City, most recently under a lease for a term of 25 years from 1 October 1995 of the whole of the first floor and part of the ground floor of the building under the Northern Stand. On or about 10 January 2004, Tennis NSW granted the Club an option to purchase part of White City for $5.8 million, exercisable by 30 September 2004 and subject to development approval. In February 2004, the first defendant John Alexander's Clubs Pty Limited (""JACS"") made a proposal to the Club intended to enable the Club to continue its traditional activities while securing its future through joining with JACS in a redevelopment of White City. A revised proposal, which would have involved the Club assigning the benefit of the option to JACS, on the basis that JACS would (1) exercise the option for the benefit of a new club in which A class shares would be acquired by foundation members of the Club and B class shares by other members of the Club and members of the public, and (2) construct a new five-star tennis and health club facility, ensuring that members of the Club could continue to enjoy the benefits of the redeveloped club, was accepted by the Club on 16 June 2004. However, the conditions of the option were not satisfied, and it lapsed on 30 September 2004.  
     
      
    2 Subsequently, Tennis NSW resolved to offer White City for sale by tender. On 28 February 2005, the Club and JACS entered into a written Memorandum of Understanding relating to the proposed purchase and redevelopment of White City. The MOU recited that JACS was negotiating with a third party – since identified as the trustees of the Sydney Grammar School (“Grammar”) – with a view to entering into an agreement with the third party that would include terms whereby the third party and JACS would prepare and lodge a tender for the purchase by the third party of White City from Tennis NSW, and the third party would grant JACS, on behalf of White City Holdings Ltd (a company to be incorporated to establish and operate a new club at the redeveloped White City, the A class shares which would be available for purchase only by persons who were members of the Club), an option to purchase part of the land from the third party [Clauses 1.8, 5.2]. The parties acknowledged that it was fundamental that those members of the Club who became members of the new club – called Foundation Members – would obtain certain minimum benefits and entitlements from the implementation of the project [Clause 3.5].3 The MOU envisaged that JACS would exercise the option, if at all, not for its own benefit but on behalf of White City Holdings, and that if it did not exercise the option on behalf of White City Holdings, there would be an alternative mechanism by which the Club could acquire the land if JACS on behalf of the Club did not do so [Clause 3.7]: 
     
      
       
        
        3.7 JACS agrees that it will seek to obtain an option to purchase the Land or part of it from TNSW or the third party and in the event it obtains the option from TNSW or the third party referred to in Clause 1.8 herein or any right to purchase the Land or any part of it then: 
         
         
        3.7.1 in the event that JACS exercises the option from TNSW or the third party that it will exercise the option on behalf of the WCH, upon WCH simultaneously granting to JAWCC [a company to be incorporated and to be the principal operating company for the project] a 99 year lease of the land entering into the operating agreement referred to in Clause 6.1(e) herein; 
        
       
       
        
        3.7.2 JACS will seek to procure in favour of WCTC a further option to purchase the Land or part of it exercisable by WCTC within 90 days of expiry of the Option Period in the event that JACS is unable to or fails to exercise the option from TNSW or the third party in accordance with its terms; 
        
       
       
        
        3.7.3 in the event that JACS is unable to procure the further option referred to in Clause 3.7.2 herein and JACS has not exercised the option from TNSW or the third party 30 days prior to the expiration of the Option Period, then upon WCTC giving written notice to JACS that WCTC requires JACS to exercise the option on behalf of WCTC, that JACS will proceed to exercise the option from TNSW or the third party on behalf of WCTC. 
        
       
      
     4 Following an invitation to submit tenders, Grammar (in the agreement called SGS), the third defendant Sydney Maccabi Tennis Club Ltd (""Maccabi""), JACS and the Club (called WCTC) on 29 June 2005 entered into an agreement (""the White City Agreement"") that provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        2. The parties agree that use of the Land be allocated between the parties as set out and further detailed in this agreement and the attached plans, being briefly that: 
         
         
        a. SGS will develop and use the area north of the stormwater channel for additional playing fields and parking and will have access to that parking from the Alma Street entrance.  
         
         
        b. Maccabi will use its area south of the stormwater channel for 8 tennis courts, a club house and parking.  
         
        
        
        c. WCTC will be lessee and WCTC and JACS will use the whole of the land (other than the parking area north of the stormwater channel) to undertake (in accordance with their agreement dated 18 June 2005) until 30 June 2006 the operations currently carried on by WCTC.  
         
         
        d. After 1 July 2006, SGS will construct its new playing fields north of the stormwater channel and until 30 September 2007 WCTC and JACS will continue (in accordance with their agreement dated 18 June 2005) the operations currently carried on by WCTC on the area south of the stormwater channel.  
         
         
        e. JACS has an option at any time before 30 June 2007 to acquire from the SGS the area south of the stormwater channel, other than the area allocated to Maccabi, without affecting SGS's access to its car park north of the stormwater channel. If JACS exercises this option it will construct new sporting facilities, gymnasium and club house on that part of the land. If JACS does not exercise its option, WCTC has an option to acquire the land between 1 July and 30 September 2007, 
         
         
        f. If neither JACS nor WCTC exercises the option, the land south of the stormwater channel other than the Maccabi Land will remain under SGS's ownership. 
         
         
        3. Each party will do all things necessary and desirable to give effect to their own and each others' intentions and that each party will co-operate fully with the others with the aim of giving effect to and fully supporting those intentions. 
         
         
        Land Allocation 
          
         
         
        4. On completion of the purchase of the Land ( 
        'Settlement'),  
        subject to survey, the entitlements in respect of the Land as between the parties will be as set out in the attached plans, briefly described below, in these percentages: Maccabi 15%; Option Land 50.2%; and SGS Land 34.8%, allocated as specifically set out in this agreement.  
         
          
         
        5. The  
        'Maccabi Land' 
         comprises: 
         
         
        a. 8 synthetic grass tennis courts, with minimum size of 115ft x 54ft, plus a one metre walkway on the southern, western and northern boundaries ( 
        'Maccabi Courts' 
        ). These tennis courts will be on the south eastern portion of the Land, roughly where the 6 synthetic courts are currently and in due course including part of the land where the eastern stand is currently situated, 
         
         
        b. 30 car parking spaces for its members, and other users of the Maccabi Courts, and subject to availability, additional spaces will be made available on an agreed commercial basis. All of these spaces will be in the car park south of the storm water channel, either in the existing car park constructed south of the stormwater channel or in the new car park constructed by JACS or WCTC, 
         
         
        c. a 300m2 clubhouse including changing facilities ( 
        'Maccabi Clubhouse' 
        ), as further described in paragraphs 10 and 11 below, and 
         
         
        d. access between the car park, the Maccabi Courts and Maccabi Clubhouse, including the areas marked on the diagram in orange as 'Maccabi occupancy'.  
         
         
        6. If Maccabi wishes to do any work on the Maccabi Courts during its 2 year lease of the Maccabi Courts to WCTC, it will not start that work in the 1 January 2007. WCTC will allow Maccabi possession and access for this purpose from that date. 
         
        
       
      
    5 Despite references in the White City Agreement to an attached diagram, none was attached. However, an understanding of the layout of the land is aided by the plan attached to this judgment. 
     
      
    6 Clause 7 of the White City Agreement defined “the SGS Land” as comprising the area north of the stormwater channel, and the land (called ""the Option Land"") south of the stormwater channel other than the Maccabi land, unless JACS or the Club exercised the option, granted in Clause 8, to buy the Option Land, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        8. Subject to Settlement, SGS and Maccabi ( 
        'Grantors' 
        ) grant the following rights, referred to as the  
        'Option' 
        : 
         
         
        a. to JACS an option to acquire the Option Land for the Option Amount payable solely by JACS, exercisable by JACS giving written notice to the Grantors and paying the Option Amount at any time from completion of the purchase of the Land until 30 June 2007, but 
         
         
        b. if JACS does not exercise the option within this period, the Grantors grant WCTC an Option from 1 July to 30 September 2007, exercisable by WCTC giving written notice to the Grantors and paying the Option Amount before 30 September 2007. 
        
       
       
      
    7 It is uncontentious that the option contained in Clause 8a is an option of the type contemplated by Clause 3.7.1 of the MOU, and that contained in Clause 8b is one of the type contemplated by Clause 3.7.2 of the MOU. 8 By Clause 9, the Option Amount was $6.33 million (subject to certain adjustments), and the party that exercised the Option became ""the Option Land Owner"". By Clause 10b, if either JACS or the Club exercised the Option, and the land had not then been subdivided, the Option Land Owner would own 50.2% of the land as tenant-in-common with Grammar (34.8%) and Maccabi (15%), or if the land had been subdivided to create a separate title for the SGS Land (north of the stormwater drain), but the Maccabi Land and the Option Land (south of the stormwater drain) was still on one title, then the Option Land Owner and Maccabi would own, as tenants-in-common, 77% and 23% respectively of the combined area of the Option Land and the Maccabi Land.  
     
      
    9 Clause 10c provided:  
     
      
       
        
        c. The Option Land Owner will, subject to funding and development approval: 
         
         
         1. construct and maintain on the Option Land at its cost, a club including tennis courts and sports and recreational facilities, plus a car park for at least 300 cars, and 
         
         
         2. construct the Maccabi Clubhouse at reasonable cost, currently circa $800-$1000 per m2 (to be borne by Maccabi who will also be responsible for and bear the fit out cost), either as a separate facility or as part of the Option Land Owner's facilities, in a position convenient to the Maccabi Courts. 
        
       
      
    10 Clause 11 provided that in the event that neither JACS nor the Club exercised the option, the Maccabi Clubhouse would be located under the eastern centre court stand, or in any other location agreed between Grammar and Maccabi, but Grammar would be under no obligation to demolish the eastern stand and Maccabi would bear any cost of fit out, demolition and reconstruction. Clauses 12 and following were relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        12. Maccabi will have unfettered access to and ownership of the Maccabi Clubhouse to the fullest extent possible at law and a 99 year lease at a peppercorn rent if required by Maccabi (unless it is recognised as part of the Maccabi Land in any subdivision). Unless and until exercise of the Option, no party may begin work on the Option Land without SGS's prior written consent. 
         
         
        Maccabi Clubhouse and Courts 
         
         
        13. From expiry of the Lease of the Maccabi Courts, the Maccabi Clubhouse will be under the eastern stand unless and until demolished by the Option Land Owner and may be shared between Maccabi and the Option Land Owner.  
         
         
        14. From the date of the demolition, the Option Land Owner will grant Maccabi full use of equivalent facilities until the Maccabi Clubhouse is completed. If, within 18 months after the eastern stand is demolished Maccabi has not been provided with a permanent Maccabi Clubhouse, Maccabi will be allocated at least 300m2 of land adjoining and convenient to the Maccabi Courts for its sole use on which to build the Maccabi Clubhouse at its cost, marked on the attached plan as 'Maccabi Default Occupancy Area'. Maccabi will continue to enjoy full use of other appropriate facilities until Maccabi has managed to complete building such facilities.  
         
         
        15. Given that it is proposed that Maccabi build two of the eight courts on land including the site of the eastern stand, from expiry of the Lease for as long as the eastern stand remains and for the period reasonably required to enable Maccabi to build its two additional courts on that land, Maccabi will have use of any two additional suitable courts on the Option Land and they will form part of the Maccabi Land. 
        
       
       
        
      
    11 Clauses 16 and following relevantly provide that Grammar and Maccabi as joint owners of the land will grant the Club a lease, commencing on the date of settlement, to be documented by an amended lease, of the whole of White City from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, and of the Option Land from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2007 unless and until JACS or the Club exercises the option; if JACS or the Club exercises the option then the Lease will expire on the date of exercise in respect of the SGS Land, and on 30 September 2007 in respect of the Maccabi land; and if neither exercises the option then on 30 September 2007. By Clause 21, the Club agreed to surrender any rights which it otherwise would have had in relation to White City under its former arrangements with Tennis NSW (in the agreement called TNSW), and that from 30 September 2007 Maccabi would have full and unfettered rights in respect of the Maccabi land. Clause 22 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        22. Each of the parties will have a stand alone, independent facility on its part of the Land with the exception of the Maccabi Clubhouse which will be built on the Option Land. Each party will bear all costs of maintaining in good repair the facilities on its Land and will bear all liabilities attaching to its Land, including work required by statutory notices. 
        
       
      
    12 By Clause 27, each party as occupant of a part of the land in accordance with the agreement agreed, in respect of that part of the land it occupied, that it did so at its own risk, and released the land owner from and indemnified the land owner in respect of any liability to the occupant in relation to that part. Clause 29 and following are relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        29. SGS and Maccabi will enter into an agreement under which SGS will sell Maccabi the Maccabi Land, for a purchase price of $3.3m. Maccabi’s purchase of the Maccabi Land will complete contemporaneously with settlement ... . As a result Maccabi will own 15% of the land as tenant in common with SGS. SGS and Maccabi will, if required by either of them enter into a co-ownership deed reflecting more fully the matters referred to in this agreement.  
         
         
        ...  
         
         
        33. The parties intend to apply to subdivide the Land and will use best efforts to ensure that any application to subdivide the Land is successful and accurately reflects each party's entitlement as set out in this agreement and will collaborate with Woolahra [sic] Council in relation to the subdivision to maximize the benefit for all parties. Each party agrees to execute transfers and other documentation as required to resolve the parties' ownership of the Land in accordance with this agreement. ...  
         
         
        34. If the subdivision results in the area south of the stormwater channel being on a single title, so that the Maccabi Land and the Option Land remain on a single title, then SGS (or the Option Land Owner after exercise of the Option) and Maccabi will own the Land south of the stormwater channel as tenants in common as to 77% and 23% respectively. SGS (or the Option Land Owner if the subdivision occurs after exercise of the Option) and Maccabi will if required by either of them, enter into a co-ownership deed reflecting more fully the matters referred to in this deed. That deed will be assigned to the Option Land Owner on exercise of the Option, if it is entered into before exercise of the Option.  
         
         
        35. Until the subdivision is complete, no party may encumber any part of the Land, without approval of the other parties. Each party may lodge a caveat in respect of its interest in the Land, but must sign all documents necessary to give effect to the subdivision(s) and not rely on its caveat to affect the progress of the subdivision in any way.  
         
         
        36. If a party intends to sell its part of the Land ( 
        ‘Selling Portion’ 
        ), it must offer to sell the Selling Portion to each of the other parties subject to the terms of this Agreement (unless the Option has expired without being exercised, in which case the parties having the benefit of the Option do not have the benefit of this pre-emptive right ( 
        ‘Offeree’ 
        ) and must not sell the Selling Portion to any third person on any terms more favourable than those offered to the Offeree without first giving the Offeree 30 days in which to exercise its pre-emptive right to buy the Selling Portion on those terms. … 
         
         
        ...  
         
         
        41. This agreement binds the parties, their successors and assigns. ... 
         
         
        42. WCTC and JACS agree that their MOU dated 28 February 2005 and their agreement dated 18 June 2005 continue in accordance with their terms and each agrees to carry out its obligations under this agreement in accordance with those agreements.  
         
         
        43. To the extent of any inconsistency between this agreement and any other agreement between any of the parties, this agreement will prevail, unless specifically stated. …  
         
         
        44. The parties must ensure that any successors and assigns become parties to this agreement by appropriate documentation. 
         
        
       
        
      
    13 Grammar completed the purchase of White City from Tennis NSW on about 1 July 2005, whereupon Maccabi completed the purchase of the Maccabi Land from Grammar. Grammar and Maccabi as lessors and the Club as lessee entered into a variation of lease dated 6 April 2006 to give effect to the surrender by the Club of its rights, as contemplated by Clause 21 of the White City Agreement, and the granting of an interim lease as contemplated by Clauses 16 – 20 of the White City Agreement, the result of which was that the Club surrendered 13 years of its leasehold estate and its licence to manage and conduct tennis activities on White City.  
     
      
    14 Within one week of that surrender being formalised, JACS, on 12 April 2006, purported to terminate the MOU for alleged repudiation by the Club. The Club denies the alleged repudiation and disputes the validity of the purported termination. However, on 27 June 2007, JACS’ nominee, the second defendant Poplar Holdings Pty Limited (“Poplar”), purported to exercise the Clause 8a option under the White City Agreement and to purchase the Option Land, on its own behalf. In late June 2007, the Club commenced these proceedings, in which it denies that it repudiated the MOU and disputes that the MOU has been validly terminated; and further alleges that the exercise of the option by JACS’ nominee Poplar otherwise than on behalf of White City Holdings or the Club was in breach of fiduciary and /or contractual obligations owed by JACS to the Club, by reason of which it is said that Poplar holds the Option Land on trust for the Club. The Club seeks an order that JACS transfer the Option Land to the Club, upon the Club paying the option amount to Poplar. 15 White City has been subdivided into two lots – one comprising the SGS Land north of the stormwater drain, and the other comprising the Maccabi Land and the Option Land south of the drain. Maccabi, Poplar and Grammar are now the registered proprietors as tenants in common of the two lots in the proportions 15:50.2:34.8 respectively. The issues 
     
      
    16 The clubhouse that the Club currently occupies under the northern centre court stand is situated on the Option Land. If the Club is, as it contends, entitled in equity to the Option Land, that would include its current clubhouse under the northern stand. Poplar contends the Club's lease of the Option Land terminated on 27 June 2007 upon exercise of the option, and that since then the Club has been holding over under the lease. 17 The Club, wishing to maintain its ability to operate a tennis club at White City pending the final determination of these proceedings, negotiated with Maccabi which, by a deed of licence dated 19 September 2007, granted to the Club a licence to use certain parts of the Maccabi land – namely, the six existing Maccabi tennis courts, the interim Maccabi clubhouse under the eastern stand, and the two additional courts – for a term of six months from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008.  
     
      
    18 On 26 September 2007, Poplar served notice to quit on the Club, requiring possession of the Option Land, including the clubhouse under the northern stand, by 31 October 2007. On 19 October 2007, Poplar's solicitor, by letter to the Club’s solicitors and without prejudice to the contention that the Maccabi Licence was not an effective grant of a licence to the Club, purported to revoke the licence. 19 The Club claims an interlocutory injunction restraining JACS and Poplar (1) from interfering with its enjoyment of its rights under the Maccabi Licence, and in particular its use of the interim Maccabi clubhouse under the eastern stand and the two additional courts; and alternatively (2) from interfering with its use and occupation of its existing clubhouse under the northern stand. The basis of the final relief in aid of which the first claimed injunction is sought is the restraint of an apprehended tort, namely interference with the Club’s contractual rights under the Maccabi licence. The basis of the final relief in aid of which the alternative claimed injunction is sought is restraint of interference with the Club’s claimed beneficial proprietary entitlement to the Option Land, on which the northern stand is situated; in effect it impugns Poplar's entitlement to give the notice to quit. 20 On an application such as the present for an interlocutory injunction, the test is whether the plaintiff has established a sufficiently seriously arguable case for a final injunction as to justify the grant of interlocutory relief, having regard to the balance of convenience. The two elements of ""seriously arguable case"" and ""balance of convenience"" are interrelated, in that the stronger the apparent case for final relief, the less will be required to tip the balance of convenience in favour of the grant of an injunction, and the disparity of convenience and inconvenience resulting from the grant or withholding of an injunction will affect how strong a case is required to justify an interlocutory injunction. However, where the decisive issue is a question of law, the Court should ordinarily endeavour, where it is possible to do so, to determine the question of law, rather than only to consider whether it is sufficiently arguable. Ultimately, the decisive issues in this application are such questions, and it is possible to determine them. The contractual claim – the Maccabi Licence21 Poplar has written to Maccabi and the Club, asserting that Maccabi has no right to grant the licence, at least so far as it relates to the interim Maccabi clubhouse and the two additional courts, and has attempted to lock the Club out from the interim Maccabi clubhouse. It is not entirely clear whether Poplar objects to the licence in respect of the six existing Maccabi courts, Poplar’s submissions on the application indicate that it does so object; but a letter dated 9 October 2007 from Gayle Meredith & Associates (for JACS) to Leslie Caplan and Grunstein (for Maccabi) indicates otherwise.22 The Club contends that these acts of Poplar constitute the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations. That tort is committed when the defendant (JACS and/or Poplar) intentionally interferes with the performance by a third party (Maccabi) of a contract (the Maccabi Licence) between that third party and the plaintiff (the Club). Direct persuasion or procurement or inducement of the other contracting party by the defendant is sufficient to constitute the tort [DC Thomson & Co Ltd v Deakin [1952] Ch 646, 681 (Evershed MR), 694 (Jenkins LJ)].  
     
      
    23 There is at least a reasonable apprehension that Poplar will, if not restrained, procure – either by persuasion of Maccabi, or by itself effecting a lockout – an interference with the Club’s enjoyment of the benefits purportedly conferred on it by the Maccabi Licence. JACS and Poplar did not contend otherwise. The gravamen of their case was that there was no valid contract: JACS and Poplar contend that Maccabi, as one of several tenants in common, was not entitled to grant a licence to the Club, and alternatively that if Maccabi could grant a licence, it could be revoked by any other of the tenants in common, and has been revoked by Poplar. Accordingly, the substantial issues are: 
     
     ·  
     Was Maccabi entitled to grant the Maccabi Licence to the Club? 
      
       
      
     ·  
     If so, was Poplar entitled to revoke the Maccabi Licence? 
    24 Was Maccabi entitled to grant the Maccabi Licence to the Club? Although there is authority elsewhere that one of several tenants-in-common may grant a licence which is not revocable by the others without the consent of the grantor [Chin Lan Hong v Cheung Poh Choo [2005] 3 HKLRD 811, [2005] HKEC 1156, [35] (HKCA)] (just as one of several tenants-in-common may grant a lease [see Catanzariti v Whitehouse (1981) 55 FLR 426; U-Needa Laundry Ltd v Hill [2000] 2 NZLR 308]), for the purposes of this Court, the right of one of several tenants in common of property to grant a licence was authoritatively determined in State of New South Wales v Koumdjiev (2005) 63 NSWLR 353, holding that a tenant in common of a property, although able to transfer or lease its interest to a stranger, cannot short of such transfer or lease grant a licence to a stranger which is irrevocable by other tenants in common if that licence is of a kind which goes beyond what is reasonable or incidental to the grantor's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, enjoyment in common with the other tenants in common, and which interferes with the possession and use and enjoyment of the property by other tenants in common (per Hodgson JA at [40]; Beazley JA and Hislop J concurring). Hodgson JA continued to explain: 
     
      
       
        
        41 For example, suppose there are two tenants in common of a small house, and one of them purports to grant a licence to twenty people to live in the house. If this amounted to excluding the other from possession, it would be a trespass; but if it fell short of excluding the other person, but was substantially detrimental to the other tenant in common's use and enjoyment of the property, in my opinion such a licence could be terminated by the other tenant in common, assuming that it went beyond what was reasonable and incidental to the grantor's possession and use and enjoyment of the property. That is, in my opinion, any licence in excess of the what is reasonable and incidental to one tenant in common's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, and which prejudices the other tenant in common's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, is a licence terminable by the other tenant in common. Otherwise, in my opinion, there can be no reasonable reconciliation of the rights of both tenants in common to have possession and use and enjoyment of the property.  
         
         
        42 On that basis, the result in  
        Robson-Paul 
         is correct. If there was a licence to use the premises to the exclusion of the plaintiff, that was clearly a licence that could not be granted; but if the licence fell short of that, but was a licence to continue for an indefinite period to exercise all the rights of one tenant in common, without a transfer or lease, it would be a licence going beyond what was reasonable and incidental to the grantor's possession and use and enjoyment of the property in common with the plaintiff, and so was terminable by the plaintiff.  
         
         
        43 In my opinion, the result in  
        Annen v Rattee 
         is probably correct on the same basis. In my opinion, that case was wrong in so far as it applied to cases concerning periodic tenancies granted by joint tenants, and insofar as it suggested a licence granted by one tenant in common, it could always be terminated by another. But it was open to conclude that the licence granted in that case was so extensive as to be terminable by the other tenant in common.  
         
         
        44 In my opinion, the result in  
        Hong v Choo 
         was also correct. The tenant in common was dead, and the administrators of his estate wished to have a representative occupying the property, and they authorised the family member who had lived in the house with the other family members to stay in the house pending the sale. In my opinion, that was reasonably incidental to that tenant in common's right to possession and use and enjoyment of the property, and was in so terminable by other tenants in common.  
         
         
        45 Applying this approach to the entrance foyer of an apartment block, and subject to any by-laws of a relevant strata scheme, this would mean that, if one unit owner gives a licence to an acquaintance to enter the common property in order to visit the unit owner's unit, that licence could not be revoked by another unit owner.  
         
         
        46 On the other hand, one unit owner could not give a licence, irrevocable by another unit owner, to a person who sought entry in order to harass the other unit owner at the internal front door of the latter's unit. That licence would not be reasonable and incidental to the right of the grantor to possession and use and enjoyment of the common property. The grant of such a licence could not trump the right of the person who would be harassed and exclude the harasser, as an incident of that person's right to possession and use and enjoyment of the common property. 
         
        
       
        
      
    25 The rationale for the different position in respect of a licence and a lease is that the lease of one tenant-in-common’s share effectively substitute’s the lessee’s rights for those of the lessor, so that the burden is not increased, and the lessee has a right of possession to the exclusion of the lessor but together with the other tenants-in-common, whereas in the case of a licence the licensee’s right of occupation is not exclusive of that of the licensor and does not carry a right to possession, so that the total burden is increased, as is illustrated by the example given by Hodgson JA in Koumdjiev, in the passage cited above, at [41].26 Although the proposition was doubted by the Court of Appeal in Robson-Paul v Farrugia (1969) 20 P & CR 820, the predominant view is that one of several tenants in common can grant a licence to enter on to the property [Bull v Bull [1955] 1 QB 334, 237; Hong v Choo [2004] HKCFI 24; affirmed [2005] HKEC 1156; New South Wales v Koumdjiev]. 27 Mr Ireland QC submitted that Maccabi was not entitled to grant a licence in the particular context of the White City Agreement, because the White City agreement did not confer on the Club any rights of use or occupation of any part of White City after expiry of the lease, and provided that after the expiry of the lease only the co-owners – Poplar, Grammar and Maccabi – had rights of use and occupation. While it is correct that the White City agreement does not confer on the Club any rights of use or occupation after expiry of the lease, that is irrelevant to the Club’s contractual claim, which does not involve reliance on any rights conferred on the Club by the White City agreement. It is not correct that the White City Agreement provides that only Poplar, Grammar and Maccabi have rights of use and occupation of the land: while it makes provision for the use and occupation of the land by them, it contains no provision inconsistent with any one of them being entitled to grant licences to others in respect of those parts of the land which that co-owner is entitled to use and occupy. In the absence of provision to the contrary, a contractual right to use real property is, like any other contractual right, assignable in equity [cf Meagher Gummow & Lehane, Equity Doctrines & Remedies, 4th edition, [6-010]]. Maccabi was entitled to grant a licence to the Club, unless some provision in the White City Agreement prevented it. The White City Agreement contains no such provision; indeed it contains, in Clauses 41 and 44, affirmative indicia of assignability. Clause 36 also recognises that a party may assign its interest in White City, albeit subject to rights of pre-emption. Clause 5b contemplates that persons other than Maccabi's members may be permitted to use Maccabi’s Courts, and thus the car parking spaces. While Clause 35 provides that until subdivision is complete ""no party may encumber any part of the land without approval of the other parties"", the grant of a licence is not an encumbrance, not being a claim, lien or liability attached to property [Wallace v Love (1922) 31 CLR 156, 172 (Higgins J)]. 28 Indeed, the White City agreement necessarily contemplates that each co-owner will be entitled to permit others to enter upon and use parts of their land from time to time. Sydney Grammar School’s apparent purpose in acquiring the land was to expand its playing fields from the existing neighbouring Weigall Oval. The new fields would obviously be used not only by the trustees of the school (the co-owners), but also by pupils (who are separate legal entities from the Trustees), and by visiting teams from competing schools. Maccabi, a corporation, would permit its members (different legal entities) – and presumably their guests – to use the Maccabi facilities. And at the time the White City agreement was made, it was contemplated that if JACS exercised the option it would do so on behalf of White City Holdings, which in turn would permit its members to enjoy the facilities of a tennis club on the land. All these arrangements would involve sub-licences. 29 Accordingly, there is nothing in the White City Agreement that detracts from the prima facie position that Maccabi as one of several joint tenants can grant a licence.30 Was Poplar entitled to revoke the Maccabi Licence? The answer to this question, according to New South Wales v Koumdjiev, depends on whether the licence exceeds what is reasonable and incidental to Maccabi's possession and use and enjoyment of the property in common with Grammar and Poplar, and interferes with the possession and use and enjoyment of the property by Grammar and Poplar. If so, the licence was revocable by Poplar. 31 This requires consideration of the rights of Maccabi to the possession, use and enjoyment of White City. In this case, exceptionally, the rights of each of the tenants-in-common are regulated to a substantial extent by the White City Agreement, and must be viewed in that light. Relevantly, Maccabi's rights under the White City Agreement presently include the following:  
     
     ·  
     legal title as tenant-in-common (as to 15%) with Grammar (as to 35%) and Poplar (as to 50%) of both the lots; 
      
       
      
     ·  
      a beneficial entitlement to the Maccabi Land, corresponding to a 23% interest in the land south of the stormwater drain unless and until it is subdivided (but no beneficial entitlement in the land north of the drain). Although Maccabi, Poplar and Grammar are legal tenants in common in the specified shares, those shares are ""allocated as specifically set out in this agreement"" [Clause 4]. The agreement recognises that each party has its own ""part of the land"" [Clauses 22, 26, 27] and provides for Maccabi to acquire the Maccabi Land [Clause 29]; 
      
      
     ·  
     use and occupation of the six existing Maccabi courts; 
      
      
     ·  
     use of 30 car parking spaces, and the future Maccabi Clubhouse when erected, to be situated in part or whole on the option land [Clauses 5(b), (c), 10 (c) (ii), 11 (c), 12, 22]; 
      
      
     ·  
     use of two additional courts of its own choice on the Option Land, until it had constructed two additional Maccabi Courts in the Maccabi area; 
      
      
     ·  
     use and occupation, in common with Poplar, of the interim Maccabi Clubhouse in the eastern stand. Although at first I wondered whether Clause 12, which confers on Maccabi “unfettered access to and ownership of the Maccabi clubhouse to the fullest extent possible at law”, was of ambulatory effect so that it applied to the interim clubhouse as well as the future clubhouse, I have concluded that it is not, and operates in respect of the future clubhouse only. This conclusion is dictated by Clause 13, which provides that use of the interim clubhouse may be shared between Maccabi and JACS. I am unable to construe Clause 13 as conferring on Maccabi a discretion to share the interim clubhouse with JACS if it wishes but not otherwise; if Clause 12 applied to the interim clubhouse then there was no need to additionally confer any such discretion. The purpose of the reference to “sharing” in Clause 13 is to distinguish the rights in respect of the interim clubhouse from those in respect of the future clubhouse, and to clarify that Maccabi’s rights to the interim clubhouse were not exclusive; it was inserted for the benefit of JACS, rather than for the benefit of Maccabi. This conclusion is reinforced by Clause 14, which confers a right to “full use” – as distinct from shared use – of equivalent facilities, after demolition of the eastern stand clubhouse. Accordingly, in my opinion, the White City Agreement does not give Maccabi use to the exclusion of Poplar of the eastern stand clubhouse. 
      
    32 On behalf of Poplar it was submitted that the licence went beyond what was reasonable and incidental to Maccabi’s rights, and interfered with the rights of the other tenants in common in several respects: 
     
      
     ·  
     It was said that it encumbered parts of the land, in contravention of Clause 35 of the White City agreement. However, a lease is not an encumbrance. 
      
       
      
     ·  
     It was said that it permitted Maccabi to charge and receive a licence fee without accounting to the co-owners. While this is true, there would be no liability to account if the licence related only to parts of the land that Maccabi was entitled to use exclusively. And even if Maccabi were liable to account to its co-owners, that would not of itself show that the licence unreasonably interfered with the rights of the co-owners. 
      
       
      
     ·  
     It was said that it licensed the occupation and use of areas within the Option Land – including the Maccabi Clubhouse, the two additional courts and the thirty car spaces – for a specified term, without regard to Poplar’s obligations under the White City Agreement to commence developing the Option Land. However, what the licence permits the Club to do on the Option Land is no more than what Maccabi is itself entitled to do under the White City Agreement. The Maccabi Licence does not constrain Poplar’s ability to perform its obligations, any more than they are already constrained by Maccabi’s own rights. 
      
     ·  
     It licenses to the Club the use and occupation of the Maccabi clubhouse and two additional courts, when those areas may only be occupied and used by Poplar and Maccabi. Save for the issues concerning the clubhouse to which I shall come, this depends on the proposition that the White City Agreement limits use of those areas to the co-owners and does not permit any one of them to allow others to use them; for reasons already advanced I reject this argument. 
      
       
      
     ·  
     It licenses the use and occupation of the Maccabi Courts and car spaces, when in accordance with the White City Agreement they may only be used and occupied by Maccabi. Again, this depends on the proposition that the White City Agreement denies Maccabi the ability to license or sub-license the use of its facilities, which I have already rejected. 
      
    33 But for Clause 13, the position would have been clear. The Maccabi licence conferred on the Club rights in respect of the Maccabi Courts and the car parking spaces which Maccabi had under the White City Agreement to the exclusion of the other tenants-in-common, and it did not in those respects interfere with the possession, use and enjoyment of the property by the other tenants-in-common, having regard to the terms of the White City Agreement. The grant of access between the car parking spaces and courts was reasonably incidental to that use. Save in respect of the interim Clubhouse, the Maccabi licence does not confer on the Club any larger rights than those to which Maccabi is, in any event, exclusively entitled under the White City Agreement; and – because Maccabi is exclusively entitled to those rights, which distinguishes the case from many of those referred to by Hodgson JA in Koumdjiev – the corollary is that it does not impinge on the rights of the other tenants-in-common. 34 The difficulty arises because, on the construction of Clauses 12 and 13 which I favour, Maccabi is not entitled to use of the interim clubhouse to the exclusion of Poplar, although it is entitled to use it in common with Poplar. Use by the Club of the interim Maccabi clubhouse will result in an increase in the intensity of its use, which may reduce its amenity to the other joint tenants. If the context were that of tenants in common unregulated by agreement as to their respective rights to various parts of the land, that would be an unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of the property by Poplar: it is analogous to the example given by Hodgson JA in Koumdjiev, at [41]. 35 I do not think that the White City Agreement alters this position. While the intent of the White City Agreement was that Maccabi ultimately have a clubhouse which would be entirely under its ownership and control, it was not entitled to exclude the Option Land Owner from the interim clubhouse under the eastern stand, which was to remain a shared facility. In those circumstances, a licence to a third party which would involve user of that clubhouse by that third party as well as by Maccabi and the Option Land Owner, in a manner not associated with Maccabi’s occupation (such as use by Maccabi’s own members or guests would be), would not be reasonably incidental to Maccabi’s user, and would unreasonably interfere with the rights of the Option Land Owner, Poplar. Accordingly, such a licence would be revocable by Poplar. 
     
      
    36 It follows that in my opinion the Maccabi Licence, insofar as it confers rights on the Club in respect of the eastern stand clubhouse, was revocable by Poplar, and has been revoked. The Club does not have a sufficiently seriously arguable case for a final injunction restraining JACS and Poplar from interfering with its contractual rights under the Maccabi Licence, I respect of the eastern stand clubhouse, though it does with respect to the other aspects of the licence.The proprietary claim 
     
      
    37 That conclusion makes it necessary to consider the alternative basis on which the Club puts its case, namely that it is entitled in equity to the Option Land by reason of JACS having exercised the option for its own benefit (it being uncontroversial that Poplar is an associated company of JACS), when it was bound to do so if at all for the benefit of White City Holdings and, if not, for the Club. 38 The original proposal by JACS to the Club described what was proposed as a “Joint Venture”. However, the revised proposal did not use that terminology, and the MOU expressly provided (by Clause 7.1) that nothing in the MOU shall be taken to constitute the parties as partners or as joint venturers for any purpose whatsoever. This creates a significant obstacle to the super-imposition generally of the fiduciary obligations of joint venturers on the contractual relationship between the parties, and tends to show that they did not intend that their relationship be attended by such fiduciary obligations. 39 However, under Clause 3.7.1 of the MOU, the Club had a contractual right to insist that JACS exercise the Clause 8a option under the White City Agreement, if at all, on behalf of White City Holdings; and under Clause 3.7.2 itself to exercise the Clause 8b option if JACS did not so exercise the Clause 8a option. Clause 3.7.3 is not engaged in the events which have happened, but confirms that it was the common intention of the Club and JACS that, if JACS did not exercise the option on behalf of White City Holdings, then there was to be an opportunity for the Club to do so on its own behalf. Moreover, the other parties to the White City Agreement were on notice of the arrangements between JACS and the Club, and contracted on the basis that JACS and the Club would perform those arrangements [see Clause 42].  40 Accordingly, it was never contemplated or intended that JACS might exercise the option on its own behalf: if it did not do so on behalf of White City Holdings, the Club would have the opportunity of exercising the option, and if the Club did not do so, the option would lapse. It may be assumed that the Club and JACS are not to be regarded as joint venturers, but in respect of the exercise of the option JACS was not entitled to act on its own behalf. By reason of the MOU, it was bound to afford the Club an opportunity to exercise the option if it did not itself do so on behalf of White City Holdings, which so far as the evidence reveals has never been incorporated. 41 Although JACS asserts that it has terminated the MOU for repudiation, that is disputed by the Club, and no evidence has been adduced on this application sufficient to permit a conclusion that it was no longer reasonably arguable that there remains on foot a binding and enforceable contract in terms of the MOU. Assuming that the contract remains on foot, however, it does not follow that the Club has a beneficial interest in the Option Land. It was White City Holdings, not the Club, that was to be beneficially entitled upon exercise of the Clause 8a option, and although it was intended that White City Holdings would include certain members of the Club and preserve their enjoyment of the facilities, it was also to include other interests, and is not possible to treat the Club as entitled in place of White City Holdings under Clause 8a. This does not deny the Club’s standing to claim a remedy: it matters not for that purpose that the beneficiary was to be White City Holdings, not the Club, because the Club as a contracting party is entitled to insist on the performance by JACS of its contractual obligations. And it may well be that the Club has some equitable remedy in respect of the purported exercise of the Clause 8a option – but it is not a beneficial entitlement to the Option Land in place of White City Holdings.42 So far as Clause 8b is concerned, while the intent was that in default of exercise of the Clause 8a option, the Club was to have the Clause 8b option, it would only become beneficially entitled to the Option Land upon valid exercise of that option, and there is no evidence that that has ever occurred. If the Clause 8a option was not validly exercised, then the apparent position would be that, neither JACS nor the Club having exercised the option, neither has any further right to occupy or have any interest in the land [Clause 11]. Accordingly, if exercise by JACS of the Clause 8a option were declared void, the result would not be to resurrect any option that the Club might have had but did not exercise.43 Nor does the Club have any further rights under the Lease, which on any basis expired on 30 September 2007 [Clauses 17a, 19, 20]. 44 Accordingly, although there is a seriously arguable case that JACS was not entitled to exercise the Clause 8a option in the manner in which it has purported to do so, I cannot see any basis upon which the Club is entitled to remain in occupation of the Option Land after 31 October 2007.The balance of convenience 
     
      
    45 As to the balance of convenience, if an injunction is not granted, the Club will have no clubhouse at White City, will be unable to continue to operate a tennis club there, may be unable to remain registered as a club if it has no premises from which to operate, and may well suffer cancellation of memberships by some members. These detriments to the Club will not readily be capable of remedy, if at all, in the event that it ultimately succeeds. 46 No prejudice or inconvenience to Poplar from an interlocutory injunction has been identified. There is evidence that the Option Land – which is three times the size of the Maccabi Land – includes other clubhouse facilities (including, at least, the clubhouse under the northern stand) which JACS will exclusively be entitled to use if the Club quits it. There is no evidence of what are the activities of JACS, and there is no evidence as that user by the Club of the interim Maccabi clubhouse – or the rest of the Maccabi Land – would prejudice JACS or Poplar, having regard to the terms of the White City agreement.47 The balance of convenience strongly favours the grant rather than the withholding of interlocutory relief. Conclusion and orders 
     
      
    48 Although this is an interlocutory application, the decisive issues are not questions of contested fact but questions of law. The Court should, if it can, determine those questions. Although I have taken into account that the balance of convenience strongly favours the grant rather than the withholding of interlocutory relief, a circumstance that can potentially lower the threshold for the “seriously arguable case” requirement, it does not do so where the decisive issue is a question of law that the court is able to determine on the interlocutory application.49 Under the White City Agreement, Maccabi is not entitled to use and occupation of the eastern stand clubhouse to the exclusion of the Option Land Owner, Poplar. By granting the Club a licence to use the eastern stand clubhouse, but not otherwise, the Maccabi Licence exceeds what is reasonable and incidental to Maccabi’s possession, use and enjoyment of the property in common with Poplar, and unreasonably interferes with Poplar’s possession, use and enjoyment of the property. Accordingly, to that extent, the Maccabi Licence was revocable by Poplar, and has been revoked. The Club does not have a sufficiently seriously arguable case for a final injunction restraining JACS and Poplar from interfering with its contractual rights under the Maccabi Licence in respect of the eastern stand clubhouse, though it does with respect to the other aspects of the licence.50 Although there is a seriously arguable case that JACS was not entitled to exercise the Clause 8a option in the manner in which it has purported to do so, that does not found any entitlement of the Club to remain in occupation of the Option Land after 31 October 2007. Nor does the Club have any further right to do so under the Lease, which on any basis expired on 30 September 2007.51 My orders are: 
     
      
      
      1. Upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving to the court the usual undertaking as to damages, order that until further order the defendants be restrained from, by themselves, their servants or agents, doing or suffering to be done any act, matter or thing that is calculated to prevent or interfere with the enjoyment by the plaintiff of its rights as licensee under the Deed of Licence between the third defendant as licensor and the plaintiff as licensee dated 19 September 2007 (“the Maccabi Licence”), other than use of the space under the eastern centre court stand allocated to Maccabi for a temporary clubhouse pursuant to Clause 13 of the agreement entitled White City Agreement dated 29 June 2005 between the trustees of the Sydney Grammar School, the third defendant, the first defendant and the plaintiff (“the White City Agreement”), including without limiting the generality of the foregoing by preventing or interfering with the use by the plaintiff, its servants, agents or invitees of: 
       
       
        
        1.1 the six synthetic courts on the south eastern portion of the land in Folio Identifier 3/234605 allocated to Maccabi pursuant to Clause 5a of the White City Agreement;  
         
         
        1.2 the thirty car parking spaces allocated to Maccabi pursuant to Clause 5b of the White City Agreement; and 
        
       
       
        
        1.3 access between those car parking spaces and courts (but not the said clubhouse) as referred to in Clause 5d of the White City Agreement. 
        
       
       
       2. Order that costs of the interlocutory application be costs in the proceedings. 
       
       
      3. Adjourn the Motion for Expedition to a date and time to be fixed before the Expedition List Judge.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova scotia








Criminal law — Young persons — Evidence —
Admissibility of statements — Waiver of rights — Whether Crown must prove not
only that necessary explanation given in appropriate and understandable
language, but also that young person understood — Whether must be proven by
Crown beyond reasonable doubt — Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002,
c. 1 , s. 146 .

 

The accused young person was charged with dangerous
driving causing bodily harm.  Upon his arrest, the police read the young person
a form advising him of his right to retain and instruct counsel, to consult a
parent or an adult relative in private, and to have a lawyer and adult present
while a statement was taken.  The young person said he understood.  The police
also read him a waiver of rights form, which he signed.  Following a voir
dire, the Youth Justice Court judge ruled that the young person’s
videotaped statement was inadmissible.  She ruled that the Crown had to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary and that the
requirements of s. 146  of the Youth Criminal Justice Act  (“YCJA ”)
relating to the taking of statements given by young persons to authority
figures had been met.  The judge was not convinced that the young person fully
understood his rights and options before giving his statement.  The Court of
Appeal set aside the verdict of acquittal and ordered a new trial.

 

Held:  The
appeal should be allowed.

 








Per McLachlin C.J.
and LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ.:  The procedural rights set out in
s. 146  represent one instance of the enhanced protection Parliament has
seen fit to provide for young persons.  The relevant parts of s. 146 
provide that no statement by a young person to a person in authority will be
admissible in evidence against that young person unless:  (i) the statement was
voluntary (s. 146(2)(a)); (ii) the person who took it “clearly
explained to the young person, in language appropriate to his or her age and
understanding” the young person’s right to silence and right to consult counsel
and another appropriate adult (and the requirement that any person consulted be
present during the interview) (s. 146(2)(b)); and (iii) the young
person was given a reasonable opportunity to exercise those rights
(s. 146(2)(c)).  Finally, s. 146(4) provides that young
persons, subject to certain conditions, can waive their right to consult
counsel and an adult before making the statement and can also waive the right
to have counsel and the adult present when the statement is made.  [18]

 

The test for compliance with s. 146(2)(b) is
objective.  It does not require the Crown to prove that a young person in fact
understood the rights and options explained to them.  That said, compliance
presupposes an individualized approach that takes into account the age and
understanding of the particular young person being questioned.  An
individualized, objective approach must take into account the level of
sophistication of the young person and other personal characteristics relevant
to their understanding.  Police officers, in determining the appropriate
language to use in explaining a young person’s rights, must therefore make a
reasonable effort to become aware of significant factors of this sort, such as
learning disabilities and previous experience with the criminal justice
system.  [21] [30] 

 

All of the factors listed in s. 146(2) have been
determined by Parliament to be appropriate preconditions to the admissibility
of a statement by a young person and all must be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.  [34]

 








Where a trial judge is not satisfied that the young
person understood his or her right to consult counsel and a parent and have
those people present during the statement, or, is not satisfied that the young
person appreciated the consequences of waiving those rights, the statement should
not be admitted.  [46]

 

Adopting a single standard of proof for compliance with
each component of s. 146  offers significant advantages over a fragmented
approach. It is consistent, moreover, with the relevant principles of
statutory interpretation — in particular, the presumption that legislation is
internally consistent and coherent.  The provisions of the YCJA  should
be read harmoniously.  In accordance with the presumption of coherence,
s. 146  must be interpreted in light of the YCJA ’s declaration of principles
(s. 3 ).  Those principles emphasize fairness and proportionality
consistent with young persons’ higher levels of dependency and lower levels of
maturity and the related need for greater procedural protections. 
Section 146 , in its entirety, is aimed at fulfilling one of the objectives
of the legislation — to offer enhanced protection to young persons and ensure
they are treated fairly.  In practical terms, adopting a single standard
ensures that the trial judge’s mind is properly directed to this task.  [47]

 

The trial judge was therefore bound to find the
statements inadmissible if she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the young person’s rights were explained to him in language appropriate to his
understanding or if she had a reasonable doubt whether the young person
understood his right to counsel and therefore could validly waive it.  It is
clear from her reasons that she was left with a reasonable doubt in both
respects.  [52]

 








The issue of whether a detained youth has received a
clear explanation of his rights and options, and whether he has understood
those rights to the extent necessary for an effective waiver, are essentially
questions of fact.  Here, the trial judge’s finding is supported by the record
and is entitled to deference.  There is no reason to interfere with her ruling
on the admissibility of the statement.  [55‑56]

 

Per Deschamps, Charron
and Rothstein JJ.:  The common law standard of proof, with respect to
preliminary questions pertaining to the admissibility of evidence, is proof on
the balance of probabilities.  Imposing a reasonable doubt standard in
s. 146(2)(b) and (4) would create an inconsistency between these
provisions and all other common law preconditions relating to the admissibility
of evidence.  In the context of waiver of a right guaranteed by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , including the right to counsel, the well‑established
standard is proof on a balance of probabilities.  To hold otherwise would
create a hierarchy of Charter  rights contrary to the principle
established by this Court.  A reasonable doubt standard would be contrary to
s. 146(1)  in view of the express direction in s. 146(1)  that the
common law relating to the admissibility of statements applies to the informational
and waiver requirements.  This Court ought not read in a statutory requirement
that Parliament did not include and that is inconsistent with the necessary
implication of other terms Parliament did use.  For these reasons, the standard
of proof for compliance with the informational and waiver requirements in
s. 146  is proof on a balance of probabilities.  [98‑100]

 








It would appear from the trial judge’s reasons that,
even if she had properly applied a balance of probabilities standard to
compliance by the police with s. 146 , her findings of non‑compliance
would not have changed.  Absent some palpable and overriding error which
affected her assessment of the facts, her findings should not be overturned. 
[101‑102]

Fish J. —

 

I

 

[1]    
Young persons, even more than adults, are inclined to feel vulnerable
when questioned by police officers who suspect them of crime and can influence
their fate.  Parliament has for that reason provided them by statute with a
complementary set of enhanced procedural safeguards in s. 146  of the Youth
Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1  (“YCJA ”), which governs the
admissibility of statements made to persons in authority by young persons who
are accused of committing offences.  








 

[2]    
Section 146  gives statutory expression to common law rules and
constitutional rights that apply to adults and to young persons alike.  It
provides, for example, that no statement by a young person to a person in
authority will be admissible in evidence against that young person unless it is
voluntary. And it reaffirms the right to counsel enshrined in s. 10  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  

 

[3]    
Parliament has recognized in this way that the right to counsel and the
right to silence are intimately related.  And that relationship is underscored
in s. 146  by the additional requirements that must be satisfied in order for
statements made by young persons to be admissible against them at their trials.
Parliament has in this way underscored the generally accepted proposition that
procedural and evidentiary safeguards available to adults do not adequately protect
young persons, who are presumed on account of their age and relative
unsophistication to be more vulnerable than adults to suggestion, pressure and
influence in the hands of police interrogators. 

 

[4]    
Accordingly, s. 146 provides that statements made by young persons are
inadmissible against them unless the persons who took them “clearly explained
to the young person, in language appropriate to his or her age and
understanding”, the specific rights conferred by s. 146. This condition of
admissibility has been referred to as the “informational requirement” of s. 146
and it raises two questions that, again, are intimately related.

 








[5]    
The first is whether the Crown must prove not only that the necessary
explanation was given in appropriate and understandable language, but also that
it was in fact understood by the young person who made the statement. 
The second is whether compliance with the informational requirement must be
proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, or only on a balance of
probabilities.  

 

[6]    
Because of their interdependence, and for other reasons to be later
explained, I would answer both questions together.  In my view, the Crown’s
evidentiary burden will be discharged by clear and convincing evidence that the
person to whom the statement was made took reasonable steps to ensure that the
young person who made it understood his or her rights under s. 146  YCJA . 
A mere probability of compliance  is incompatible with the object and scheme of
s. 146 , read as a whole.  Compliance must be established beyond a reasonable
doubt.  

 

[7]    
Finally, s. 146 provides that young persons, subject to certain
conditions, can waive their right under that section to consult with counsel
and an adult relative before making a statement and their right to have counsel
and the relative present when the statement is made. As we shall see, an
unbroken line of authority, beginning with Korponay v. Attorney General of
Canada, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, establishes that a waiver must be established
by “clear and unequivocal [evidence] that the person is waiving the procedural
safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was
enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on those rights in
the process” (p. 49 (emphasis deleted)).  Manifestly, where Parliament has
specifically sought to endow young persons with enhanced procedural
protections, this high standard has not been satisfied if the court is left
with a reasonable doubt whether the requirements set out in Korponay and
subsequently reaffirmed, have been met. 

 








[8]    
I hasten to add, however, that this exacting standard should not be
taken to impose on the Crown a burden that it cannot properly be expected to
discharge.  Where compliance with the informational component is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge will be entitled — and, indeed,
expected — to infer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the young
person in fact understood his or her rights under s. 146.  

 

[9]    
In this case, the trial judge was not satisfied that the Crown
discharged its burden under s. 146  YCJA .  She therefore found the
appellant’s statement inadmissible and ultimately entered an acquittal. The
Court of Appeal disagreed. For the foregoing reasons, and the reasons that
follow, I would allow the appeal and restore the appellant’s acquittal at
trial.

 

II

 

[10] The
appellant, L.T.H., was arrested after a police chase in the early morning hours
of August 8, 2004.  He was taken into custody and asked, several times, whether
he wished to contact counsel. He declined.  

 

[11] L.T.H.
was taken to the Cole Harbour RCMP detachment at approximately 5:00 a.m.
Several hours later, he was taken to the Dartmouth police station where he
slept for a few hours. Approximately 12 hours after the arrest, L.T.H. was
brought to the Halifax police station and interviewed by Constable Jeffrey
Carlisle.

 








[12] In the
interview room, Constable Carlisle reviewed a young offender statement form
with L.T.H. Asked by the officer whether he understood his rights, L.T.H. said
“yes”.  He said he did not wish to call a lawyer or to talk to a lawyer in
private.  Likewise, he answered “no” when asked if he wanted to consult in
private with a parent or another appropriate adult, or to have them present
while giving a statement or while being questioned.

 

[13] The
appellant interrupted the reading of the form at one point and stated that he
was not going to answer all of the questions asked of him. The officer told him
that the questions did not relate to the incident and were only “do you
understand?” questions. Constable Carlisle then finished reading the form.
After the appellant initialled and signed the waiver of rights, the officer
proceeded to interview him.  L.T.H. provided an inculpatory statement that
subsequently formed the basis of the Crown’s case against him.  The interview
with L.T.H. was videotaped by the police and, at the invitation of counsel for
the parties, we have viewed and listened to that videotape. 

 

[14] The
appellant’s mother testified on the voir dire. She stated that her son
had a learning disorder, and that she had told this to a police officer at the
Dartmouth police station, before the appellant was taken by the police to
Halifax and questioned there. She also testified that on other occasions, when
she had been with her son during police questioning, he would rely on her to
explain the questions. The appellant did not testify.

 








[15] Following
the voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the videotaped statement of
L.T.H. was inadmissible ((2005), 236 N.S.R. (2d) 180, 2005 NSPC 36). She was
satisfied that the statement was voluntary, but not convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statutory requirements of ss. 146(2)(b) and
146(4) had been met. In particular, she was not convinced that L.T.H.
understood his rights and the consequences of waiving them. The Crown called no
further evidence and the charge was dismissed. 

 

[16] The
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal
and ordered a new trial ((2006), 248 N.S.R. (2d) 285, 2006 NSCA 112). It found
that, while the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the young
person was provided with a clear and appropriate explanation of his or her
rights and options as set out in s. 146(2)(b), the Crown does not need
to prove that the young person in fact understood those rights. The Court of
Appeal acknowledged that subjective understanding is a precondition for valid
waiver pursuant to s. 146(4). It found, however, that the Crown must prove
waiver on a balance of probabilities rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

III

 

[17] Section
3  YCJA  contains a declaration of principles. In relevant part, it
provides:

 

(b) the
criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults
and emphasize the following:

 

. . .

 

(iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are
treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are
protected,

 








[18] The
procedural rights set out in s. 146  represent one instance of the enhanced
protection Parliament has seen fit to provide for young persons. The relevant
parts of s. 146  provide that no statement by a young person to a person in
authority will be admissible in evidence against that young person unless: (1)
the statement was voluntary (s. 146(2)(a)); (2) the person who took it
“clearly explained to the young person, in language appropriate to his or her
age and understanding” the young person’s right to silence and right to consult
counsel and another appropriate adult (and the requirement that any person
consulted be present during the interview) (s. 146(2)(b)); and (3) the
young person was given a reasonable opportunity to exercise those rights (s.
146(2)(c)). Finally, s. 146(4) provides that young persons, subject to
certain conditions, can waive their right to consult counsel and an adult
before making the statement and can also waive the right to have counsel and
the adult present when the statement is made. The full text of the section is
attached as an Appendix. 

 

IV

 

[19] The
trial judge appears to have concluded that compliance with s. 146(2)(b)
— the informational component — requires the judge to be satisfied that the
young person in fact understood the rights and options explained to him
pursuant to that section.  The Court of Appeal held, on the contrary, that the
Crown need only prove that the person in authority clearly explained the
young person’s rights in appropriate language. 

 

[20] Both
parties have characterized the trial judge’s approach as a “subjective” test
for determining the adequacy of the required caution.  The test adopted by the
Court of Appeal, they agree, is “objective” instead. 

 








[21] In my
view, the test for compliance with the informational component is objective. It
does not require the Crown to prove that a young person in fact understood the
rights and options explained to that young person pursuant to s. 146(2)(b).
That said, compliance presupposes an individualized approach that takes into
account the age and understanding of the particular youth being questioned (N.
Bala, Youth Criminal Justice Law (2003), at p. 220).

 

[22] A
purposive interpretation of s. 146(2)(b) makes clear that it requires
persons in authority to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the young
detainee to be questioned is capable of understanding the explanation of the
rights being given. This follows from the clear wording of the section: The
explanation must be provided in language appropriate to the particular young
person’s age and understanding. Without some knowledge of the young
person’s level of understanding, the officer will be unable to demonstrate that
the explanation was tailored to the capabilities of the young person concerned.

 

[23] The
kind of reasonable efforts that must be made by police officers were ably
summarized in R. v. C.G., 1986 CarswellOnt 1556 (Prov. Ct. (Fam. Div.)):


 

. . . persons
in authority taking statements must learn something about the educational level
of the child, the language and vocabulary skills of the child, his faculties of
understanding, his emotional state at the time. These inquiries do not
call for the intervention of a psychologist, or a telephone call to the school
teacher, or even to a parent. But they do require enough conversation with the
young person, to permit the officer to determine how many phrases must be
explained and to what extent he must use ordinary or street language or even
slang to be sure the child understands what is being said. 

 

. . .

 








Section 56 [of the Young Offenders Act, the
predecessor to s. 146  YCJA ] will require evidence on a voir
dire from the person(s) in authority that he had a reasonable basis for
forming an opinion as to the “age and understanding” of a young person.
[Emphasis in original; paras. 29 and 34.]

 

[24] This
Court has consistently held that the rationale for s. 146 , and its predecessor,
lies in Parliament’s recognition that young persons generally do not understand
their legal rights as well as adults, are less likely to assert those rights in
the face of a confrontation with a person in authority and are more susceptible
to the pressures of interrogation (R. v. I. (L.R.) and T. (E.), [1993] 4
S.C.R. 504, at p. 522; and R. v. J. (J.T.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 755). Given
the purpose of the provision, it would be inconsistent to find that the
statutory requirements of s. 146  will be complied with whenever a clearly
worded form is read to a young person.

 

[25] Even
before the enactment of the YCJA  and its predecessor, trial courts
recognized that statements made by young persons should be treated differently
than statements made by adults. In R. v. Yensen, [1961] O.R. 703 
(H.C.), for example, McRuer C.J.H.C. held that the interrogating officer must
“demonstrate to the Court that the child did understand the caution as a result
of careful explanation and pointing out to the child the consequences that may
flow from making the statement” (p. 711).  See also:  Re A., [1975] 5
W.W.R. 425 (Alta. S.C.).

 








[26] I take
care not to be understood to require police officers, as the trial judge
apparently did in this case, to ask young persons in every case to “recite
back” or “explain back” their rights.  In some instances, this may well demonstrate
that the explanation was both appropriate and sufficient.  And it may tend to
show that the rights waived were in fact understood — which is of course
essential to the validity of the waiver.  But “reciting back” or “explaining
back” is not transformed by its evident utility into a legal requirement under
s. 146 .

 

[27] The
reading of a standardized form will not normally suffice in itself to
establish the sufficiency of the caution required by s. 146(2)(b). 
Persons in authority must, in addition, acquire some insight into the level of
comprehension of the young person concerned, since the mandatory explanation
must be appropriate to the age and understanding of that young person.  In
the words of the Manitoba Court of Appeal  in R. v. B.S.M. (1995), 100
Man. R. (2d) 151:

 

The simple reading of an appropriate waiver form to an accused young
person will not generally constitute a clear explanation of his rights or of
the consequences of signing a waiver. What will constitute a clear explanation
will depend on the facts of a particular case. I would suggest that the mere
reading of a waiver form accompanied by the repeated question “do you
understand?” would normally fall short of satisfying the statutory
requirements. Parliament has expressly stated that young people require more
than the offering of information. They require not just explanations, but clear
explanations that they are able to understand. [para. 9]

 

[28] Properly
crafted and scrupulously applied, standardized forms nonetheless provide a
useful framework for the appropriate interrogation of young detainees.  This
point was well made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. S. (S.) (2007),
222 C.C.C. (3d) 545, 2007 ONCA 481, at para. 37: 

 

It is apparent that a uniform form that correctly addresses all of the
procedural protections would facilitate uniform compliance with s. 146(2) and,
more importantly, would ensure that a young person had his or her rights, and
the obligations of the police, clearly explained.

 








In short,
adherence to standardized forms can facilitate, but will not always constitute,
compliance with s. 146(2)(b).  Compliance is a matter of substance, not
form.  The trial court must be satisfied, upon considering all of the evidence,
that the young person’s rights were in fact explained clearly and
comprehensibly by the person in authority.  As Sopinka J. explained in I.
(L.R.):

 

. . . the purpose of the requirement that the explanation prescribed by
s. 56 precede the making of the statement is to ensure that the young person
does not relinquish the right to silence except in the exercise of free will in
the context of a full understanding and appreciation of his or her rights.
[Emphasis added; p. 528.]

 

[29] The
requirement of understanding and appreciation applies to all young persons,
including those who are no strangers to the criminal justice system.  Section
146(2)(b) incorporates principles of fairness that must “be applied
uniformly to all without regard to the characteristics of the particular young
person” (J. (J.T.), at p. 768).

 

[30] This
does not mean that experience in the criminal justice system is irrelevant to
the inquiry as to the young person’s understanding. An individualized,
objective approach must take into account the level of sophistication of the
young detainee and other personal characteristics relevant to the young
person’s understanding.  Police officers, in determining the appropriate
language to use in explaining a young person’s rights, must therefore make a
reasonable effort to become aware of significant factors of this sort, such as
learning disabilities and previous experience with the criminal justice system.


 

V

 








[31] The YCJA 
does not establish the standard of proof the Crown must meet in demonstrating
compliance with s. 146 . In this case, the trial judge held that the burden
rested with the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that L.T.H. fully
understood the rights and options that he waived before providing a statement
to police. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that compliance with
s. 146(2) (b) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Unlike the trial
judge, however, it held that the onus is on the Crown to establish waiver on a
balance of probabilities. 

 

[32] In my
view, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should instead be applied
throughout. This standard is most consistent with the purposes of the
provision, the common law in relation to the admissibility of statements, and
the high standard the Court has consistently required to prove valid waiver.

 

[33] In
enacting the YCJA , and specifically the statutory requirements set out
in s. 146 , Parliament created a statutory scheme which addresses the reduced
capacity of young people to understand their rights and their increased
disposition to answer questions put to them by persons in authority. As Cory J.
explained in J. (J.T.), at p. 766, Parliament has “recognized the
problems and difficulties that beset young people when confronted with
authority”:

 








A young person is usually far more easily impressed and influenced by
authoritarian figures.  No matter what the bravado and braggadocio that young
people may display, it is unlikely that they will appreciate their legal rights
in a general sense or the consequences of oral statements made to persons in
authority; certainly they would not appreciate the nature of their rights to
the same extent as would most adults. Teenagers may also be more susceptible to
subtle threats arising from their surroundings and the presence of persons in
authority.  A young person may be more inclined to make a statement, even
though it is false, in order to please an authoritarian figure.  It was no
doubt in recognition of the additional pressures and problems faced by young
people that led Parliament to enact this code of procedure. [pp. 766-67]

 

[34] For
this reason, Parliament has required that admissible statements must not only
be voluntary but, in addition, be preceded by a clear explanation of the young
person’s rights. All of the factors listed in s. 146(2) have been determined by
Parliament to be appropriate preconditions to the admissibility of a statement
by a young person and all must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

[35] Section
146(2)(a) provides that a statement will be inadmissible unless it is
voluntary. At common law, it is well established that the Crown must prove
voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt (see, for example, R. v. Singh,
[2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, 2007 SCC 48, at para. 25).

 

[36] By
codifying the requirement of voluntariness in s. 146(2)(a), Parliament
should also be taken to have incorporated the associated burden of proof.
Indeed, it is not in dispute that the governing standard of persuasion for
voluntariness pursuant to s. 146(2)(a) is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.  The Crown argues that the reasonable doubt standard, however, should
not apply to proof of compliance with s. 146(2)(b), since this provision
is directed at enhancing a young person’s right to silence and to counsel, and
(unlike voluntariness) is not strongly linked to the reliability of the
statement.  Similarly, Justice Rothstein finds that voluntariness is “different
from all other preconditions” because it alone always casts doubt on the
reliability of a statement made by a young person to a person in authority
(para. 79).

 








[37] With
respect, I am not persuaded by these arguments.  While the primary concern of
voluntariness may be with reliability, the expanded notion of the confessions
rule articulated in Singh is concerned as well with respect for an
individual’s freedom of will. As Charron J. explained, the confessions rule
“clearly includes the right of the detained person to make a meaningful choice
whether or not to speak to state authorities” (para. 35).

 

[38] Moreover,
like the confessions rule, the informational requirements set out in
s. 146(2) (b) are indeed meant to ensure the reliability of a
statement.  In particular, the requirements are aimed at preventing false
confessions by young people inclined to make a statement in order to end the
pressure of interrogation or to please an authority figure (J. (J.T.),
at pp. 766-67) and at ensuring that any statement given manifests the exercise
of free will (I. (L.R.), at p. 528). And, as with voluntariness, the
Crown bears the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutory
requirements have been met. In regard to voluntariness, the “mere presence of a
doubt as to the exercise of the detainee’s free will in making the statement
will suffice to ground a remedy” (Singh, at para. 38). In the context of
s. 146(2)  YCJA , doubt may well arise in the evaluation of the
voluntariness of the statement or the adequacy of the statutorily mandated
caution. A doubt in regard to either precondition provides a sufficient basis for
excluding the statement.

 

[39] With
respect to the standard of proof for waiver, reasonable doubt is likewise
appropriate. This standard best harmonizes with the elements necessary to
establish a valid waiver.

 








[40] Like
adults, young people can waive their right to counsel. They may also waive
their unique right to have counsel and an adult present during the making of a
statement.  However, as in the adult context, a waiver will be valid only if
the judge is satisfied that it is premised on a true understanding of the
rights involved and the consequences of giving them up.

 

[41] This
Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the test for valid waiver of the Charter  right
to counsel under s. 10 (b) and has indicated that the standard required
for such a waiver is very high (see, for example, R. v. Prosper, [1994]
3 S.C.R. 236; Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383; R. v.
Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233; and R. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
869). According to Lamer C.J., “a person who waives a right must know what he
or she is giving up if the waiver is to be valid” (Prosper, at p. 275,
citing R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173).

 

[42] This
unbroken line of authority begins with Korponay, where the Court held
that the validity of a waiver of a statutory right is 

 

dependent upon it being clear and unequivocal that the person is
waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the
rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will
have on those rights in the process.  [Emphasis in original; p. 49.]

 

[43] This
passage was cited with approval by Wilson J. in Clarkson, at pp. 394-95,
in the context of waiver of a Charter  right. She found as well that “any
voluntary waiver in order to be valid and effective must be premised on a true
appreciation of the consequences of giving up the right” (p. 396). A clear and
unequivocal waiver is thus essential, but not sufficient: it must be
accompanied by a proper understanding of the purpose the right was meant to serve
and an appreciation of the consequences of declining its protection. 

 








[44] We are
not concerned in this case with the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence,
as, for example, on an application by the accused under ss. 10 (b) and
24(2)  of the Charter . On the contrary, our concern is with the
admissibility, at the Crown’s behest, of incriminating evidence which
Parliament has subjected to mandatory conditions set out in s. 146  YCJA .

 

[45] The
Crown has failed to persuade me that a requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt represents an anomalous departure from the Court’s established
jurisprudence. It is true that in the context of the s. 11 (b) Charter 
right to a trial within a reasonable time and the s. 14  right to an
interpreter, the Court has said, without discussion, that the Crown bears the
burden of proving waiver on a balance of probabilities (see R. v. Askov,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, and R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951). Nothing in
either judgment provides any rationale for the adoption in the present context
of that standard. 

 

[46] Parliament
has considered it right and necessary to afford young persons rights and
procedural safeguards which they alone enjoy. Young persons should not lightly
be found to have relinquished this enhanced level of protection they were found
by Parliament to require. Where a trial judge is not satisfied that the young
person understood his or her right to consult counsel and a parent and to have
those people present during the statement, or, is not satisfied that the young
person appreciated the consequences of waiving those rights, the statement
should not be admitted. 

 








[47] Adopting
a single standard of proof for compliance with each component of s. 146  offers
significant advantages over a fragmented approach.  It is consistent, moreover,
with the relevant principles of statutory interpretation — in particular, the
presumption that legislation is internally consistent and coherent. As R.
Sullivan explains, the provisions of a statute are

 

presumed to
fit together logically to form a rational, internally consistent framework; and
because the framework has a purpose the parts are also presumed to work
together dynamically, each contributing something toward accomplishing the
intended goal.

 

(Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (4th ed.
2002), at p. 168)

 

The provisions
of the YCJA  should be read harmoniously. In accordance with the
presumption of coherence, s. 146  must be interpreted in light of the YCJA ’s
declaration of principles (s. 3 ). Those principles emphasize fairness and
proportionality consistent with young persons’ higher levels of dependency and
lower levels of maturity and the related need for greater procedural
protections.  Section 146 , in its entirety, is aimed at fulfilling one of the
objectives of the legislation — to offer enhanced protection to young persons
and ensure they are treated fairly. In practical terms, adopting a single
standard ensures that the trial judge’s mind is properly directed to this task.

 

[48] The
Crown contends that requiring proof of actual understanding on the normal
criminal standard will prove elusive. This is a reasonable but ultimately
unwarranted concern. I am not persuaded that imposing a uniform burden of proof
under s. 146  places an unduly onerous burden on the Crown. If the trial judge
is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the rights and options of the
young person were in fact explained in the manner required by s. 146 , a
presumption will arise that the young person in fact understood those
rights and the effect of waiving them.  Trial judges will therefore be expected
to draw that inference in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  

 








[49] It
should be remembered as well that, in virtue of s. 146(5) and (6), youth court
judges may admit statements affected by technical irregularities, provided they
are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the substantive requirements of s.
146  have been met. 

 

VI

 

[50] The
trial judge (at paras. 12 and 16) appears to have considered that proof of
subjective understanding was necessary to establish compliance with s. 146(2) (b).
With respect, as earlier explained, I think it unnecessary to establish by
affirmative evidence that the young person in fact understood the explanation
required by that provision.  Nor, would I impose, as the trial judge apparently
did, an additional mandatory requirement that police officers ask young persons
to “explain back” their rights.  The Crown has failed to persuade me, however,
that absent these findings there is a reasonable possibility that the trial
judge’s ruling on admissibility would have been different.

 

[51] The
trial judge did not err in finding that police officers must form an opinion as
to the level of understanding of the accused. A failure, as in this case, to
make any inquiry in this regard will generally prove fatal to the admissibility
of the statement, since the Crown must demonstrate that the explanation given
was appropriately tailored to the particular young person. Moreover, the trial
judge was not satisfied that L.T.H.  clearly understood his rights and the
ramifications of waiving them before doing so.

 








[52] The
trial judge was bound to find the statements inadmissible if she was not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that L.T.H.’s rights were explained to him
in language appropriate to his understanding or if she had a reasonable
doubt whether  L.T.H. understood his right to counsel and therefore could
validly waive it. It is clear from her reasons that she was left with a
reasonable doubt in both respects. 

 

[53] In
concluding that the Crown had not discharged its burden in this case, the trial
judge noted the officer’s rapid pace in navigating the waiver form, the lack of
eye contact with L.T.H. and the officer’s monotone voice. She noted that there
was no evidence, apart from his affirmative reply to repeated questions of “do
you understand?”, that L.T.H. understood his rights and the officer made no
effort to establish his level of understanding. The trial judge made particular
reference to L.T.H.’s comment, midway through the reading of the form, to the
effect that he was not going to answer all of the questions being asked of him.
This led her to wonder whether he really understood the importance of the
questions and the answers he was giving (para. 35).

 

[54] The
trial judge found that the completion of the form amounted to a mere
formality.  This, and evidence she heard as to the appellant’s learning
disability, caused her to have “grave concerns” about whether L.T.H. understood
his rights. On this basis, she ruled that the statement of the appellant was
inadmissible pursuant to s. 146 . She was entitled to do so. 

 








[55] Like
voluntariness, the issue of whether a detained youth has received a clear
explanation of his rights and options, and whether he has understood those
rights to the extent necessary for an effective waiver, are essentially
questions of fact. In R. v. Oickle, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, 2000 SCC 38, at
para. 71, the Court held that a finding of voluntariness “should only be
overturned for ‘some palpable and overriding error which affected [the
trial judge’s] assessment of the facts’:  Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1
S.C.R. 254, at p. 279 (quoting Stein v. The Ship “Kathy K”, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 802, at p. 808) (emphasis in Schwartz)”. The same is true for
findings made pursuant to s. 146 .

 

[56] In my
view, the trial judge’s finding on the issue of compliance with s. 146   is
supported by the record and is entitled to deference. I therefore see no reason
to interfere with her ruling on the admissibility of the statement. 

 

VII

 

[57] I
conclude with three observations concerning the reasons of Rothstein J.

 

[58] First,
there is a recognized exception to the general rule that preliminary findings
of fact may be determined on a balance of probabilities.  Proof beyond a
reasonable doubt will be required instead “in those certainly rare occasions
when admission of the evidence may itself have a conclusive effect with respect
to guilt” (R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 71).  The
appellant’s incriminating statement to the police clearly falls within that
recognized exception.  And that is the evidence in issue here.  Indeed, as I
mentioned earlier, our concern is with the admissibility of a statement that formed
the basis of the Crown’s case against the appellant.

 

[59] Justice
Rothstein cites (at para. 83) the passage in Arp that sets out the
exception to which I have just referred.  For ease of reference, I reproduce
the relevant part of that passage here:  

 








. . . the general rule that preliminary findings of fact may be
determined on a balance of probabilities is departed from in those certainly
rare occasions when admission of the evidence may itself have a
conclusive effect with respect to guilt. For example, where the Crown
adduces a statement of the accused made to a person in authority, the trial
judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the voluntariness of the
statement. That evidence may of itself, if accepted as true, provide conclusive
proof of guilt. Since doubt about the statement’s voluntariness also casts
doubt on its reliability, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is warranted.
[Emphasis added; para. 71.]

 

Justice
Rothstein and I part company in only one important regard.  If Justice Cory
considered that the voluntariness of a statement to a person in authority was
the only occasion requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he would
not have characterized it as an example of the occasions that do;
likewise, since Justice Cory characterized voluntariness as an example, he
cannot have meant that voluntariness is the only matter requiring proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, as contended by Justice Rothstein. With respect,
moreover, I see nothing anywhere else in Arp to suggest that the
voluntariness of a statement to a person in authority is the only matter
requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt — and not merely an example,
as indicated by Justice Cory in the passage cited by my colleague.  The
contrary appears to be true.

 

[60] Second,
in none of the decisions relied on by my colleague has a court admitted
a statement made by an accused to a person in authority where the court was
left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the requirements for admissibility
had been met. R. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, cited by my colleague in
this regard, did not involve a statement made by an accused to a person in
authority.

 








[61] I can
see no reason to adopt a standard less onerous than the common law imposes
where Parliament, as in s. 146  YCJA , has expressly subjected the
admissibility of a statement made by a young person to a person in authority not
only to the requirement of voluntariness, but to additional conditions as well.

 

[62] Third,
Justice Rothstein rests his divergent conclusion, at least in part, on an
apparent misapprehension of my reasons. He understands me to have adopted the
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the informational and
waiver requirements go to the voluntariness of the statement.  With respect, I
am unable to find anything in my reasons to that effect.

 

[63] My
reasons, and indeed the wording of s. 146 , make clear that compliance with the
informational component and the establishment of waiver are not simply “two
factors which are to be considered and weighed by the judge, together with
other relevant factors, in deciding whether the statement was made voluntarily”
(Rothstein J., at para. 90).  They are distinct and independent
requirements of admissibility. Even where voluntariness has been established
beyond a reasonable doubt (as the trial judge found in this case), the
statement must be excluded where the youth has not had his or her rights
clearly explained in appropriate language or where waiver has not been
established.

 

VIII

 

[64] For
all of these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order for a new
trial and restore the appellant’s acquittal.

 








The reasons of Deschamps, Charron and Rothstein JJ. were delivered
by

 

Rothstein J.  —

 

I.      Introduction

 

[65] Section
146  of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1  (“YCJA ”),
governs the admissibility of statements made to persons in authority by young
persons who are accused of committing offences.  The relevant provisions are
contained in the Appendix of Justice Fish’s reasons.

 

[66] Two
issues are raised in this appeal.  The first is whether the Crown must prove
that in taking a statement, the person in authority not only clearly explained
to the young person, in language appropriate to his or her age and
understanding, his or her rights conferred by s. 146(2) (b) YCJA ,
but also, that it was in fact understood by the young person who made
the statement.  The second is whether compliance with the informational and
waiver requirements of s. 146(2) (b) and (4)  must be proven by the Crown
beyond a reasonable doubt or on a balance of probabilities.  

                                                                              








[67] I have
read the reasons of Justice Fish.  He says that the Crown’s evidentiary burden
will be discharged by evidence that the person to whom the statement was made
has, before the statement is made, clearly explained to the young person, in
language appropriate to his or her age and understanding, his or her rights
under s. 146(2) (b) YCJA .  Evidence of actual understanding is not
required.  I agree.  I also agree with him that the young person’s previous
experience in the youth criminal justice system may be evidence that the
caution was explained in language appropriate to the young person’s
understanding.

 

[68] As to
the second issue, I agree with Fish J. that the Crown must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statement made by the young person was voluntary. I
differ with him, however, on the standard of proof applicable to whether there
was compliance by the person in authority with the informational and waiver
requirements of s. 146  YCJA .  Fish J. says the standard is proof beyond
a reasonable doubt.  In my respectful view, the standard is proof on a balance
of probabilities.

 

II.    Analysis

 

(1)   Common Law Standard of Proof for Preliminary
Questions of Fact

 

[69] The YCJA 
does not expressly provide a standard of proof for compliance with s. 146 . 
However, s. 146(1) states:

 

Subject to this section, the law relating to the
admissibility of statements made by persons accused of committing offences
applies in respect of young persons.

 

Fish J. and I
agree that the “law” referred to in s. 146(1) is common law.  Where we differ
is in what the common law requires.

 








[70] The
common law rule relating to the admissibility of evidence is that the party
seeking to admit the evidence must establish on the balance of probabilities
preliminary matters governing the use of that evidence:  R. v. Evans,
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, at p. 668, R. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, at
pp. 947-48, and R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 70. 

 

[71] In Evans,
the type of evidence at issue was an admission by the accused in the form of
hearsay.  This Court held that, before admitting the evidence, the Crown had to
establish on a balance of probabilities the precondition that the statement was
made by the accused.  Sopinka J., writing for a majority of the Court, stated
at p. 668:

 

This Court has
affirmed that preliminary questions of fact by the trier of fact may be decided
on a balance of probabilities. . . .

 

. . . If there is some evidence to permit the issue
to be submitted to the trier of fact, the matter must be considered in two
stages.  First, a preliminary determination must be made as to whether, on the
basis of evidence admissible against the accused, the Crown has established on
a balance of probabilities that the statement is that of the accused.  If this
threshold is met, the trier of fact should then consider the contents of the
statement along with other evidence to determine the issue of innocence or
guilt.

 

[72] Only
one exception to proof on a balance of probabilities for preliminary questions
of fact governing the use of evidence has been recognized by this Court: the
confessions rule.  The definitive statement of the confessions rule came in Ibrahim
v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609:

 








It has long been established as a positive rule of
English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence
against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.

 

This Court
adopted the “Ibrahim rule” in Prosko v. The King (1922), 63
S.C.R. 226, and subsequently applied it in cases like Boudreau v. The King,
[1949] S.C.R. 262, and Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640.  

 

[73] As it
now stands, the common law confessions rule “requires proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of the voluntariness of any statement obtained from an accused by a
person in authority before it may be admitted in evidence” (R. v. Singh,
[2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, 2007 SCC 48, at para. 29).

 

[74] As
indicated by Iacobucci J. in R. v. Oickle, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, 2000 SCC
38, at para. 32, the rule is directed against the danger of false confessions. 
Involuntary confessions are more likely to be unreliable.  It is because doubt
about the statement’s voluntariness also casts doubt on its reliability that
proof beyond a reasonable doubt is warranted. 

 

In defining the confessions rule, it is important to keep in mind its
twin goals of protecting the rights of the accused without unduly limiting
society’s need to investigate and solve crimes.  Martin J.A. accurately
delineated this tension in R. v. Precourt (1976), 18 O.R. (2d) 714
(C.A.), at p. 721:

 

Although improper police questioning may in some circumstances infringe
the governing [confessions] rule it is essential to bear in mind that the
police are unable to investigate crime without putting questions to persons,
whether or not such persons are suspected of having committed the crime being
investigated.  Properly conducted police questioning is a legitimate and
effective aid to criminal investigation. . . .  On the other hand, statements
made as the result of intimidating questions, or questioning which is
oppressive and calculated to overcome the freedom of will of the suspect for
the purpose of extracting a confession are inadmissible. . . .








 

All who are
involved in the administration of justice, but particularly courts applying the
confessions rule, must never lose sight of either of these objectives.

 

(Per Iacobucci J., in Oickle, at para. 33)

 

[75] In the
case of statements made by young persons, the Crown must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt the statement’s voluntariness as statutorily required under
s. 146(2) (a) YCJA .

 

[76] Beyond
the well-established confessions rule, there have been no other cases where
proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been required by this Court or by any other
court as a precondition to admission of evidence, including statements of an
accused made to a person of authority (see D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The
Law of Evidence (4th ed. 2005), at p. 19).  

 

[77] In the
case of a statement made by a young person to a person of authority, a
precondition to the admissibility of the statement is compliance with the
informational requirement as set out in s. 146(2) (b) YCJA . 
Applying the common law principle, compliance with that preliminary
determination must be proven by the Crown on a balance of probabilities.  

 

[78] For
this reason, I cannot agree with Fish J. that proof beyond a reasonable doubt
applied throughout s. 146  is the standard most consistent with the common law
in relation to the admissibility of statements (Fish J.’s reasons, at para.
32).    

 








[79] In
particular, I cannot agree with him that just because an incriminating
statement is made to a person in authority, all preconditions to its
admissibility must be established beyond a reasonable doubt (Fish J.’s reasons,
at paras. 58 and 61).  The confessions rule is solely directed to the question
of the voluntariness of the statement and not to other preconditions to its
admissibility.  As I have explained throughout my reasons, beyond the
confessions rule, there has never been a case where proof beyond a
reasonable doubt has been found to be required as a precondition to admission
of evidence.  The precondition of voluntariness is different from all other
preconditions to admissibility since doubt about the statement’s voluntariness always
casts doubt on its reliability.  The same cannot be said about the
informational and waiver preconditions of s. 146(2) (b) and (4).  It is
quite possible for an explanation that was not adequately tailored to the age
and understanding of the young person to not cast any doubt about the
statement’s reliability.  In the rare case where an aspect of the informational
and waiver requirements does cast a doubt about the reliability of a statement,
the Crown will still be required to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt
ensuring that a statement that was not given voluntarily would not be
admissible.

 

[80] The
common law rule that all preliminary matters governing the use of evidence must
be established on the balance of probabilities has been consistently applied
even in cases where the evidence is crucial to a finding of guilt.   It has
been applied to preconditions of admissibility of various types of evidence
such as hearsay, post-offence conduct, expert and similar fact evidence: Arp,
at para. 48; Evans, at pp. 667-68; R.  v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R.
72, at para. 49; R. v. Handy, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56, at para.
55; R. v. Shearing, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, 2002 SCC 58, at para. 41; R.
v. Terceira (1998), 15 C.R. (5th) 359 (Ont. C.A.) (aff’d [1999] 3 S.C.R.
866), at para. 46.

 








Indeed, even
where the Crown leads devastating opinion evidence that the suspect DNA and the
DNA of the accused have identical characteristics leading to overwhelming odds
that the suspect DNA belonged to the accused, the preconditions to the
admission of the opinion evidence need be established only on the balance of
probabilities. [Footnote omitted.]

 

(Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 19)

 

[81] Even
in cases where evidence is an admission by the accused, this Court has
held that the preconditions to the admission of the inculpatory statement must
be established on the balance of probabilities.  See for example Evans,
where the type of evidence at issue was an admission by the accused in the form
of hearsay.  Although Evans did not involve a statement made by an
accused specifically to a person in authority, as pointed out by Fish J. at
para. 60 of his reasons, the statement was nevertheless an inculpatory
admission by the accused and crucial to a finding of guilt. 

 

[82] Fish
J. does not cite any cases in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been
applied to statutory preconditions to admissibility.    However, numerous
decisions relate to common law preconditions to the admissibility of
evidence.  In all these cases, this Court (as well as other courts) has
consistently required that the common law preconditions to the admissibility of
evidence be established on a balance of probabilities.  There is no logical
distinction between common law and statutory preconditions that would support
different standards of proof for each.  Whether statutory or common law, both
types of preconditions are requirements for admissibility of evidence and they
are subject to the same standard of proof, namely that of the balance of
probabilities.

 








[83] Fish
J. does cite Arp in support of his conclusion that “[t]he appellant’s
incriminating statement to the police clearly falls within that recognized
exception [of requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt]” (Fish J.’s reasons,
at para. 58).  He seems to be interpreting the reasons of Cory J. in Arp
as suggesting that the confessions rule should no longer be the only occasion
requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Cory J. did use the words “in those
certainly rare occasions when admission of the evidence may itself have a
conclusive effect with respect to guilt” (Arp, at para. 71).  However, I
think it would be wrong to interpret this non‑specific and narrow phrase
reference as opening the door to a broad new category of exceptions to the
common law standard of proof with respect to preliminary questions of fact. 
Such an interpretation would not adhere to the consistent jurisprudence of this
Court that, beyond the confessions rule, there has never been a case where
proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been found to be required as a precondition
to admission of evidence. 

 

[84] Because
the common law standard of proof with respect to preliminary questions of fact
governing the use of evidence is one of balance of probabilities, I cannot
agree with Fish J. that proof beyond a reasonable doubt applied throughout s.
146  is the standard most consistent with the common law in relation to the
informational and waiver requirements of  s. 146(2) (b) and (4) (Fish
J.’s reasons, at para. 32). 

 

(2)   Evidentiary Approach to Matters Preliminary
to the Question of Voluntariness

 

[85] As
discussed above, the informational and waiver requirements are examined on a
preliminary basis when determining whether the statutory requirements of s. 146 
YCJA  have been complied with.  Independent from that examination, the
informational and waiver requirements are also relied on as part of a
constellation of facts in assessing the voluntary nature of the statement.








 

[86] Fish
J. holds at para. 38: 

 

. . . like the confessions rule, the informational requirements set out
in s. 146(2) (b) are indeed meant to ensure the reliability of a
statement.  In particular, the requirements are aimed at preventing false
confessions by young people . . . and at ensuring that any statement given
manifests the exercise of free will . . . And, as with voluntariness, the Crown
bears the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutory
requirements have been met.

 

Fish J. seems to
be inferring that simply because the informational and waiver requirements are
concerned with some of the same issues as is the requirement of voluntariness,
compliance by the person in authority with the informational and waiver
requirements of s. 146(2) (b) and (4) should be subject to the standard
of beyond a reasonable doubt as it would apply to the ultimate issue of the
voluntary nature of the statement.

 

[87] I
cannot agree with this proposition.  Fish J. is collapsing the two distinct and
separate uses that are to be made of the informational and waiver requirements,
on the one hand, at the preliminary stage as statutory preconditions to
admissibility, and, on the other hand, when relied on to determine the
voluntary nature of the statement.  With respect to the use made of the
informational and waiver requirements when determining the voluntary nature of
the statement, it is well established that the criminal standard of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt is to be applied only to the ultimate issue and not
to the weighing of individual pieces of evidence that go to that ultimate
determination (R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 354-60, Stewart
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 748, at pp. 759‑61, and White,
at para. 42).








 

[88] Findings
relating to the voluntary nature of a confession, like those relating to guilt,
should not be broken down in relation to individual pieces or categories of
evidence (Stewart, at pp. 759‑61; Morin, at pp. 354-60; White,
at para. 42).  In Morin, Sopinka J., writing for the majority, stated at
p. 359:

 

The authorities reviewed above are clear that the
jury is not to examine the evidence piecemeal by reference to the criminal
standard. Otherwise, there is virtually no guidance in previous cases as to
what legal rules, if any, apply to the process of weighing the evidence.
Attempts to formulate such rules have been frowned upon.

 

All individual
items of evidence take on their full significance and probative value only in
the context of the other evidence in the case. The significance of each item of
evidence is necessarily shaped by the others. 

 

[89] As a
result, it is the voluntariness of the statement itself which must be
established beyond a reasonable doubt, not the individual facts upon which this
conclusion is based.  The Crown may rely on a constellation of facts in order
to prove voluntariness.  As noted in Boudreau, at p. 267, quoted with
approval in Singh, at para. 31: “All the surrounding circumstances must
be investigated and, if upon their review the Court is not satisfied of the
voluntary nature of the admission, the statement will be rejected.”  To be
relied upon as proof of voluntariness, the Crown need not prove each underlying
fact beyond a reasonable doubt as a prerequisite to a finding of voluntariness
itself.

 








[90] This
Court has stated common circumstances that can vitiate the voluntariness of a
confession: threats or promises, oppression, lack of operating mind and other
police trickery (Oickle, at paras. 47‑71).  Evidence of compliance
with the informational and waiver requirements are two factors which are to be
considered and weighed by the judge, together with other relevant factors, in
deciding whether the statement was made voluntarily.  Evaluated in a piecemeal
fashion, they may not allow a judge to conclude whether the statement was
voluntary.  However, in conjunction with all the other relevant circumstances,
they may assist in determining whether a reasonable doubt exists with respect
to the voluntariness of the statement.

 

[91] Accordingly,
even though compliance with the informational and waiver requirements are
factors considered in determining the voluntary nature of the statement, that
does not have the effect of modifying the evidentiary threshold required by
criminal law — namely, that all the evidence, when considered together,
must give rise to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, the enquiry as to
compliance with the statutory preliminary matters in s. 146(2) (b) and
(4) is separate and is to be decided, as other preliminary matters, on a
standard of proof on a balance of probabilities.   

 

(3)    Object and Scheme of Section 146  YCJA 

 

[92] Fish
J. says that proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the informational and  waiver
requirements is the standard most compatible with the object and scheme of
s. 146  read as a whole (Fish J.’s reasons, at para. 6).  I am unable to
agree.  

 








[93] I do
agree that Parliament specifically sought to endow young persons with enhanced
procedural protections in the form of the statutorily based protections in s. 146 
in recognition of the presumption of reduced moral sophistication and maturity
of young persons.  Parliament did not say, however, that the standard of proof
for compliance with the informational and waiver requirements is beyond a
reasonable doubt.  To the contrary, Parliament stated in s. 146(1)  YCJA 
that the common law rule relating to the admissibility of evidence is to apply
— namely, that all preliminary findings of fact relating to the use of
evidence, other than voluntariness, must be determined on the balance of
probabilities.  

 

[94] The
requirements of s. 146  are substantially broader than those under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  A young person must be advised of the
right to silence and warned of the potential use of any statement against him
or her, as well as of the right to consult with counsel and a parent and to
have those persons present while a statement is made (s. 146(2) (b) YCJA ). 
If any of these requirements are not satisfied, the statement will
automatically be inadmissible (s. 146(2)  YCJA ).  In contrast, an adult
only has to be informed of the reason for arrest and the right to retain
counsel (s. 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter ).  Police may
question an adult who has retained counsel in the absence of that legal
adviser, unless the accused asks for counsel to be present. “Police persuasion,
short of denying the suspect the right to choose or depriving him of an
operating mind, does not breach the right to silence” (R. v. Hebert,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 184, and quoted with approval in Singh, at
para. 46).  In the case of young persons, however, any statement made by the
young person is required to be made in the presence of counsel and any other
person requested by the young person, unless the young person desires otherwise
(s. 146(2) (b)(iv) YCJA ).

 








[95] It is
by affording young persons the additional protections expressed in s. 146  YCJA 
that Parliament satisfied its objective of recognizing the reduced
sophistication and maturity of young persons.  There is nothing in the words of
s. 146  that expresses or implies a standard of proof of beyond a reasonable
doubt for preliminary determinations of fact.  To the contrary, s. 146 
explicitly incorporates the applicable common law standard of proof with
respect to the admissibility of evidence, namely, proof on a balance of
probabilities for preliminary findings of fact.

 

(4)   Waiver Requirement

 

[96] With
respect to the waiver requirement, Fish J. says that since the Court has
repeatedly indicated that the standard required for a valid waiver of the  Charter 
right to counsel under s. 10 (b) is high, it must follow that the
standard of proof for a valid waiver under s. 146(4)  YCJA  is “very high”
and therefore one of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (Fish J.’s reasons, at
para. 41).

 

[97] In the
context of waivers of Charter ‑based rights, there is no authority
that equates the term “high” with a standard of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Rather, reference to a high standard refers to the requirement of
clarity of the explanation of the rights being waived, not to a high burden of
proof.  As stated by Lamer J. (as he then was) in Korponay v. Attorney
General of Canada, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, at p. 49, the validity of a waiver
of a procedural right for the holder’s benefit, including a Charter 
right, “is dependent upon it being clear and unequivocal that the person is
waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the
rights the procedure was enacted to protect” (emphasis deleted).  See also Clarkson
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at pp. 394-95.  The use of the term
“high” and “clear and unequivocal” does not however mean proof beyond a
reasonable doubt. 








 

[98] Further,
in the context of waiver of a Charter  right, the well-established
standard is proof on a balance of probabilities (R. v. Askov, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1199, at p. 1229, and R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at p.
998.  See also: R. v. Wills (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 529 (Ont. C.A.), at
p. 546, and R. v. Young (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (Ont. C.A.), at
para. 11).  While these cases considered Charter  rights other than the
right to counsel, it follows that the same standard would apply to waiver of
the right to counsel.  To hold otherwise would create a hierarchy of Charter 
rights contrary to the principle established by this Court in Dagenais v.
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at p. 877.  See also:  M.
(A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at  para. 100, Lavoie v. Canada,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 769, 2002 SCC 23, at para. 51, and Chamberlain v. Surrey
School District No. 36, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, 2002 SCC 86, at para. 126. 
Further, there is also jurisprudence directly recognizing that the standard
applicable for waiver of the right to counsel is one of balance of
probabilities: R. v. Hamelin (2001), 297 A.R. 201, 2001 ABQB 742, at
paras. 69‑72.

 

(5)   Consistency With Common Law                                                 

 








[99] Finally,
Fish J. states that “[a]dopting a single standard of proof for compliance with
each component of s. 146  offers significant advantages over a fragmented
approach.  It is consistent, moreover, with the relevant principles of
statutory interpretation — in particular, the presumption that legislation is
internally consistent and coherent” (para. 47).  Although this approach might
seem at first glance to promote consistency, it in fact generates inconsistency
in the law applicable to the admissibility of evidence as it now stands in
Canada.  As I have endeavoured to show, the common law standard of proof, with
respect to preliminary questions pertaining to the admissibility of evidence,
is proof on the balance of probabilities.  Imposing a reasonable doubt standard
in s. 146(2) (b) and (4)  would create an inconsistency between these
provisions and all other common law preconditions relating to the admissibility
of evidence.  This would be contrary to s. 146(1)  in view of the express
direction in s. 146(1)  that the common law relating to the admissibility
of statements applies to the informational and waiver requirements.  This Court
ought not read in a statutory requirement that Parliament did not include and
that is inconsistent with the necessary implication of other terms Parliament
did use.  

 

III.    Disposition

 

[100]     
For these reasons, I am of the view that the standard of proof for
compliance with the informational and waiver requirements in s. 146  is proof on
a balance of probabilities.

 

[101]     
I agree with Fish J. that the issue of whether a detained youth has
received a clear explanation of his rights pursuant to s. 146(2) (b) YCJA 
and whether he has waived those rights in accordance with s. 146(4)  are
questions of fact.  If a trial court properly considers all the relevant
circumstances, then its finding should only be overturned for “some palpable
and overriding error which affected [the trial judge’s] assessment of the
facts”: Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at p. 279 (emphasis
deleted) (quoting Stein v. The Ship “Kathy K”, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, at
p. 808).

 








[102]     
In the present case, the trial judge expressed “grave concerns” about
whether L.T.H. understood his rights.  Having accepted evidence of a learning
disability, she stated that “[o]ther than an affirmative reply to the questions
‘do you understand?’ there is no other evidence that in fact [L.T.H.] fully and
clearly understood his rights” and “[L.T.H.]’s comment, midway through the
reading of the form, to the effect that he was not going to answer all of the
questions being asked of him, leads me to wonder whether he really understood
the importance of the questions being asked and the answers he was giving”
(paras. 35 and 37).  It would appear from her reasons that, even if she had
properly applied a balance of probabilities standard to compliance by the police
with s. 146 , her findings of non-compliance would not have changed.

 

[103]     
Like Fish J., I would allow the appeal, set aside the order for a new
trial  and restore the acquittal.

 

APPENDIX

 

Youth
Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 

 

146. (1) Subject to this section, the law relating to the
admissibility of statements made by persons accused of committing offences
applies in respect of young persons. 

 

(2)   No oral or written statement made by a young person who is less
than eighteen years old, to a peace officer or to any other person who is, in
law, a person in authority, on the arrest or detention of the young person or
in circumstances where the peace officer or other person has reasonable grounds
for believing that the young person has committed an offence is admissible
against the young person unless 

 

(a)   the
statement was voluntary;

 

(b)   the
person to whom the statement was made has, before the statement was made,
clearly explained to the young person, in language appropriate to his or her
age and understanding, that 

 

(i) the young
person is under no obligation to make a statement,

 








(ii) any
statement made by the young person may be used as evidence in proceedings
against him or her,

 

(iii)     the
young person has the right to consult counsel and a parent or other person in
accordance with paragraph (c), and

 

(iv)     any
statement made by the young person is required to be made in the presence of
counsel and any other person consulted in accordance with paragraph (c),
if any, unless the young person desires otherwise;

 

(c)   the
young person has, before the statement was made, been given a reasonable
opportunity to consult 

 

(i) with
counsel, and

 

(ii) with a
parent or, in the absence of a parent, an adult relative or, in the absence of
a parent and an adult relative, any other appropriate adult chosen by the young
person, as long as that person is not a co‑accused, or under
investigation, in respect of the same offence; and

 

(d)   if
the young person consults a person in accordance with paragraph (c), the
young person has been given a reasonable opportunity to make the statement in
the presence of that person.

 

(3)   The requirements set out in paragraphs (2)(b) to (d)
do not apply in respect of oral statements if they are made spontaneously by
the young person to a peace officer or other person in authority before that
person has had a reasonable opportunity to comply with those requirements. 

 

(4)   A young person may waive the rights under paragraph (2)(c)
or (d) but any such waiver 

 

(a)   must
be recorded on video tape or audio tape; or

 

(b)   must
be in writing and contain a statement signed by the young person that he or she
has been informed of the right being waived.

 

(5)   When a waiver of rights under paragraph (2)(c) or (d)
is not made in accordance with subsection (4) owing to a technical
irregularity, the youth justice court may determine that the waiver is valid if
it is satisfied that the young person was informed of his or her rights, and
voluntarily waived them.

 








(6)   When there has been a technical irregularity in complying with
paragraphs (2)(b) to (d), the youth justice court may admit into
evidence a statement referred to in subsection (2), if satisfied that the
admission of the statement would not bring into disrepute the principle that
young persons are entitled to enhanced procedural protection to ensure that
they are treated fairly and their rights are protected. 

 

(7)   A youth justice court judge may rule inadmissible in any
proceedings under this Act a statement made by the young person in respect of
whom the proceedings are taken if the young person satisfies the judge that the
statement was made under duress imposed by any person who is not, in law, a
person in authority. 

 

(8)   A youth justice court judge may in any proceedings under this Act
rule admissible any statement or waiver by a young person if, at the time of
the making of the statement or waiver, 

 

(a)   the
young person held himself or herself to be eighteen years old or older;

 

(b)   the
person to whom the statement or waiver was made conducted reasonable inquiries
as to the age of the young person and had reasonable grounds for believing that
the young person was eighteen years old or older; and

 

(c)   in
all other circumstances the statement or waiver would otherwise be admissible.

 

(9)   For the purpose of this section, a person
consulted under paragraph (2)(c) is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, deemed not to be a person in authority.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: On 28 July 2004, each of the appellants was convicted by Mr. C. Longley, Magistrate, upon a charge of affray under s.93C of the Crimes Act 1900; and each of them was fined $1,500.00.  
     
      
    3 The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court pursuant to s.52(1) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal & Review) Act 2001, which provides for appeals as of right on grounds involving questions of law. On 25 August 2005, Johnson J dismissed their appeal.  
     
      
    4 The appellants then applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, and their application was heard on the basis that, if leave was granted, the appeal would be determined without further argument. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court granted leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    5 In the early hours of Monday 18 November 2002, the three appellants, who are brothers, together with a Mr. Bensley and three women, attended the Lagoon Bar at the Star City Casino. The charges on which the appellants were convicted arose out of an incident on that occasion involving security officers of the casino, in particular Messrs. Wood, Webb, Bannister, Bracamonte, Heaney and Ogston. The prosecution case was based on oral evidence from a number of witnesses, including the security officers, and a compilation video of the incident. The appellants did not give evidence.  
     
      
    6 The prosecution evidence was to the following effect. Mr. Webb assessed one of the appellants as being intoxicated, and directed him to leave the premises. The two other appellants objected to this, and they screamed at him and racially abused him. Mr. Webb then directed them all to leave, and two of the appellants then further abused him and invited him outside to fight. As the appellants were moving towards the door, one of them said to Mr. Bracamonte “ well move me”, and Mr. Bracamonte pushed him towards the door. Mr. Bracamonte was then pushed hard from behind by another of the appellants, punches were then thrown at him, he was tackled from behind into some tables and chairs, put in a headlock and bitten in the back of the head, and punched and kicked to the head. He was left with bruising of the face, a fractured jaw leading to the removal of two wisdom teeth, scarring on the inside and outside of his mouth, a bite injury to the back of his head and a laceration over his left eye. There was a general fracas involving the three appellants and security officers that lasted about one and a half minutes. Mr. Ogston observed Mr. Bracamonte and one of the appellants hitting a table and land on a stage, with the man landing on top of Mr. Bracamonte. Mr. Ogston tried to pull the person off, but as he did so, he was himself grabbed from behind around his throat. He was not able to breathe and started to lose consciousness. He received scratches around his neck and a black eye. There was also evidence of injuries to Mr. Bannister and Mr. Heaney. 
     
      
    7 The first appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault on Mr. Wood, and affray. The second appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr. Bracamonte, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Bannister, assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Heaney, and affray. The third appellant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr. Ogston, and affray. 
     
      
       
      MAGISTRATE’S DECISION 
      
    8 The Magistrate was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of any of the accused on any of the charges other than affray, because he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the identification of which of the appellants did which of the relevant acts. He gave the following reasons for his findings of guilty on the charge of affray: 
     
      
       
        
        The three defendants are charged, and were charged initially, with the charge of affray, which comes under s.93C of the Crimes Act. And it is not a particularly lengthy section, but a person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of an affray. If two or more persons uses or threatens the unlawful violence it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection 1. For the purposes of this section a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone. No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene, and lastly the affray may be committed in private as well as in public places. Well it seems if that termination does not apply, well – that is whether it is or isn’t in a public place, but for the purposes of the exercise I suppose, it certainly is a public place. 
         
         
        Now firstly in my view there are two or more persons, there are three, in fact there were four. I am dealing with three. And it is their conduct in my view taken collectively which, if viewed in that collective circumstance, would be conduct which would be considered for the purposes of s.93C(1). 
         
         
        One aspect of, of course the submission made by Mr Bellanto in relation to his respective clients, is that they are each of good character. And of course as a matter of law I am required to take that into account in assessing whether they are persons who would be likely to commit this offence. They are each young persons, and from a criminal history point of view, are persons of good character. 
         
         
        Now this event, and I will use that term again, started it is fair to say in my view somewhat innocently, inoffensively, that is the detection of one of the young males, which I believe to be Vincenzo, coming in contact with a security door. He is then, as is required it seems, by the Casino in implementing the Liquor Act Provisions conducted a responsible service of alcohol assessment. They did so, and did so most properly. 
         
         
        Shortly before that assessment took place, and dare I say after the assessment took place by Mr Webb, it was the involvement of three others who then took it upon themselves to question the decision that had been made. Now true it is the video indicates visual only and not audio, but it is very apparent to me in seeing and viewing it, I think I can say repeatedly, that there was significant disquiet from the men in black. And I am using those terms, because at this stage of the proceedings [sic] did not know who they were, apart from the fact that there were three members of the one family. And it is clear that they were not pleased with the decision that had been made. But it seems with the ongoing conversation that whilst reluctant they certainly appeared to accept it. 
         
         
        All of the security which happened to be at that stage Mr Bracamonte, Mr Webb and Mr Wood, having accepted their indication that they were going to leave, moving back in to the Lagoon Bar, and it is obvious that there was a conscious effort on behalf of at least one of the security officers to make sure that they were heading in the right direction, so to speak. Now what flowed from that was an indignation from one of the men in black regarding the speed with which they were required in my view to leave. That indignation resulted in the behaviour of one of them in pushing, for reasons that are not obvious to me, the security officer in the back, and it was a most violent act in my view in those circumstances, unnecessary. So then, as a result of that, the security officer turns around and with more good luck than good management ducks a punch from one of the men in black. So then there is what happens over a very short period of time is an involvement by these three officers, the three men in black, towards Mr Webb and Mr Bracamonte. 
         
         
        Now it has been urged upon me that there has to be a degree of common purpose. I do not see why that needs to be, in my view, an element of this offence. But even if it was it seems to me that the actions of one precipitated the actions of others. Now it was my determination that the identification of particular persons involved in particular acts could not be proved to the requisite standard. It was urged or submitted to me that there was no evidence of implication beyond reasonable doubt. There certainly was evidence that it was not in my view sufficient to satisfy the elements of those individual charges. 
         
         
        The evidence, which is on the tape, and which has been given in evidence by Mr Bracamonte, Mr Webb, is that he, Mr Bracamonte, was kicked, he was punched, unlawful acts. True it is on the available evidence I could not be satisfied to the requisite standard of the individual charge of grievous bodily harm. There was evidence that both pictorially and in a group situation, where Mr Bracamonte had received a bite. There was evidence in relation to Mr Bannister. He enters because he sees what is happening, and he drags off a person, who then in attempting to get out of that hold, uses his hands on the eyes of Mr Bannister. 
         
         
        A male grabs Mr Ogston, puts him in a choke hold. The result from that is that efforts are undertaken by security to release that hold. The result of that is a person, a man in black comes in and starts punching Mr Heaney. 
         
         
        Now it has been urged upon me that amongst other things that the security officers could not be described as persons of reasonable firmness, because that is their job, they are there, and should not be the yard stick, which was the submission that was made. But provisions of the Statute provide that persons do not have to be of reasonable firmness, but he might have to be present. Now it has also been urged upon me that these officers – I withdraw that, these three persons did not apply their minds to the situation at hand. Well on the available evidence to me that is exactly what they did. They applied their minds to the situation. It has also been urged that they were reactive. To me, that is a concerted effort on behalf of the defendants to deflect the blame. Right from minute one they blame them. True it is and I accept this submission that the event was shut down relatively quickly. It has been urged upon me that these two people who were having a stickybeak could be used I suppose whilst .. (not transcribable) .. were not used as a yardstick but certainly they would not be in fear of their safety. It is true to say that most of the actual events of aggression towards the security officers had passed. 
         
         
        It seems to me on the available evidence, whilst I could not be satisfied in the discrete offences as to who acted against any specific officer, in my view I do not have to find that. It is their actions which in my view are unlawful and when taken together, a person, if they were there, in my view would have a significant fear for his or her safety and in my view the evidence which has been given both orally and by way of video evidence does not show to me that these persons were acting in self-defence. I FIND EACH OF THE OFFENCES PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 
        
       
       
      PRIMARY JUDGE’S DECISION 
      
    9 The appeal to the Supreme Court raised a number of grounds, including the ground that the Magistrate erred in law when imposing an onus on the appellants in his consideration of the issue of self-defence. The primary judge set out the statutory provisions concerning self-defence, referred to some authorities including R v. Nguyen (1995) 36 NSWLR 397, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        98 It will be recalled that the Plaintiffs did not give evidence in the present proceedings. Nor did they participate in interviews or give statements to investigating police. Accordingly, there was no version from them before the Court concerning their actions and their state of mind at the time of the relevant incident. Acting Sergeant Buttrose gave evidence that, in general conversation after the incident, one of the men  
        “and I couldn’t tell you which one, was saying they 
         [the security officers] 
         started it” 
         (Transcript, 20 July 2004, T35.35).  
         
         
        99 Mr Bellanto QC submitted that self defence was raised by his cross-examination of Mr Bracamonte (Transcript 22 July 2004, T68.42):  
         
          
          “Q. And thereafter what occurred was really a series of acts where these various men were either defending themselves from violence from you or your colleagues or defending each other, helping each other? 
           
           
          A. That could be a possibility, yes. We get that all the time but. Of course when there’s a group there [sic] always going to be always involved because they don’t want their friend getting asked to leave. Nobody’s intoxicated when we asked them to leave they were all straight, that’s the thing.” 
          
         
        100 Reliance was also placed upon the later cross-examination of Mr Bracamonte (Transcript, 22 July 2004, T89.19):  
         
          
           
            
            “Q. Would you say the way this incident developed was really a sequence of events one man going to the aid of another? 
             
            A. In what way? 
             
             
            Q. Security personnel were going to the aid of security personnel? 
             
            A. Yeah and – yeah each one. 
             
             
            Q. And the men in black were going to the aid of men in black? 
             
            A. Yeah. 
             
             
            Q. In the course of people going to the aid of each other that’s how the whole thing sort of started and how it developed? 
             
            A. No, it already started before everyone arrived. 
             
             
            Q. It really started I suggest in a physical sense when you applied directional movement didn’t it? 
             
            A. No, necessarily, no. 
             
             
            Q. Do you agree with that? 
             
            A. Yeah. 
             
             
            Q. That’s how it really started? 
             
            A. Yeah. But it also started too because their behaviour as well.” 
             
            
           
          
         
        101 The Plaintiffs relied upon the cross-examination of Mr Ogston to the following effect (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T17.6):  
         
          
          “Q. From what you could see it was a case of including the security people and the men in black, it was really a case of those present going to the aid of another. Do you agree with that? Do you understand what I’m saying? The whole thing escalated by one person going to the aid of another person, another person going to the aid of the person who was going to the aid of the first persona [sic] and it was like a chain reaction? 
           
          A. Yeah. 
           
          Q. Do you agree with that? 
           
          A. Yes I do.” 
           
          
         
        102 Mr Bellanto QC relied upon evidence that one or more of the security officers had used  
        “directional force” 
         or  
        “directional movement”  
        towards one of the  
        “men in black” 
         and that this evidence was relevant to the self-defence issue. He complained that the learned Magistrate had not addressed the  
        “directional force” 
         issue in his judgment. His Honour did advert to this part of the evidence in his finding that  
        “it is obvious that there was a conscious effort on behalf of at least one of the security officers to make sure that they were heading in the right direction, so to speak” 
        . Mr Bellanto QC complains that this finding did not have regard in an appropriate way to what he submitted was the significance of the  
        “directional force” 
         evidence in the case.  
         
         
        103 Mr Bellanto QC submitted that the evidence raised self defence, including the defence of others being the other  
        “men in black” 
        . In these circumstances, the Plaintiffs submitted that self defence was raised and was not negatived beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. Further, it was submitted that the learned Magistrate had misdirected himself on the question of self defence so as to constitute an error in law.  
         
         
        104 Mr Lakatos submitted that there was no evidence in the proceedings which gave rise to a consideration of self defence. The assertion was advanced in cross-examination of witnesses but not acceded to by those witnesses. The tenor of the evidence of the security officers so cross-examined was that they had been set upon by the Plaintiffs. The Defendant submitted that this was far removed from any legitimate issue of self defence.  
         
         
        105 Mr Lakatos submitted that the evidence, as it stood, gave no support to the proposition that the Plaintiffs had the belief set out in s.418(2)  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . Absent such material, the prosecution bore no onus of proof at all.  
         
         
        106 Further, Mr Lakatos submitted that his Honour’s concluding comments indicated clearly that this was his view of the evidence. His Honour concluded that  
        “the evidence which has been given both orally and by way of video evidence does not show to me that these persons were acting in self-defence”.  
        It was submitted that self defence had not been raised on the evidence and that the learned Magistrate did not fall into error of law with respect to this question.  
         
         
        107 As cases such as  
        Honeysett  
        and  
        Nguyen 
         make clear, self defence may apply to a charge of affray. However, the issue must be raised in the case. This may occur more readily where a limited number of persons are involved in the fight and, perhaps, self defence is raised by way of explanation or otherwise with respect to the actions of one or more persons. That is not the present case.  
         
         
        108 In considering this ground, I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence, including the video tape. I accept the Defendant’s submissions with respect to this ground. The evidence did not raise self defence in this case. The cross-examination did not adduce evidence which was capable of raising self defence for the purpose of s.418(2) of the Act. I have considered whether the compilation video tape depicts actions which may have raised self defence in the case. In my view, the tape does not contain material which raises self defence. The evidence in this case points to the three Plaintiffs, in the words of Priestley JA in  
        Nguyen 
        , being persons who wanted to fight. In such circumstances, self defence does not arise. 
         
         
        109 I do not consider that the Plaintiffs’ submissions referring to  
        “directional force” 
         demonstrate any error in law on the learned Magistrate’s behalf. Properly understood, this evidence related to the touching of one of the  
        “men in black” 
         to point him in a particular direction. The contact in question is depicted in the video tape. Although this contact formed part of a sequence of events leading to aggressive conduct on the part of the three Plaintiffs it did not, in my view, raise self defence with respect to the aggressive conduct of the Plaintiffs which followed.  
         
         
        110 Although my finding with respect to this ground does not depend upon evidence of injuries sustained during the incident, it is not entirely irrelevant to observe that Mr Bracamonte received a broken jaw and facial bruising and was hospitalised for four days (Transcript, 22 July 2004, T60, 62), Mr Ogston received scratches around his neck and a black eye (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T7.50), Mr Heaney received a cut lip and a cut to the forehead (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T34.6) and Mr Bannister sustained blurred vision and bloodshot eyes as a result of fingers being dug into his eyes (Transcript, 23 July 2004, T53-54). Apart from the reference to Mr Bensley’s shoulder (see paragraph 81 above), there was no evidence that any of the Plaintiffs had sustained injury. In cross-examination of Constable Qui, Mr Bellanto QC asked (Transcript, 20 July 2004, T55.34):  
         
          
          “Q. You notice any of these boys in black in torn clothing? 
           
          A. No I did not. 
           
           
          Q. Did you notice any marks on their body, their lip for example, cut lips, things like that? 
           
          A. No I did not.” 
          
         
         
        111 In my view, the evidence in this case did not raise self defence. No error of law has been demonstrated. I reject Ground 4. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    10 The appellants appeal to this Court on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in law in finding and holding that the evidence did not raise self-defence on the part of the Appellants within the meaning of ss.418-419 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in law in finding and holding that the Appellants were unable to raise self-defence in the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    11 This appeal involves the following provisions of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    12 First, s.93C concerning the crime of affray: 
     
      
       
        
        93C Affray 
         
        (1) A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
        (2) If 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1). 
         
        (3) For the purposes of this section, a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone. 
         
        (4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene. 
         
        (5) Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places. 
        
       
      
    13 Next, ss.418, 419 and 422, concerning self-defence: 
     
      
       
        
        418 Self-defence - when available 
         
        (1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence. 
         
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:  
         
          
          (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
           
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
           
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
           
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, 
           
          and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them. 
          
         
         
        419 Self-defence - onus of proof 
         
        In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence. 
         
         
        422 Self-defence - response to lawful conduct 
         
        This Division is not excluded merely because:  
         
        (a) the conduct to which the person responds is lawful, or 
         
        (b) the other person carrying out the conduct to which the person responds is not criminally responsible for it. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    14 Mr. Jackson QC for the appellant submitted that plainly this was not a case of premeditated attack by the appellants, and that there was clear evidence of each of the appellants going to the aid of each other either to prevent themselves being deprived of their liberty or to prevent others being deprived of their liberty, or to defend themselves or to defend the others, within s.418(1)(a) and (b); and that this was supported by the evidence referred to by the primary judge, particularly the evidence of Mr. Ogston in par.[101] of the primary judge’s judgment. Self-defence is not excluded merely because the conduct to which an accused is responding is lawful: see s.422.  
     
      
    15 He submitted that, if there was evidence raising self-defence in relation to just one of the accused, then, because of the identification problem which resulted in dismissal of the other charges, this would be sufficient to raise self-defence in relation to all of them.  
     
      
    16 Mr. Jackson submitted that all that was needed to raise self-defence was evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of a jury: Zecevic v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 665; Douglas v. R [2005] NSWCCA 419 at [84]-[100]; R v. Duncan [2006] QCA 46 at [2], [11], [31]-[34]. Accordingly, the primary judge was in error in finding that the evidence did not raise self-defence.  
     
      
    17 To the extent that the primary judge relied on the words of Priestley JA in Nguyen at 412 to the effect that self-defence did not arise in the case of a person who wanted a fight, Mr. Jackson submitted that this was an error because these words concerned the common law position, whereas here the question was whether the statutory words applied, and in relation to those words the concept of “wanting to fight” had no application; and in any event, he submitted, the Magistrate had not made findings of fact to the effect that each of the appellants wanted to fight.  
     
      
    18 Mr. Jackson submitted that the Magistrate was in error in the way he dealt with self-defence. If what he said was interpreted as meaning that the evidence was insufficient to raise the issue of self-defence for consideration, he was in error for the same reasons as the primary judge; and if this was interpreted as a finding that the defence was not made out, he was in error in reversing the onus of proof.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    19 In my opinion, the following principles are applicable in this case.  
     
      
       
      (1) By reason of the onus of proof provided by s.419, all that is needed to raise self-defence is evidence capable of supporting a reasonable doubt in the mind of the tribunal of fact as to whether the prosecution has excluded self-defence. Thus, in relation to s.418(1)(a), there needs to be evidence capable of indicating a reasonable possibility of a belief by the accused that the conduct constituting the offence was necessary to defend himself or herself or others, and of a perception of circumstances such that the accused’s response was reasonable. However, the evidence must be capable of doing this as a matter of legitimate reasoning and not mere speculation: to that extent, I agree with  
      R v. Imadonmwonyi 
       [2004] VSC 361 at [21] and  
      R v. Mekic 
       [2004] SASC 44 at [5]. 
       
       
      (2) It is not essential that there be evidence from the accused as to the accused’s beliefs and perceptions: evidence of circumstances from which inferences may be drawn as to the accused’s relevant beliefs and perceptions may be sufficient. However, if the accused does not give evidence of his or her beliefs and perceptions, then generally, in the absence of other evidence suggesting the contrary, inferences have to be drawn on the basis of what beliefs and perceptions a person in the position of the accused could reasonably hold in the circumstances.  
       
       
      (3) The defence may succeed even though the conduct to which the accused responds is lawful (s.422); but if this conduct is lawful, then this is relevant to whether the accused could have believed it was conduct in respect of which defence was necessary, or which threatened an unlawful deprivation of liberty; and relevant also to whether the accused’s conduct could have been a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them. 
       
       
      (4) A finding that an accused “wanted to fight” does not of itself exclude self-defence; but is relevant to whether the accused could have believed his or her conduct to be necessary for defence or to prevent unlawful deprivation of liberty. Furthermore, if a person believes that any risk of harm can be dealt with by withdrawing, then generally that belief would be inconsistent with a belief that conduct of the nature of an assault was necessary for defence. The following discussion by Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ in  
      Zecevic 
       at 663-4 is relevant: 
       
        
         
          
          Where an accused person raising a plea of self-defence was the original aggressor and induced or provoked the assault against which he claims the right to defend himself, it will be for the jury to consider whether the original aggression had ceased so as to have enabled the accused to form a belief, upon reasonable grounds, that his actions were necessary in self-defence. For this purpose, it will be relevant to consider the extent to which the accused declined further conflict and quit the use of force or retreated from it, these being matters which may bear upon the nature of the occasion and the use which the accused made of it. Indeed, even in circumstances in which the accused was not the original aggressor, retreat in the face of a threat of violence before resort to force may be relevant to the belief of the accused or the reasonableness of the grounds upon which the accused based his belief. There is, however, no longer any rule that the accused must have retreated as far as possible before attempting to defend himself. It is a circumstance to be considered with all the others in determining whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that what he did was necessary in self-defence:  
          Reg. v. Howe,  
          per Dixon C.J. (1958) 100 CLR at 462-4;  
          Viro v The Queen,  
          per Gibbs J. (1978) 141 CLR at 115-6. 
           
           
          … 
           
           
          The whole of the surrounding circumstances are to be taken into account and where an accused person has created the situation in which force might lawfully be applied to apprehend him or cause him to desist - where, e.g., he is engaged in criminal behaviour of a violent kind - then the only reasonable view of his resistance to that force will be that he is acting, not in self-defence, but as an aggressor in pursuit of his original design. A person may not create a continuing situation of emergency and provoke a lawful attack upon himself and yet claim upon reasonable grounds the right to defend himself against that attack. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This discussion was directed to self-defence at common law, not under s.418; but similar reasoning applies in relation to s.418.  
        
       
       
      (5) However, in this case, because of the identification problems, if self-defence is raised in relation to any one of the appellants, it is raised in relation to all of them; and if self-defence is not excluded beyond reasonable doubt in relation to any one of the appellants, it is not excluded in relation to all of them.  
       
      
    20 There was no evidence from the appellants as to their beliefs or perceptions; so the question is, what inferences could be drawn as to their possible beliefs and perceptions from objective circumstances of which there was evidence in this case. In my opinion, the following factors are relevant: 
     
      
       
      (1) All of the appellants were lawfully requested to leave, and thereafter the security officers could lawfully use reasonable force to bring this about.  
       
       
      (2) There is no evidence of conduct of any of the security officers, prior to the fracas, going beyond conduct directed at causing the appellants to leave: in particular, there was no evidence of any attack on the appellants, or any of them, which could be seen as involving any risk of harm to the appellants or any of them. 
       
       
      (3) Even if the initial push by one of the security officers was not strictly necessary to cause the appellants to leave, and even if it constituted a technical assault, it was not such as could give rise to a belief that could be reasonably held that the person pushed was being attacked or was in any risk of harm or in any need of defence by himself or others: plainly, all he was being required to do was to leave the premises as he was lawfully obliged to do.  
       
       
      (4) The violent push and attempted blows against this security officer that followed immediately from at least one appellant could not reasonably have been believed to be necessary in defence of any of the appellants.  
       
       
      (5) There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the resort to violence by the other appellants was preceded by any actions by security officers that were, or appeared to be, other than to promote the departure of the appellants and/or to defend themselves or others. So far as the evidence went, the actions of security officers were not such as could give rise to a belief that could be reasonably held that any of the appellants were in need of defence by himself or others; that is, that any appellant had to do any more than stop fighting in order to eliminate any risk of harm against which defence was necessary. That this was so is confirmed by the circumstance that none of the appellants was observed to have received any significant injury, while one of the security guards received very serious injuries and others of them received significant injuries. 
       
      
    21 In those circumstances, in my opinion the evidence relied on by Mr. Jackson was not sufficient to raise self-defence.  
     
      
    22 The assertion by one of the appellants to a police officer that the security officers “started it” could not, in the circumstances of this case, suggest a belief that the security officers “started it” in any sense relevant to self-defence: all the evidence was to the effect that violence was initiated by one of the appellants, in circumstances where there was no risk of harm being visited upon any of the appellants. A belief that the security officers started it, in the sense that they or one of them did something that could make defence of oneself or others necessary, could not be inferred as something reasonably possible in the objective circumstances; so in the absence of evidence from the appellants, there was no evidentiary basis for a view that such a belief was reasonably possible.  
     
      
    23 The evidence about the incident being a series of events in which each of the appellants was going to the aid of other appellants similarly does not raise self-defence, where the objective circumstances were such that a person in the position of any of the appellants could not reasonably believe that violent action was necessary as a matter of defence to prevent harm being done to any of the appellants or to prevent unlawful deprivation of liberty: on the evidence, all the security officers were doing, prior to the resort to violence by all the appellants, was initially to seek the lawful removal of the appellants from the premises, and thereafter to defend themselves or others. And once all the appellants had resorted to violence, they were all guilty of affray. 
     
      
    24 In the circumstances of this case, for the appellants to have an evidentiary basis for a reasonable doubt about their beliefs as to what was necessary, and as to their perceptions of circumstances in which their responses may have been reasonable, some evidence would have been required from them as to their actual beliefs and perceptions. In the absence of such evidence, the defence of self-defence generally depends upon what beliefs and perceptions of persons in the position of the accused persons may reasonably have had, having regard to objective circumstances of which there was evidence; and for the reasons I have given, the objective circumstances of which there was evidence in this case did not support a reasonable possibility of the existence of relevant beliefs and/or perceptions. 
     
      
    25 For those reasons, in my opinion the primary judge was correct in holding that the evidence did not raise self-defence; and similarly, no relevant error is shown in the decision of the Magistrate. 
     
      
    26 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    27 IPP JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

Criminal law — Sentencing — Dangerous offenders and
long‑term offenders — Accused declared to be dangerous offender and
sentenced to indeterminate prison term — Predicate offence occurring  prior to
enactment in Criminal Code of long‑term offender provisions — Whether
sentencing judge’s conclusion that long‑term offender provisions not
available to person who satisfies dangerous offender criteria constituted error

759(3) (b) — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 11 (i).

 

In February 2000, the accused was found to be a
dangerous offender and was sentenced to an indeterminate period of
imprisonment.  The predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment
in the Criminal Code  of the long‑term offender provisions. 
The sentencing judge held that these provisions were not available to a person
who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
accused’s appeal and ordered a new sentencing hearing.

 

Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

For the reasons set out in R. v. Johnson,
[2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, 2003 SCC 46, the sentencing judge was required to consider
the possibility of a long‑term offender designation prior to declaring
the accused a dangerous offender, even though the predicate offence was
committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the long‑term offender
provisions.  In the absence of a full inquiry into the suitability of a
long‑term offender designation, it would be improper to reinstate the
sentencing judge’s finding that the accused  is properly classified as a
dangerous offender.

1                                  
Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. — This
case, which was heard at the same time as R. v. Johnson, [2003] 2 S.C.R.
357, 2003 SCC 46, R. v. Edgar, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 388, 2003 SCC 47, R.
v. Mitchell, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 396, 2003 SCC 49, and R. v. Kelly,
[2003] 2 S.C.R. 400, 2003 SCC 50, involves an appeal against a sentencing
judge’s decision to declare an offender dangerous and sentence him to an
indeterminate period of detention.  As in Johnson, Edgar and Mitchell,
the predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the
long-term offender provisions in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46 .  The question that this appeal raises is whether the sentencing judge’s
conclusion that the long-term offender provisions are not available to a person
who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria constituted an error of law.

 

2                                  
For the reasons set out in Johnson, the
sentencing judge was required to consider the possibility of a long-term
offender designation prior to declaring the offender dangerous, even though the
predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the long-term
offender provisions.  If an offender satisfies the criteria set out in the
long-term offender provisions and the sentencing judge is satisfied that a
determinate sentence followed by a long-term supervision order would reduce the
threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other
persons to an acceptable level, the sentencing judge cannot properly declare
the offender dangerous and thereupon impose an indeterminate sentence. 

 

3                                  
In this case, the record discloses insufficient
evidence to conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the
respondent would have been declared a long-term offender if the sentencing
judge had concluded that the long-term offender provisions were available. 
Having concluded that the long-term offender provisions are not available to a
person who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria, the sentencing judge did
not conduct a full inquiry into the suitability of a long-term offender
designation.  Absent such an inquiry, it would be improper to reinstate the
sentencing judge’s finding that the respondent is properly classified as a
dangerous offender.

 








4                                  
In the result, the appeal is dismissed.  We confirm the Court of
Appeal’s decision to order a new sentencing hearing, to be determined in
accordance with the principles set out in Johnson.

 

Appeal dismissed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

background

1                    
This is an application pursuant to s 39B of
the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), and s 5(1) of the Administrative
Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) to review a decision of a Deputy
President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) made on
10 July 2003.  By that decision, the
Tribunal affirmed a decision made by the respondent Minister on 28 January
2000 that the applicant should be deported, pursuant to s 200 of the Migration
Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”).  

2                    
The applicant was born in Vietnam in 1971.  In 1989, he fled that country, together with
his sister.  He arrived in Australia in
1990 having been granted a visa under a special humanitarian program.  At no stage did he become a citizen of this
country. 

3                    
In November 1995, the applicant’s mother
migrated to Australia.  He has two
brothers, with whom he maintains contact, who reside in the United States.  He has lost contact with another brother who
resides in Vietnam.  His sister continues
to reside in Australia.  

4                    
Between 1994 and 1997, the applicant was convicted
of a number of criminal offences.  These
included various drug offences, and theft. 
On 6 November 1997, he became involved in a domestic argument with
his sister’s de facto husband.  The
applicant stabbed him three times with a cleaver, resulting in the infliction
of serious injuries to his head and upper body. 
Initially, the applicant was charged with attempted murder.  Eventually, he pleaded guilty to one count of
intentionally causing serious injury pursuant to s 16 of the Crimes Act
1958 (Vic).  On 3 July 1998, he was
sentenced in the County Court of Victoria to a term of three years’
imprisonment, of which two years were suspended.  In addition, on 26 March 1998, he
pleaded guilty in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court to various charges including
trafficking and using heroin, and was sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment, wholly suspended.  

5                    
Judge McInerney, who dealt with the
applicant on the count of intentionally causing serious injury, made the
following sentencing remarks:

“Mr Tran has pleaded guilty to one count of causing serious
injury intentionally, contrary to s 16 of the Crimes Act, the maximum
penalty for which offence is a period of 20 years.



The circumstances of this offence, unfortunately, [are] all too
common and also all too simple.  There
was a domestic argument within the home between Mr Tran and his
brother-in-law.  The end result of that
is that, under the pressure of that argument, Mr Tran utilized what,
essentially, can be described as a cleaver, to assault upon his brother-in-law,
to the extent that he almost opened up his brother-in-law’s upper body.  One only needs to look at the photographs in
Exhibit A as to the consequences to see the dimension of this injury.  Suffice to say that his brother-in-law was
taken in a critical condition to the Western Hospital, where he was on the
intensive list for a period of five days. 
Fortunately, he has made an adequate recovery but, perhaps, even more
fortunately for Mr Tran, he did not die.



…



As I say, coming back to the circumstances themselves, they
happened within the domestic environment. 
While a meal was being prepared, as a result of an argument, no doubt, I
accept that there was some form or provocation, not legal provocation, but some
domestic issues between Mr Tran and his brother-in-law, but, of course,
those matters were not put in any way by Mr Arden as being any excuse for
these offences.



Mr Tran is 26.  He is
a person with no priors.  He has no
violence at all in his antecedents, and he has been particularly
co-operative.  I accept his evidence that
he had regret for his actions, and has expressed remorse for his actions.  There was, in the plea, no dispute that a
period of imprisonment was called for, given the serious nature of the offence.  



…



Taking all of those matters into account, as a result of those
particular reports, I have determined, unfortunately, that, even with that
background, the circumstances of this offence, its intensity and its
seriousness is such that there is no alternative but for a period of immediate
imprisonment to be imposed.  I have
determined that the appropriate period of imprisonment that should be imposed
is a period of three years.  However,
taking into account all of the matters that have been put to me, in particular,
the reports, I have determined to suspend two years of that period of
imprisonment, pursuant to provisions of s 27 of the Sentencing Act 1991.”



6                    
The applicant claimed before the Tribunal that
the offence had occurred during an argument between himself and the victim, and
in response to the victim having struck him on the leg with a piece of
wood.  The applicant claimed that the leg
upon which he was struck had been permanently disfigured during a motorcar
accident a few years earlier.  The
applicant also claimed that the victim had called him a “cripple”.  

7                    
There was also material before the Tribunal to
show that in August 2000 and March 2001, the applicant was sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court to an Intensive Corrections Order and two further short
terms of imprisonment in relation to various drug charges.  

8                    
On 18 October 1999, a delegate of the
respondent interviewed the applicant in relation to the offence for which Judge
McInerney had imprisoned him in the previous year.  On 28 January 2000, the then Minister
decided that the applicant was a person who came within the ambit of s 201
of the Act, and that he should be deported under s 200.  At that stage, the Minister caused a
certificate to be issued under s 502, stating that it was in the national
interest that the applicant be declared an “excluded person”.  Subsequently, that certificate was withdrawn,
thereby enabling the applicant to seek merits review of the decision in the
Tribunal.  

legislative scheme

9                    
Section 200 of the Act provides as follows:

“The Minister may order the deportation of a non-citizen to whom
this Division applies.”



10                 
It has been recognised that the discretion of
the Minister under this section is very broad. 
By virtue of s 201, s 200 applies to non-citizens who have
been in Australia for less than 10 years, and who have been convicted of
particular offences.  The section
provides:

“Where:

 

(a)       a person who is a non-citizen has, either
before or after the commencement of this section, been convicted in Australia
of an offence; 



(b)       when the offence
was committed the person was a non-citizen who: 

(i)      had been in Australia as a permanent
resident: 

(A)     for a period of less than 10 years; or 

(B)     for periods that, when added together,
total less than 10 years; or 

…

(c)       the offence is an offence for which the
person was sentenced to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of
not less than one year; 



section 200 applies to the person.”



11                 
Section 499(1) provides that the Minister may
give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under
the Act about the performance of those functions, or the exercise of those
powers.  The Minister is required to
cause a copy of any direction given under that subsection to be laid before
each House of the Parliament.  The
Minister had given such a direction in relation to the deportation of
non-citizens under s 200.  That
direction is described as “General Direction – Criminal Deportation – No.
9”.  Section 499(2A) provides that
“a person or body must comply with” a direction under s 499(1). 

12                 
The direction relevantly provides:

“1.       This General
Direction may be cited as General Direction – Criminal Deportation –
No. 9.



2.                
Deportation decisions are made without any form of
discrimination with respect to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political
or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.



3.         A person’s
cultural background should not result in differing applications of the
law.  While our multicultural society
encourages all persons to practise their cultures and pursue their ideals, this
practice should fall within a respect for and adherence to the laws of
Australia.  Contrary cultural values
should not provide any excuse to persons who offend against Australian society.



4.         The
purpose of deporting a person from Australia is to protect the safety and
welfare of the Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of the
Australian community as a whole as to who should be allowed to remain in the
community.



PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS



5.                 
The Government is mindful of the need to balance a
number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to deport a
potential deportee.  In making such a
decision, a decision maker should have regard to two primary considerations and
a number of other considerations.  The
primary considerations are set out at paragraph six (6), and two other common
considerations are set out in paragraph seven (7).  A decision maker should have due regard to
the importance placed by the Government on the two primary considerations, but
should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant
considerations.



6.                 
In making a decision whether or not to deport a
non-citizen, there are two primary considerations:



(a)              
the expectations of the Australian community (9); and 

(b)              
in all cases involving a parental relationship between
a child or children and the potential deportee, the best interests of the child
(10) or children.



7.                 
In addition, there will be other considerations that
will be relevant in individual cases. 
Two of the most common are:



(a)              
the degree of hardship (11) which may reasonably be
expected to be suffered by the potential deportee; and 

(b)              
the degree of hardship to Australian citizens or
permanent residents (12) that would reasonably be expected to flow from the
deportation.



COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS

 

8.                 
It is the Government’s view that the expectations of
the Australian community are a primary consideration in determining whether a
potential deportee should be deported. 
Decision makers should have due regard to the Government’s view in this
respect.  There are two aspects to
community expectations:



(a)              
the expectation that the community will e protected and
not put at risk;



            and




(b)              
the expectation that non-citizens who commit/are
convicted of crimes that are abhorrent to the Australian community will be
removed from Australia.



Protection of the Australian Community



9.                 
It is the Government’s view that the Australian
community expects the Government to protect it from the actions of criminals
and to take action to remove unacceptable levels of risk of crime.  In particular, it is the Government’s view
that the Australian community expects that the Government will take necessary
action to ensure the safety of the more vulnerable members of the
community.  The Government considers that
children and young people are especially at risk in this area.  The Government acknowledges that it had a
heavy responsibility to ensure that the rights of the community are carefully
considered when making decisions relating to the criminal deportation of
offenders.  This is of particular
importance when the offences in question are in relation to drugs and crimes of
violence.  A decision maker should have
due regard to the Government’s views in this respect.



10.             
It is the Government’s view that the following factors
are relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community and the
need for its protection:



(a)              
the seriousness and nature of the crime;

(b)              
the risk of recidivism; and 

(c)               
the likelihood that deportation of the potential
deportee would be likely to prevent or discourage similar offences by other
persons.



Decision makes should have due regard to the Government’s view
in this respect.”



13                 
The General Direction goes on to provide
detailed guidelines for the consideration of each of the three factors set out
in par 10.  Relevantly, it includes
among examples of offences that are considered by the Government to be “very
serious” the crimes of “murder, manslaughter, assault or any other form of
violence against persons”.  

14                 
The General Direction also sets out at
par 21 two other matters that, though not primary considerations, are
relevant.  These are described as “other
considerations”, to be taken into account, but given less weight than the
primary considerations.  They are:

“(a)     the degree of hardship which may be
suffered by the potential deportee; and



(b)       the degree of hardship to any Australian
citizens or permanent residents, including the potential deportee’s family (15)
(other than children whose best interests are a primary consideration.”



the tribunal’s decision

15                 
The Tribunal concluded that the respondent’s
decision of 28 January 2000, ordering the applicant’s deportation, should
be affirmed.  It said:

“2.       The reason for
the Tribunal's decision is that the seriousness and the nature of the offence
for which Mr Tran is to be deported outweigh all of the other considerations
which are relevant for the Tribunal to take into account in considering Mr
Tran’s application.” 



16                 
After summarising the background to the
Minister’s decision, the Tribunal set out at [10] the sentencing remarks of
Judge McInerney.  It continued:

“11.     In exercising its
unfettered discretion under s 200 of the Act as to whether to order a
person’s deportation, the Tribunal is bound to have regard to the Minister’s
General Direction - Criminal Deportation - No. 9. 



12.       Under that
Direction, the degree of hardship which may be caused to the potential deportee
or to Australian citizens who are members of the potential deportee’s family
are two relevant “other considerations” which must be balanced against two
“primary considerations”, namely the expectations of the Australian community
and the best interests of any child. 



13.       The first of the
two “primary considerations” is comprised of two aspects, namely: 



(a)     the expectation that the Australian
community will be protected and not put at risk; 



(b)     the expectation that non-citizens who commit
or are convicted of crimes that are abhorrent to the Australian community will
be removed from Australia. 



14.       Further, pursuant
to the Direction, the following factors are relevant to an assessment of the
level of risk to the community and the need for its protection: 



(c)     the seriousness and nature of the crimes;
and 



(d)     the risk of recidivism; and 



(e)     the likelihood that deportation of the
potential deportee would be likely to prevent or discourage similar offences by
other persons. 



15.       While Mr Tran’s
deportable offence, namely causing serious injury intentionally was committed
in circumstances of some provocation, although as observed by McInerney J [sic] in passing
sentence, “not legal provocation”, it is clear that the offence is a very
serious one.  The penalty of 3 years
imprisonment, albeit with 2 years suspended upon conditions, reflects that
fact.  Additionally, under the Direction
it is the Government’s view that assaults or any other form of violence against
persons is considered by the Government to be very serious. 



16.       As to the risk of
recidivism, the Tribunal notes that one of the reports referred to by McInerney
J [sic] in
his comments upon passing sentence set out above was a psychiatric report which
concluded that there was no evidence of any mental illness on the part of Mr
Tran, and that there was a strong likelihood of his being able to successfully
refrain from further violent offending in the future if he could be given the
opportunity to address his substance abuse and his lack of vocational
skills.  Given that evidence before the
Tribunal is suggestive of Mr Tran overcoming his heroin addiction, the Tribunal
does not place undue weight on the risk of recidivism, however the violence
involved in the disproportionate attack by Mr Tran in response to his
brother-in-law’s taunts was deliberate and extreme and absent any psychiatric
illness or disorder one could not have complete confidence that Mr Tran's
capacity in this regard would not again manifest itself given similar
circumstances. 



17.       As to deterrence,
in general terms, no doubt Mr Tran’s deportation would likely have an effect on
non-citizens in Australia with respect to the commission of crimes of violence.




18.       As to the best
interests of any child under the age of 18 who is in a close relationship with
the potential deportee, it is suggested on behalf of Mr Tran that he has a
very strong bond with his sister’s 9 year old son, Andrew Tho.  The Tribunal does not accept this suggestion,
in view of the extensive periods of Mr Tran's incarceration since being
sentenced on 3 July 1998. 



19.       The other
important consideration which must be weighed into the balancing which is
involved in the exercise of the Tribunal’s discretion is the hardship to Mr
Tran and the members of his family which might be brought about as a result of
his deportation. 



20.       As the Tribunal
has already noted, Mr Tran was born in Saigon on 30 June 1971.  His family suffered great hardship by reason
of the war in that country, and Mr Tran fled there with his sister in
1989.  They arrived in Australia on
23 June 1990 after spending time in Malaysia, (having arrived there after two
days at sea).  Mr Tran’s mother did not
come to Australia until November 1995. 
She left behind her one son, two years Mr Tran’s senior, who still
resides in Vietnam and another two sons, who reside in the United States of
America. 



21.       Mr Tran’s mother
is now 68 years old, and her husband having passed away many years ago,
her life and her happiness centres upon being able to be near her daughter, her
son (Mr Tran) and her grandchildren. 
She has become depressed and has experienced feelings of helplessness as
a result of Mr Tran being imprisoned and permanent separation from him, which
is the almost inevitable consequence of deportation, would bring great sadness
to her.  She finds the prospect of her
son being deported to Vietnam terrifying. 



22.       Mr Tran
himself left Vietnam some thirteen years ago, and has not returned there
since.  He does not know where his
brother is in Vietnam.  He has no assets
and few skills, apart from limited work experience as a sewing machinist and
his prospects in Vietnam must be regarded as poor. 



23.       After anxious
consideration of all matters relevant to the exercise of its discretion in this
case, the Tribunal concludes that the expectation of the Australian community
that it will be protected and not be put at risk, given the seriousness and
nature of Mr Tran’s crime, outweighs the considerations of hardship to him
and his mother as a result of his family in Australia being separated for a
second time. 



24.       Accordingly the
formal order of the Tribunal is that the decision of the respondent’s delegate
of 28 January 2000 pursuant to s 200 of the Migration Act 1958 to deport the
applicant from Australia on the basis of his conviction for intentionally
causing injury on 3 July 1998 is affirmed.” 



the applicant’s contentions

17                 
Mr Krohn, who appeared on behalf of the
applicant, abandoned the grounds set out in the application for review, save
two.  First, he submitted that the
Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by failing to take into account a
relevant consideration, being one that it was bound to take into account,
namely whether the applicant posed an “unacceptable” risk to the
community.  

18                 
He referred to par 8 of the General
Direction in which it is stated that the expectations of the Australia
community are a primary consideration in determining whether a potential
deportee should be deported.  As noted
earlier, that paragraph states that there are two aspects to community
expectations.  These are the expectation
that the community will be protected and not put at risk, and the expectation
that non-citizens who are convicted of crimes that are abhorrent to the
community will be removed from Australia. 


19                 
Mr Krohn then referred to the three
factors, set out at par 10, said to be relevant to an assessment of the
level of risk to the community and the need for its protection.  The first of those is “the seriousness and
nature of the crime”.

20                 
Mr Krohn next referred to [10] of the
Tribunal’s reasons, in which it set out Judge McInerney’s sentencing
remarks.  He noted that the Tribunal had
underlined a number of the remarks that dealt with the seriousness of the
crime, but had not attached a similar emphasis to the applicant’s expressions
of remorse.  He argued that, therefore,
the Tribunal had failed to have regard to a matter that it was required to
consider, namely whether the applicant posed an unacceptable risk to the
community, and instead had focussed in “an overwhelming way” on the seriousness
and nature of the crime.  

21                 
Mr Krohn next submitted that the Tribunal
erred by failing to take into account a series of specific matters, two of
which he said had been singled out for “special mention” by Judge
McInerney.  These were the finding that
the applicant had expressed remorse for his crime, and the evidence that went
to the relationship between the applicant and his mother.  Mr Krohn submitted that when the
Tribunal was considering the community’s expectations, it was bound to take
into account the applicant’s expressions of remorse.  In relation to the applicant’s mother,
Mr Krohn acknowledged that the Tribunal had referred to the hardship that
she had experienced during her son’s imprisonment.  He submitted, however, that the Tribunal had
failed to deal with material that had been before it concerning the
relationship between mother and son.  

the respondent’s contentions

22                 
In relation to the first ground, Ms Moore,
on behalf of the respondent, acknowledged that the Tribunal had placed more
emphasis on the seriousness and nature of the crime than it had on the other
two factors set out in par 10 of the General Direction, namely the risk of
recidivism, and the need for deterrence. 
However, these were matters for the Tribunal.  It was entitled to accord them such weight as
it thought fit.  

23                 
Ms Moore noted that par 9 of the General
Direction stated that the Government’s “heavy responsibility” to consider the
“rights of the community” was of particular importance when dealing with
“crimes of violence”.  In light of that
statement, it made sense that the Tribunal should place the emphasis it did on
the seriousness and nature of the crime committed by the applicant.  

24                 
Ms Moore contended that, in any event, the
Tribunal had adopted the correct balancing process to the overall question of
whether the applicant posed an unacceptable risk to the community.  It had specifically considered evidence
relating to the likelihood that he might overcome his heroin addiction.  She submitted that it had weighed that material
against the specific circumstances of the deportable offence.  It had concluded that it could not have
complete confidence that the applicant would not re-offend, in similar
circumstances.  She submitted that the
Tribunal’s reasons in relation to that conclusion had addressed the issue of
“unacceptable level of risk of crime”.  

25                 
In relation to the second ground, Ms Moore
submitted that the applicant’s complaint was, in effect, a disagreement with
the Tribunal’s process of reasoning on issues of fact.  She argued that the applicant had impermissibly
invited the Court to engage in merits review. 
The Tribunal’s decision could not be set aside even if its process of
logic and reasoning did not commend itself to the Court.  

consideration

26                 
In my view, there is no substance in the first
ground of review.  Although the Tribunal
did not use the word “unacceptable” in referring to the level of risk that the
applicant posed to the community, I am satisfied that it did focus sufficiently
upon that issue.  It concluded at [16] of
its reasons for decision that undue weight should not be placed on the risk
that the applicant would re-offend. 
Nonetheless, it noted that one could not have “complete confidence” that
the applicant would not again respond by the use of disproportionate violence
if provoked by the conduct of another. 
That finding was plainly open on the evidence and, in my opinion,
adequately addressed the overall issue of whether the applicant posed an
unacceptable risk to the community.  

27                 
I am also unable to accept Mr Krohn’s
contentions in relation to the second ground. 
There is no doubt that the Tribunal was aware of the fact that Judge
McInerney had found that the applicant was remorseful.  That conclusion was set out in the extract
from his Honour’s sentencing remarks contained at [10] of the Tribunal’s
reasons.  The weight to be accorded to
that factor was a matter for the Tribunal. 


28                 
Similarly, I consider that the Tribunal
adequately addressed the relationship between the applicant and his mother at
[21] of its reasons.  In a matter in
which an applicant seeks a particular type of visa, the Tribunal is required to
deal with all integers of an applicant’s claim. 
It is not required to refer to every piece of evidence placed before
it.  See generally Paul v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 113 FCR 396 at [79], Htun v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194
ALR 244, and VTAG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 447. 
Although the applicant in the present case does not seek a visa, and is
simply resisting deportation, an analogous principle may be said to apply.

29                 
It follows that the application must be
dismissed.  The applicant must pay the
respondent’s costs.

The following written reasons for judgment were published:—



               Aug. 8
               Barwick C.J.
               
This applicant for special leave to appeal was convicted on indictment of armed robbery by the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Wallace J.) on 12th March 1976. He was represented by counsel in the proceedings in which he pleaded not guilty and which resulted in a verdict of guilty. On his conviction on that verdict, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven and a half years with a non parole period of four and a half years. By the time this Court delivered judgment on his application for special leave on 8th May 1979, he had served just over three years in prison and may possibly have become entitled to some remission of his sentence for good behaviour.
               
The ground upon which the applicant seeks special leave is that, in the proceedings upon his indictment, he was denied the benefit of a peremptory challenge duly made by him to a person called as a juror to try him. For that reason, he claims that he was not tried according to law and that the proceedings, the verdict and his conviction were void and his sentence unauthorized by law.
               
From his conviction the applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia upon grounds other than the ground now put forward for the grant of special leave. He was represented in that appeal by the same counsel as had appeared for him at his trial. His appeal was dismissed.
               
Subsequently, he presented to the Governor of Western Australia a petition for mercy upon the ground now taken on this application: see s. 21 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia (""the Code""). His petition was refused, it being said that his petition showed no ground warranting its grant.
               
Later, the applicant presented to the Governor a further petition upon the same ground but with the added ground of the discovery of fresh evidence bearing upon the issues arising in the proceedings. This petition was also rejected, it being said again that it showed no ground warranting its grant.
               
Undeterred by these setbacks, the applicant moved the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus directed to his gaoler upon the ground that, for the reason already expressed, the verdict and conviction were void and that the warrant of commitment issued upon his conviction constituted no justification for his imprisonment. The Supreme Court, correctly as I think, dismissed his motion, holding that the warrant did justify his imprisonment. The Court had no need to pass upon the regularity of the proceedings upon his indictment; and consequently did not do so.
               
Upon hearing his counsel in support of his application for special leave to appeal and counsel for the Crown in opposition thereto, the Court granted special leave to appeal, treated the argument before it as argument of the appeal, allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and ordered a trial upon the indictment. The Court indicated that the applicant was at liberty to apply to a judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia for bail and stated that it would in due course publish its reasons for making these orders.
               
The applicant, as I have indicated, pleaded not guilty upon his arraignment. Section 622 of the Code provides in such a case that the accused is ""by such plea, without any further form, deemed to have demanded that the issues raised by such plea  shall be tried by a jury and is entitled to have them tried accordingly"".
               
Section 626 of the Code provides:When an accused person has demanded to be tried by a jury, the proper officer of the Court is to inform him in open Court that the persons whose names are to be called are the jurors to be sworn for his trial, and is further to inform him that if he desires to challenge any of them he must do so before they are sworn.
               

               
Section 628, in providing for challenges to the qualifications of a juror or for cause, expressly preserves the right of peremptory challenge.
               
Section 30 of the Juries Act, 1957-1976 
                  W.A. provides for the inspection by the accused and his solicitor of a copy of the panel of jurors summoned for the relevant sitting of the court for criminal trials. This provision is not reflected in the relevant legislation of all the States, though it is in some.
               
The Juries Act provides for the exercise by an accused of peremptory challenge to the persons called as jurors at his trial:
                     

                        
38. 
                           

                              
(1) Without affecting the right of challenge to the array or for cause shown which might have been claimed or exercised immediately prior to the coming into operation of this Act, and without affecting the right of those prosecuting for the Crown to pray for an order to stand jurors aside to the extent authorised by subsection (2) of this section, any party at any criminal trial may challenge peremptorily eight jurors, except where two or more than two persons are charged with the same offence and are put on trial together in which case each of those persons may challenge peremptorily six jurors.

                              
                              
                              
(3) A right to challenge a juror must be exercised before the officer of the Court who is administering the oath, has begun to recite the words of the oath to the juror or where the juror reads the words of the oath from a card before the juror begins to recite those words, but not afterwards.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
                        
40. The law in the case of criminal trials respecting notice to an accused person of his right of challenge, and challenge to the array and to individual jurors for cause, and the ascertainment of facts as to challenge, and the swearing of the jury and informing them of the charge, and the discharge, death, or incapacity of a juror and the separation and confinement of the jury, and view by the jury, and special and general verdicts, and the discharge of the jury, is that which is set forth in The Criminal Code.

                        
                     

                  

               

               
Section 634 of the Code provides for representation of an accused by counsel:Every person charged with an offence is entitled to make his defence at his trial and to have the witnesses examined and cross-examined by his counsel.The term ""counsel"" includes any person entitled to audience as an advocate.
                  

               

               
The Court, on the argument of this application, was informed by counsel for the Crown that there is a long-standing practice in Western Australia for counsel to ""exercise the right of challenge"". I gather that a like practice exists in Queensland and, indeed, now in the United Kingdom. In some other States, the practice is for the accused personally to exercise the right of challenge assisted in at least one of those States, by leave of the trial judge, by counsel or instructing solicitor.
               
What happened in relation to the challenge of the jury in the proceedings upon the indictment of the applicant is beyond dispute. There is before us a portion of the transcript taken in the proceedings which evidences the empanelling of the jury. It is as well that I set out the relevant parts of that transcript. Mr. Cannon was counsel for the accused and Mr. Seaman, Crown Prosecutor:
                     
Clerk of Arraigns: Roger James McGregor Johns, the persons whose names you will now hear called are the jurors who are to decide between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and you upon your trial.If therefore you wish to challenge them or any of them, you must do so as they come to be sworn and before they are sworn and you shall be heard.
                     
Members of the jury, answer to your names and take the box as you are called.
                     

                        
Wallace J.: You may be seated, Johns.

Accused: I challenge.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Number 30, Bernard Victor Ransom.
                     
[Inaudible conversation between Mr. Seaman and Mr. Cannon]
                     

                        
Mr. Cannon: The last witness is not challenged, sir.
                     

                        
Wallace J.: The last one. That is 22, Therese Veronica Ryan.
                     

                        
Mr. Seaman: Yes, sir.

Number 18, Marion Dorothy London. Number 1, Betty Videon Williams. Number 3, Terence John Carter.
                     

                        
Mr. Seaman: Stand aside.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Number 32, Frederick John Winnett.
                     
Number 34, Leonard James Dodd.
                     
Judith Anne Lowes, will you please stand and read the oath?
                     

                        
Juror Lowes: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Peter David Fraser.
                     

                        
Juror Fraser: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Therese Veronica Ryan.
                     

                        
Juror Ryan: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Bernard Victor Ransom.
                  

               

               
Though not included in the portion of the transcript before this Court, the Court was informed, and it may be accepted, that after the arraignment of the accused, his counsel announced to the trial judge that he would exercise the right of challenge, a statement which apparently the trial judge accepted as a matter of course.
               
The applicant filed an affidavit in support of his application in which, apart from explaining the delay in making the present application, he said that he had not authorized the withdrawal of his challenge or acquiesced in the juror whom he challenged being sworn: and that, after he had challenged the juror, his counsel approached him where he stood in the dock and berated him for attempting to interfere in the conduct of the trial. The applicant in his affidavit said that, later, when addressing the jury, his counsel informed them that he followed the practice of never challenging a juror. There was no denial of the applicant's affidavit. I mention these facts for a purpose which will later appear.
               
Counsel for the Crown advanced an argument based upon what he claimed was the precise order of events in relation to the conversation by the counsel with the accused. In my opinion, this conversation probably took place after counsel had purported to withdraw the challenge to the juror and probably after the challenged juror had been sworn. But, in any case, and whenever it occurred, I would not for a moment accept the Crown's argument founded on what had taken place between counsel and the applicant, either that the accused then authorized, or acquiesced in, the withdrawal of the challenge.
               
In my opinion, the simple fact of the matter is that the applicant duly challenged the juror. The challenge must have been heard by the presiding judge. It is evident that the judge allowed that juror to be sworn only because of counsel's statement of the withdrawal of the challenge as recorded in the transcript. In the result, that juror was sworn and the applicant's challenge ignored. This must, in my opinion, in no small part have been due to what, as I shall point out, was a fundamental misconception of the authority of counsel. I cannot think that, but for the practice of which I have spoken and this misconception, a trial judge would not have given full effect to the accused's personal challenge. It could only be because the judge was diverted by that practice and the acceptance of the view that counsel could lawfully override the wishes of his client that the judge failed to realize the fundamental error of not giving effect to the challenge.
               
The right of challenge, and particularly the right of peremptory challenge, lies at the very root of the jury system as it now exists. That the challenge is peremptory means that the accused need not in any wise justify his challenge. It need represent no more than his personal objection to be tried by the person whom he sees before him and whose name he has heard. No doubt, in deciding whether or not to exercise the right of challenge, an accused may profit by the views of counsel. But, even so, he may prefer his own instinctive reaction to the person he sees to the experience or theories of the advocate. It is his peculiar right to follow his own impressions and inclinations.
               
When a prior view of the panel of jurors summoned for the sittings is allowed, some guidance in the exercise of the challenge may be gained from the knowledge of the names, addresses and occupations of those named on the panel. But, in my opinion, this advantage cannot displace the importance of a physical view of the jurors or be a reason to overbear the accused's reaction engendered by it.
               
For my part, it is of the utmost importance in the trial of accused persons that they not only have adequate opportunity to see and observe the jurors but that they are adequately informed of their personal right of challenge. I hold the view that the traditional admonition of the clerk of arraigns, statutory in Western Australia by virtue of s. 626 of the Code, does not sufficiently inform the accused of his rights, e.g. as to the extent of peremptory challenges and as to his right to challenge for cause. If the accused is represented by counsel it may be taken that counsel is not only himself aware of these rights but that he has apprised his client of them in due time to enable the accused effectively to exercise them. If the accused is unrepresented, the usual formula used by the clerk of arraigns should, in my opinion, be supplemented by the trial judge to ensure that the accused is fully aware of his right of challenge. Incidentally, the obligation to inform the accused of his right of challenge is, as I have said, statutory in Western Australia and not merely required as a matter of practice. It may therefore be doubtful if the decision in Reg. v. Berkeley
                  
    [19]
   is applicable in that State.



                         [1969] 2 Q.B. 446.


               
To return to the particular facts of this case, it is incontestable that the denial of the applicant's right of challenge vitiates the proceedings on the indictment. It is settled that if an accused's challenge is improperly disallowed or not given effect, the subsequent proceedings cannot yield a lawful conviction: they are said to be absolutely void: Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed., vol. 2, par. 260, e.g. R. v. Edmonds
                  
    [1]
  , per Abbott C.J., and R. v. Williams
                  
    [2]
  . Thus, there never has been a trial of the indictment in this case according to law. The conviction consequent on these proceedings must therefore be set aside.



                         (1821) 4 B. & Ald., at p. 473 [106 E.R., at pp. 1010-1011].

                         (1925) 19 Cr. App. R. 67.


               
It remains for me to deal with two matters: first, the need for safeguards when and where there is a practice under which counsel is allowed to exercise the accused's right of challenge, and secondly, whether where there has not been a trial according to law, the court, having regard to the terms of the Code, can quash the conviction and, in its discretion, direct a trial.
               
I have referred to s. 634 of the Code which gives the accused a right to counsel at his trial. It may be doubted, in my opinion, whether the expression ""to make his defence"" in that section is apt to include the exercise of the right of challenge to the jury. But, whatever the correct view of those words, the trial judge, in my opinion, can allow counsel who is authorized to do so to exercise for the accused his right of challenge. For reasons to which I will refer, I think it necessary for care to be take to ensure that the accused has given that authority and that the accused understands that the grant of this authority has not displaced his personal right of challenge.
               
In my opinion, a retainer or instruction to defend the accused does not automatically carry such an authority. It must, in my opinion, come specifically from the accused, either expressly or by clear implication; preferably, in my opinion, expressly. In my opinion, it is of the utmost importance that his delegation to counsel of his right of challenge should be specific and certain. In any case, that authority cannot be irrevocable or authorize the withdrawal of the accused's personal challenge when made, or be understood to displace the accused's ability personally to challenge.
               
If the profession understands that counsel needs such specific authority, counsel's statement to the trial judge that he is to challenge the jury may in general be accepted by the trial judge as an assertion by counsel that he has the accused's authority to exercise his right of challenge. Counsel could be expected to be scrupulous in this regard.
               
But, as I have said, the authority to counsel cannot be irrevocable. The accused clearly retains his right of personal challenge on the view of the jurors. Thus, in this case, assuming that his counsel had the accused's authority to challenge for him, the accused's personal challenge was none the less effective. Without further specific authority from the accused, counsel could not countermand or withdraw the challenge personally made by the accused.
               
When the practice of counsel exercising the right of challenge is allowed and the counsel's statement with its implication of specific authority is made and accepted, it would still be proper, in my opinion, for the presiding judge to ensure that the accused is given to understand that, notwithstanding the authority given to counsel, he retains the right personally to challenge. This should be done, in my opinion, just after the clerk of arraigns tells the accused that he must challenge the jurors as they come to the book to be sworn—a statement which incidentally is made to the accused even in places where the practice of allowing counsel to challenge obtains. The traditional formula is emphatic that it is the accused who has the right to challenge.
               
If the authority of the accused to challenge for him is accepted by counsel, it seems to me that counsel should be careful to defer to the wishes of the accused. In the instant case, counsel had his own view as to whether any challenge should be made: with him it was a matter of general policy not to challenge any juror. There may be some who would agree with this policy but, in my opinion, many, if not most, would doubt its wisdom. But, however that may be, adherence to such a policy would leave little or no room for the accused's own choice: and, after all, it is the accused who is in jeopardy, not his counsel or his counsel's reputation.
               
The possible division of the challenge between counsel and the accused has obvious dangers besides that which this case illustrates. For example, it could happen that counsel exercising the challenge may exhaust the limited right of peremptory challenge and the accused later wish to challenge a juror. There is much to be said for the practice of calling twelve persons to the jury box where they can be seen by the accused and thereafter an interval allowed between their placement there and the taking of any step to swear any of them. To ask the accused to challenge severally as each card is drawn and the juror comes forward may result in the exhaustion of the right before all intending jurors have been inspected.
               
Because of the dangers which I think attend the practice of counsel challenging, it is my opinion that the practice of allowing counsel or instructing solicitor to assist the accused in challenging is preferable. It is said that the practice of the challenge by counsel is desirable because an accused may be incapable for one reason or another of deciding on the challenge. But, if the accused is fit to plead (and s. 631 of the Code provides for the determination of that fact), the accused, in my opinion, is fit to challenge. After all, and with due respect to some of the theories advocates may have as to the choice of a jury, the expression of objection to be tried by a person standing before him or her must be one of the simplest things a person can be asked to do. If the accused lacks confidence in this task, the assistance, rather than the dominance, of counsel should provide the remedy. Permission to counsel to assist should, of course, be immediately forthcoming.
               
Then it is said that, by standing near the dock to assist the accused, counsel's dignity is compromised. I regret profoundly to differ. I do not believe it is in the least undignified, demeaning, or undesirable for counsel to be proximate or to be seen to be proximate to an accused when assisting him with the challenge. But I do think that a practice of the exchange of signals between bar table and accused in the course of the challenge lacks dignity and is far less acceptable than the presence of counsel near the dock when assisting the accused in the challenge.
               
There remains the question raised by counsel for the Crown, namely, whether s. 704 of the Code prevents the court ordering a venire de novo where there has been no trial, the court being confined to ordering a new trial consequent on finding a miscarriage of justice.
               
In my opinion, s. 704 of the Code has not produced this result. It was held in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions
                  
    [3]
   that the Court of Criminal Appeal could under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c. 23) (which contains a counterpart section to s. 704), direct the trial of an indictment where, because of fundamental defects in the proceedings, there had not been a trial according to law, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal under that Act, unlike in this respect the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Code, could not order a new trial upon a miscarriage of justice. It seems to me that the reasoning leading to this decision is applicable in Western Australia. Accordingly, in my opinion, the Court of Criminal Appeal can order the trial of an indictment when the proceedings thereon are held to be void.



                         [1921] 2 A.C. 299.


               
It has been held in England that, when setting aside a conviction because of a mistrial, the Court of Criminal Appeal is not bound to order a trial but may merely quash the conviction: see R. v. Gee
                  
    [4]
   and Reg. v. Gash
                  
    [5]
  . In my opinion, the decision and its reasoning warrant the conclusion that the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia is not bound to order a trial of an indictment where there has been none according to law.

Accordingly, the Court considered in this case whether, having regard to the period already spent in gaol by the applicant and the circumstances of the case, a trial should be ordered. It concluded, none the less, that there should be a trial and ordered accordingly.
            


               
Gibbs J.
               
This was an application for enlargement of time within which to seek special leave to appeal, and for special leave to appeal, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia given on 12th March 1976 convicting the applicant of the offence of armed robbery and from an order of that Court made on 26th August 1976 sentencing him to a term of imprisonment for that offence.
               
This Court, after hearing argument, enlarged the time for making the application, granted special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia given on 2nd August 1976 dismissing an appeal from the conviction, treated the application as the hearing of the appeal, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction, and ordered a new trial. The Court announced that the reasons for taking this course would be given later.
               
At his trial, which commenced on 11th March 1976, the applicant was represented by counsel. We are told—although the transcript is silent on this matter—that when counsel announced his appearance, he announced also that he would be exercising the applicant's right of challenge. The transcript records the applicant's plea of not guilty and the names of counsel representing the Crown and the applicant, and thereafter records the proceedings verbatim. The clerk of arraigns informed the applicant in the usual way that if he wished to challenge any of the jurors, whose names were about to be called, he must do so as they came to be sworn and before they were sworn. The clerk then commenced to call the jurors. Two jurors were called; no challenge was made, and the jurors entered the jury box. When the clerk called the name of the third juror, ""No. 22, Therese Veronica Ryan"", the applicant said, ""I challenge"". The transcript does not show what Therese Veronica Ryan did, but the clerk proceeded to call the name of another juror. According to the transcript, there was then an inaudible conversation between counsel, after which counsel for the applicant said, ""The last witness [sic] is not challenged, sir."" The learned trial judge then said: ""The last one; that is 22, Therese Veronica Ryan."" Counsel for the Crown replied, ""Yes sir"". Neither the judge nor counsel said anything further, and the clerk went on to call the names of other jurors. It may be inferred that Therese Veronica Ryan entered the jury box after the exchange between the judge and counsel had been concluded, because, after twelve jurors in all had entered the box, the oath was administered in turn to each of the twelve, including Therese Veronica Ryan. The trial then proceeded.
               
The applicant swore in an affidavit which was uncontradicted that a few minutes before he had been called upon to plead to the charge, and just before the learned trial judge had entered the court, he had been standing near the dock at the rear of the courtroom and had overheard a group of prospective jurors conversing. Because of what he heard and the general impression made upon him by the person later identified as Therese Veronica Ryan, he decided that he did not wish her to be a member of the jury, but before he could communicate with his counsel the learned trial judge entered the room and the proceedings commenced. He said that without any reference to him his counsel informed the judge that there was no challenge of Ryan, and again without reference to him the judge allowed Ryan to be sworn.
               
Before us, counsel for the Crown criticised some statements in the applicant's affidavit. The applicant said: ""Nothing was said by my counsel to the Court or me to indicate that he proposed to exercise any right of challenge on my behalf."" Counsel for the Crown pointed out that this statement could not be correct if, as appears to be admitted, counsel had announced his intention to exercise on behalf of the applicant his right of challenge. The applicant further swore: ""My conclusion that I had no personal right of challenge was reinforced shortly after Ryan was sworn when my counsel approached me in the dock in the presence of the jury thus sworn and whilst further jurors were being called rebuked me for ""interfering""."" Counsel for the Crown submitted that this statement also was inaccurate, since Therese Veronica Ryan was not sworn until all the other jurors had been called into the box. Notwithstanding these criticisms, it is not in doubt either that the applicant audibly stated in open court that he challenged the juror or that, as a result of the intervention by his counsel, and without reference to him, no effect was given to the challenge. Nor is it in contest that counsel for the applicant, in his address to the jury, commented on the fact that he had not challenged any juror and said that it was his policy and philosophy not to challenge.
               
After his conviction, the applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal on a number of grounds, but did not then raise the contention that the trial was defective by reason of the disallowance of the challenge to the juror. He swore—and again his evidence was uncontradicted—that he was advised by counsel that this circumstance did not constitute a ground of appeal. On 2nd August 1976 the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, on 26th August 1976, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which he was still serving when the present application was made.
               
In September 1976 the applicant formed the opinion, as a result of something which he read in a book borrowed from the prison library, that in fact there had been a defect in his trial as a result of the disallowance of his challenge. He made various attempts to raise this matter for consideration. He twice petitioned His Excellency the Governor—on 12th May 1977 and 31st January 1978—but neither petition was granted. In June 1978 he brought proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus but his application was dismissed. Finally, after an initial refusal, he obtained legal aid to make the present application. It should be added that during this time the applicant was asserting his innocence of the charge of which he was convicted.
               
By s. 38 (1) of the Juries Act, 1957 
                  W.A. as amended, it is provided, inter alia, that ""any party at any criminal trial may challenge peremptorily eight jurors"". Before Therese Veronica Ryan was called, no juror had been challenged by or on behalf of the applicant, and the applicant's right of peremptory challenge still remained available. It is clear that the applicant attempted to exercise that right. The traditional manner of indicating that a juror is challenged is to use the word ""challenge"", as the applicant did. However, on behalf of the Crown it was submitted that in the circumstances of the present case, where counsel had authority to conduct the proceedings on behalf of the applicant, the right of challenge could be exercised only by counsel and not by the applicant himself. It was pointed out that it has for very many years been accepted by the courts of Western Australia that counsel appearing for an accused person may exercise the right of challenge on his behalf, and that in practice, when an accused person is represented by counsel, it is counsel who makes the challenge. The courts of New South Wales and Victoria adhere to what is perhaps an even older practice, and require the accused person himself to make the challenge, although permission is usually given to his counsel (or, in Victoria, his solicitor) to assist him in doing so. However, Western Australia is not alone in allowing counsel to exercise the right of challenge; the courts of Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania take the same course, as do the courts in England (see 
                     Archbold's Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases, 39th ed. (1976), par. 421, and Harris, Criminal Law, 22nd ed. (1973), p. 731). Nor is the practice novel: the report of R. v. Parry
                  
    [6]
   reveals that at that trial challenges were made by counsel for the prisoners, and it is not there suggested that this was anything out of the ordinary. In New Zealand, counsel is reported to have exercised the right of challenge in R. v. Davis and Haines
                  
    [7]
   again, apparently, as a matter of course.



                         (1837) 7 Car. & P. 836, at pp. 837-838 [173 E.R. 364, at p. 365].
(1910) 12 C.L.R. (N.Z.) 700,  at p. 705.
                     


               
There are, in my opinion, strong arguments in favour of the practice which exists in Western Australia. An accused person who is mentally defective, illiterate, unable to speak English, or merely inarticulate or generally ill-equipped, could not be expected to make an effective use of his right of challenge if called upon to exercise it himself. And, as is said in the statement of the General Council of the Bar cited in Archbold, op. cit., par. 421: ""It is equally not desirable, and undignified, for counsel to stand by the defendant, prompting him as to what to say and when to say it, with whispered instructions and advice passing to and fro."" Perhaps an argument in support of the view that an accused person should personally exercise the right of challenge is that the accused might recognize someone whom he did not wish to have on the jury only when that person was called to the jury box, but in most jurisdictions the legal representatives of the accused are entitled to inspect the panel of jurors before the trial and in any case, for reasons which I shall go on to state, the accused himself can, as a last resort, make a challenge if his counsel fails to do so.
               
But whatever may be said as to the benefits and demerits of the respective practices, there can be no doubt that that which obtains in Western Australia is permitted by the law. It is true that the right of challenge is in terms conferred by statute on the accused: see s. 38 (1) of the Juries Act; ss. 626-628 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia. However, those provisions do not evince an intention that the right of challenge should be exercised by the accused himself; they do not derogate from the general principle that a party to legal proceedings may entrust the conduct of those proceedings to his legal representative. There are many other sections of the Criminal Code which in terms confer rights on an accused person, but which do not appear to be intended to require that the rights must be exercised personally. For example, it could hardly be suggested that counsel for the accused cannot be heard to make any of the applications referred to in ss. 577, 608, 609, 613, 614, and 624, or that a motion for arrest of judgment under s. 655 must be made by the convicted person himself. In the present case, the authority of counsel to represent the applicant at the trial extended to such incidental matters as challenging the jurors.
               
The fact that counsel had authority to exercise the right of challenge on behalf of the applicant did not mean that the applicant could not himself exercise that right. Clearly, the applicant could have withdrawn the authority of his counsel and then made the challenge but it was not necessary that he should go to that extent. No doubt, if the learned trial judge had thought it necessary to ensure the orderly conduct of the trial, he might have insisted that the applicant either conduct the proceedings himself or leave their conduct to counsel, but, in that event, counsel, if continuing to appear, would have been bound to persist in the challenge; his alternative, if he did not wish to act on his client's instructions, would have been to return his brief. However, the learned trial judge did not intervene and the challenge made by the applicant was, in my opinion, an effective exercise of his right; it was a valid challenge.
               
Then the question arises whether the challenge thus made was effectively withdrawn. It is by no means clear that a challenge once made can be withdrawn. The learned author of Joy, On Peremptory Challenge of Jurors (1844), said,  at p. 88
                  : ""If a prisoner challenge a juror peremptorily, it seems he must abide by the challenge; he cannot afterwards withdraw it for the purpose of challenging another juror instead."" Authority for the latter part of that statement, that a challenge cannot be withdrawn for the purpose of challenging another juror instead, is provided by R. v. Parry. The more general statement that a prisoner must abide by a peremptory challenge once made seems to be supported by the old case of Viccaridge v. Gelse
                  
    [8]
  . On the other hand, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R. v. Kearley
                  
    [9]
   seems to have proceeded on the view that a trial judge has a discretion to allow a peremptory challenge to be withdrawn. This authority would appear to be consistent with the statement of the law in the United States, contained in 50 Corpus Juris Secundum (tit. ""Juries""), par. 284, p. 1080:After a peremptory challenge has been made, a party has no right to withdraw it. The court may, however, in its discretion allow the challenge to be withdrawn where no prejudice will result.

                         [1907] Q.W.N. 50.


               
It is unnecessary to decide whether the learned trial judge had a discretion to allow the challenge to be withdrawn, because, assuming that he had such a power, he does not appear to have exercised it. Counsel for the applicant did not in terms ask leave to withdraw the challenge; in stating that the juror (as of course he meant) was not challenged he appears to have been expressing the view that the attempted challenge by the applicant was a nullity. The learned trial judge gave no express ruling and his action in silently allowing the juror to be sworn is more consistent with the view that he accepted that no valid challenge had been made than with the view that he gave permission to withdraw a challenge effectively made. Moreover, in my opinion, the applicant's counsel had no authority to withdraw the challenge which his client had made. It was not simply unwise for counsel to attempt to override his client's action as he did, but his general authority did not enable him, without obtaining instructions from his client, to reverse a step deliberately taken by his client in the course of the trial. In my opinion, no withdrawal of the challenge was effected.
               
The present case is distinguishable from Reg. v. Harrington and Hanlon
                  
    [10]
  . The facts of that case, so far as they are relevant, are stated in the judgment as follows,  at p. 2:
                  When the tenth or eleventh juryman came to be sworn, junior counsel for the appellant Harrington had undertaken the burden of exercising the right of challenge not only on behalf of his client, but on behalf of another defendant as well. When that juryman had risen, taken up the book and begun reading from the card with which he had been provided, it seems that Harrington intimated that he wanted to challenge that juror. Apparently he uttered the word ""challenge"" but it does not seem to have been audible beyond the confines of the dock, but counsel, as was his duty, pursued the matter and repeated the challenge audibly at the stage when the juryman had spoken the words: ""I swear by Almighty God"", while holding the book, as he had been told to do.The learned trial judge held that the challenge was too late to be effective. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal, holding that the strict rule, that the time for challenging a juror is before the swearing of that juror begins, is still in force and that the relaxation of that rule is a matter of discretion. It does not appear to have been argued at any stage that the prisoner himself had made an effective challenge, and no doubt this is explained by the fact that his utterance was not audible beyond the confines of the dock.

The right of challenge has existed from very early times. The right of a prisoner accused of felony to challenge peremptorily no less than thirty-five jurors was established at least by the fifteenth century, for it is mentioned by Fortescue (see Stephen: History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 1, p. 302). The number of challenges has been limited by statute, but the right remains. Over the centuries, eminent lawyers have constantly asserted the importance of the right of challenge, which, as was said in Forsyth, History of Trial By Jury (1852), p. 175, ""is almost essential for the purpose of securing perfect fairness and impartiality in a trial"". According to Coke, ""the end of challenge is to have an indifferent trial, and which is required by law; and to bar the party indicted of his lawful challenge, is to bar him of a principal matter concerning his trial"": 3 Inst. 27, c. 2 (cited in Joy, op. cit., p. 1). In Mansell v. The Queen
                  
    [11]
   Lord Campbell C.J. said that without the power of challenge ""it is quite obvious that justice could not be satisfactorily administered; for it must often happen that a juror is returned on the panel who does not stand indifferent, and who is not fit to serve upon the trial, although no legal evidence could be adduced to prove his unfitness"". That reason remains convincing today. More recently Lord Devlin has said (in Trial by Jury, p. 31):Trial by jury will be useless as a safeguard for the subject, as it has proved useless in the past, if it means trial by a packed jury. Therefore the precautions which the law takes to secure that a jury is unbiased and independent must be preserved and understood. 
                  There is good reason for the rule, which is established by the authorities, that if a peremptory challenge by an accused person is wrongly disallowed there is a mistrial and the conviction will be quashed: see Gray v. The Queen
                  
    [12]
  ; Levinger v. The Queen
                  
    [13]
  ; R. v. Williams
                  
    [14]
  ; Reg. v. Page
                  
    [15]
  . In such a case, under the old procedure, a venire de novo might have been ordered, and in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions
                  
    [16]
   it was held that the power to order a venire do novo passed to the Court of Criminal Appeal in England. However, in Western Australia the proper course, if a conviction is quashed in these circumstances, and if it is considered that the accused should not be discharged, is to order a new trial. Section 704 of the Criminal Code, like s. 20 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 
                  Eng. considered in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions abolished writs of error and the existing powers of the Supreme Court in respect of new trials, but the Criminal Code, unlike the Criminal Appeal Act, gave the Court of Criminal Appeal power to order a new trial in any case in which it allowed an appeal against conviction (s. 689 (2)) and this, in Western Australia, was the substitute for the procedure which was abolished. If, within time, the applicant had appealed against his conviction on the ground that his right of challenge had been wrongfully denied, the appeal should have been allowed, but, in the circumstances, a new trial should have been ordered.

The failure of the applicant to raise this matter when he appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1976, and the delay that has since occurred, were serious obstacles in his path to a successful application for enlargement of time and the grant of special leave to appeal. However, in the circumstances which I have mentioned, which provide some explanation for his failure and delay, and having regard to the gravity with which we must view any denial of the rights of an accused person in empanelling a jury, it was appropriate to exercise our discretion in favour of the applicant, to treat his application as an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, to allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.
            


               
Stephen J.
               
An accused's right to peremptory challenge is both ancient and important, being fundamental to our system of trial by jury. As became very apparent in argument on the present application, variations exist from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in Australia concerning both the precise mode of its exercise and the extent (if any) to which an accused is assisted in its exercise by being supplied with information about the composition of the jury panel in advance of the trial. Opinions may differ upon such procedural aspects. There can, however, be no doubt that an accused must always effectively retain the right, if he wishes, personally to exercise his peremptory challenges until they are exhausted. When exercised by him the court must give effect to them. Since that did not occur in the present case, as appears from the circumstances of the trial as recounted in other judgments, the orders made by this Court followed as a necessary consequence.
            


               
Mason J.
               
I am in agreement with the reasons for judgment prepared by Gibbs J.
            


               
Murphy J.
               
Mr. Johns applied for special leave to appeal against a judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Court of Criminal Appeal) dismissing his appeal on 2nd August 1976. His application was well out of time and he relied solely on the ground that his trial and conviction before the Supreme Court on 12th March 1976 was a nullity because his right to challenge a juror was denied him. The applicant did not take this point at his trial or on his appeal to the Supreme Court, but raised it in the first of his petitions of mercy under s. 21 of the Criminal Code Act, 1913 
                  W.A. which was denied, as was the second, and also on his application to the Supreme Court for habeas corpus which was dismissed.
               
An accused's ancient right of peremptory challenge to a number of jurors is given statutory force by s. 38 of the Juries Act, 1957 
                  W.A. as amended, which provides:
                     

                        
(1) 
                            any party at any criminal trial may challenge peremptorily eight jurors, except where two or more than two persons are charged with the same offence and are put on trial together in which case each of those persons may challenge peremptorily six jurors.

                        
                        
                        
(3) A right to challenge a juror must be exercised before the officer of the Court who is administering the oath, has begun to recite the words of the oath to the juror or where the juror reads the words of the oath from a card before the juror begins to recite those words, but not afterwards.

                        
                     

                  

               

               
On his trial the applicant duly challenged a prospective juror. Without authority from the applicant, his counsel informed the trial judge that the juror was not challenged. The juror was then sworn and participated in the verdict of guilty.
               
The conviction cannot stand.
               
An accused may conduct his trial through counsel but the right to challenge is his, not counsel's. The respondent claimed, and the applicant conceded, that on announcing his appearance for the applicant, counsel stated that he would exercise the right of challenge, but such an arrangement, even if accepted by the court, cannot prevail against the applicant's right to challenge. Counsel did not challenge any prospective juror and in his address to the jury stated that it was his policy not to challenge jurors. It would be improper for counsel, if he had such a policy, to obtain authority to exercise the right of challenge on behalf of an accused unless he had informed the accused that he did not intend to exercise the right. Counsel may be authorized to exercise the right on an accused's behalf, but not to the exclusion of the accused, who cannot be deprived of his right by any prior agreement with, or instructions to, counsel.
               
A judge should permit a challenge to be withdrawn in the same way that he should permit a plea of guilty to be withdrawn if made in mistake. In order to avoid mistakes and to ensure that the right may be effectively exercised, an accused (and his counsel) should have full opportunity to observe and identify jurors before the accused is required to exercise his right of challenge.
               
The trial was a nullity. For this reason, I agreed to the order that the application for special leave should be granted, the appeal allowed, and a trial ordered.",1979-08-08 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

1The proceedings were commenced by summons in June 2012, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant, Dean Thomas Orchard, had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely, conspiring to supply a prohibited drug, heroin, contrary to s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for reasons there explained. 

2On 27 June 2012 I made restraining and other orders under s 10 and s 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), in respect of Mr Orchard's interests in certain property (see New South Wales Crime Commission v Orchard (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 June 2012, unreported).

3The parties now ask the Court to make a further order by consent, dismissing the application for a proceeds assessment order, Mr Orchard having warranted that his only interests in property as at the date of signing the orders were those specified in the schedule to the order.

4Having considered the terms of the order sought and the circumstances in which they are pursued, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 

5Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, with the result that the restraining order ceases to be in force and the proceedings are brought to an end.

Dudemaine v. Coutu, [1943] S.C.R. 464

Date: 1943-06-29

Albert Dudemaine
(Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

Roland Coutu and
Carriere Lumber Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondents.

1943: May 25; 1943: June 29.

Present: Duff C.J. and Davis, Kerwin, Hudson
and Taschereau JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Jury trial—Practice and procedure—Option
made after expiration of delay—Consent of parties to extend delay—Right to jury
trial forfeited and cannot be revived—Rule not one of mere procedure—Conditions
prescribed for jury trial are imperative—Jurisdiction of jury extinguished
after expiration of delay—Article 442 C.C.P.

The appellant brought an action against the
respondents for damages caused to him through the death of his son, killed by
the respondent company's truck driven by the other respondent, and made option
in his statement of claim for a trial by jury. On the 12th of December, 1941,
the trial resulted in a disagreement. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for
the appellant prepared a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the
second trial, and counsel for the respondents agreed in writing to the motion.
But, on the day fixed for the trial, objection was entered by counsel for the respondents
against the hearing of the case by a jury, on the ground that the consent given
by him was not valid. The trial judge overruled the objection, and, after
verdict by a jury, awarded $3,199.60 to the appellant. The appellate court
reversed this judgment on the sole ground that the appellant had forfeited his
right to a jury trial, and the record was sent back to the Superior Court for
trial before a judge without a jury.

Held that the
appeal to this Court should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin,
Hudson and Taschereau JJ. When both parties to an action have forfeited their
right to a jury trial through the expiration of the delay prescribe by article
442 C.C.P., either of them
cannot, even with the consent of the other, revive such right, no more than
they could give a valid consent to a jury trial when the law does not grant
right to it. The obligation, imposed by that article and drawn up in imperative
terms, is more than an ordinary rule of procedure prescribing a delay, which
rule the parties would at liberty follow or extend. The right to a jury trial
is subordinate to the conditions which are intimately connected with it. The
law has not only granted a right to the litigants, but it has also conferred
jurisdiction to twelve persons to hear the case and has imposed upon them the
obligation to perform their duties, when the request has been made to the court
within the prescribed delay. Consequently, when the delay has expired, a
conditional right has been lost because the condition has not been fulfilled;
and the jurisdiction of the jury has passed away and cannot be re-established,
even with the consent of the parties.

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the ; judgment of the
Superior Court, Savard J. and referring the case back to that Court for a new
trial.

The appellant, on the 9th of October, 1941,
brought an action against both respondents claiming damages for an amount of
$5,199.79 and making option for a trial by jury. On the 23rd of December, 1940,
the truck of the respondent company, driven by the respondent Coutu, had struck
and killed the appellant's son. A few days before the trial, the appellant
filed an incidental demand for seizure before judgment of the respondent company's
truck. A first trial before jury took place in December, 1941, but the jury
disagreed. Following the mistrial, it is contended by the appellant that
pourparlers of settlement had been in order within the thirty days' period
after the date of the first judgment; and both parties admitted that, on the
8th of January, 1942, a letter was written by the respondents' counsel offering
$500 in full settlement of the claim, which offer was refused on the 15th of
January, 1942. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for the appellant prepared
a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the trial; and counsel for
the respondents agreed in writing to the motion. But, on the day fixed, counsel
for the respondents objected to the trial and moved to strike the panel on the
ground that the consent given was not valid and that more than thirty days had
elapsed from the date of the first judgment to the date of the motion for a new
trial. The trial judge overruled the objection and ordered the parties to
proceed with the trial. The respondents were condemned, after verdict by a
jury, to pay to the appellant $3,199.79 for damages, and the incidental demand
respecting the seizure of the truck was also maintained. The appellate court,
without considering the other grounds of appeal, reversed that judgment,
holding that the appellant had lost his right to a jury trial by failing to
proceed within the delay prescribed by article 442 C.C.P.; consequently, the
verdict was quashed and the case was referred to the Superior Court to be heard
before a judge without jury. The appellant appealed to this Court.

Louis Morin K.C. for the appellant.

J. A. Gagné K.C. and W. Desjardins K.C. for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J.
was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal
with costs.

The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—Le fils du demandeur a été frappé par
l'automobile de la Carrière Lumber Company, conduite par un nommé Roland Coutu, qui à ce moment était dans
l'exercice de ses fonctions d'employé. Il est décédé quelques heures après
l'accident, et l'appelant a réclamé des dommages au montant de $5,199.79.

L'action a été instituée le 19 octobre 1941, et le 22 novembre de la
même année, par voie de demande incidente, le demandeur a fait saisir avant
jugement le camion de la défenderesse.

La cause a été entendue une première fois devant un
jury à Amos le 12 décembre 1941, mais par suite d'un désaccord un nouveau
procès s'instruisit le 10 mars 1942. Cette fois, le jury rendit un verdict
accordant au demandeur la somme de $3,199.60, et, par jugement en date du 12 mars, M. le juge Savard confirma ce verdict.

En cours du Banc du Roi, les défendeurs ont attaqué
ce jugement en invoquant les raisons suivantes:—

1. Absence de
responsabilité.

2. Faute contributoire du jeune Dudemaine.

3. Dommages excessifs.

4. Le demandeur avait perdu
son droit à un procès par jury lors du second procès, n'ayant pas fait les
procédures voulues dans les trente jours tel que l'exige l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile.

A l'exception de M. le juge St-Germain qui
enregistra sa dissidence après avoir examiné tous les points soulevés par les
défendeurs, la Cour du Banc du Roi ne considéra que le dernier argument, et en
vint à la conclusion que le demandeur était bien déchu de son droit au procès
par jury et que le dossier devait être retourné à la Cour Supérieure pour qu'il
en soit disposé de la manière ordinaire devant un juge. Et comme conséquence de
ce premier

[Page 467]

jugement, la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu aussi
le second appel des défendeurs se rapportant à la demande incidente, et a rendu
la même ordonnance.

C'est l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile qui doit déterminer les droits respectifs
des parties; il se lit ainsi:

442. A défaut par la
partie qui a demandé le procès par jury de procéder sur cette demande dans les
trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès ou pour un
nouveau procès, elle est de plein droit déchue de là faculté de le faire; mais
le juge peut, sur demande faite dans l'intervalle, lui accorder un délai
additionnel pour raison valable.

L'autre partie peut, dans les quinze jours
après l'expiration de ce délai, procéder au procès par jury.

A défaut de le faire dans aucun de ces cas, la
cause peut être instruite pour enquête et audition en la manière ordinaire.

L'appelant admet évidemment que son application
pour un second procès par jury était tardive, car elle n'a été faite que le 7 février 1942, quand le premier verdict avait été rendu le 12 décembre 1941. Les délais
étaient clairement expirés, mais, l'appelant invoque un consentement signé par
les parties à ce qu'il soit procédé à la formation du rôle des jurés le 11 février 1942. Mais, il est bon de noter que, malgré le consentement donné, le
procureur des défendeurs s'est objecté à la formation du rôle, parce que les
délais étaient expirés et que le consentement était invalide. C'est cette
prétention que la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenue, et elle en est venue à la
conclusion que le délai de trente jours est de rigueur, que les parties avaient
perdu leurs droits respectifs au procès par jury, et que le consentement ne
pouvait les faire revivre.

Il est certain, et la Cour du Banc du Roi admet ce
principe, que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple question de procédure, les
tribunaux doivent donner effet aux consentements donnés par les parties. Mais,
la question qui se pose ici a-t-elle le même caractère? Quand un droit
exceptionnel est donné à condition qu'il soit exercé dans un certain délai,
peut-on faire revivre par consentement ce délai expiré? Car, il est
indiscutable que dans la province de Québec, le cours normal de la procédure
est que tout procès doit s'instruire devant un juge sans jury. C'est par
exception qu'en certains cas, déterminés par le code, il y a lieu au procès par
jury. Mais, lorsque le demandeur désire exercer ce droit restreint, il doit
procéder sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause
est mûre pour le

[Page 468]

procès, et à défaut de le faire, il est déchu
de son droit. Le défendeur peut, dans les quinze jours qui suivent, faire la
même demande, mais il est lui aussi frappé de la même déchéance s'il néglige
d'exercer ce privilège. Même le juge ne peut accorder de prolongation quand les
délais sont expirés.

Cette obligation, imposée par l'article 442 du C.P.C. et rédigée dans des termes
impératifs, me semble être plus qu'une simple règle de procédure déterminant un
délai que les parties peuvent respecter ou prolonger à volonté.

Le droit au procès par jury est subordonné à des
conditions qui y sont intimement liées, et qui pour ainsi dire en font partie.
On ne peut choisir un procès par jury sans accepter toutes les obligations qui
en découlent. Le code, en décrétant en quels cas il y aura lieu à ce mode de
procès, a non seulement accordé un droit aux plaideurs, mais il a aussi conféré
une juridiction à douze hommes d'entendre ce litige, et leur a imposé
l'obligation de servir, quand la demande est faite au tribunal dans les délais
voulus.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a décidé que les deux
parties, déchues de leur droit, ne pouvaient faire revivre ce droit expiré, pas
plus qu'elles ne pourraient donner un consentement valide à un procès par jury,
quand le code ne l'accorde pas. Un droit conditionnel a été perdu, faute de la
réalisation de la condition. La juridiction est maintenant disparue; et
celle-ci ne peut être rétablie par un consentement.

Les tribunaux de la province de Québec ont toujours
interprété sévèrement cette disposition de l'article 442
C.P.C, qui détermine dans quel délai doit agir celui qui
veut conserver son droit au procès par jury. Ainsi, en 1902,
Sir Alexandre Lacoste, parlant pour la Cour du Banc du
Roi, disait dans Canadian Pacific Railway v. Foster[1],

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception et il faut strictement se conformer aux exigences de la loi pour
pouvoir en réclamer le bénéfice.

Le même principe a été réaffirmé en 1940 par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Consolidated Theatres Limited v. Nihon[2]:—

[Page 469]

La demande pour le choix et l'assignation du
jury et pour la fixation des dates doit être faite dans les trente jours de la
définition des faits. La demande pour la définition des faits doit être faite
dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès.
Faute d'observer ces délais, le demandeur perd tous ses droits au procès par
jury.

Et, plus récemment encore, dans Wise v. Boxenbaum[3]:—

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception; pour en pouvoir réclamer le bénéfice, il faut se conformer
strictement aux exigences de la loi. Il ne suffit pas d'avoir opté pour cette
forme de procès et par là d'avoir acquis le droit de s'en prévaloir; il faut
encore conserver ce droit en observant les délais prescrits. Ainsi la
définition des faits doit être demandée dans les trente jours qui
suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès; et la cause est mûre pour le
procès quand la contestation est liée, ou à l'expiration du délai dans lequel
elle devait l'être. Faute d'observer ces délais, la partie perd tous ses droits
au procès par jury.

Je ne crois pas pouvoir, malgré les inconvénients
pratiques qui peuvent en résulter, entretenir une opinion différente de celle
exprimée dans le jugement dont il y a appel, et je le confirmerais.

L'appelant a cité le précédent de Lord v. La
Reine[4]. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait de savoir si
les articles 1020 et 1209 du Code de Procédure Civile de la province
de Québec, qui limitent le temps pour présenter une inscription devant la Cour
du Banc du Roi, imposent des conditions impératives sans lesquelles la cour d'appel n'a pas juridiction, et si les parties
peuvent de consentement prolonger ces délais. La Cour en est venue à la
conclusion qu'il s'agissait d'une question de procédure, où les parties
pouvaient donner un consentement valide. Je ne crois pas, cependant, que cette
décision puisse être interprétée comme voulant dire que les parties peuvent
consentir à soumettre leur litige à un jury quand ce dernier n'a plus juridiction
pour l'entendre.

Quant à l'autre précédent de cette Cour, The Montreal Tramways v. Séguin[5], je crois qu'il n'a aucune application dans
l'espèce. Dans cette cause, on s'est demandé si les parties avaient oui ou non
droit à un procès par jury; mais la demande avait été faite dans les délais
prévus au code. Personne ne s'y était objecté, et cette Cour a décidé, en
conséquence, qu'il y avait acquiescement et chose jugée sur ce point, et qu'on
ne pouvait pas invoquer ce moyen devant un tribunal d'appel. Dans le cas
actuel, lorsque le

[Page 470]

jury a été convoqué, l'intimé s'est objecté à cette
convocation vu l'expiration des délais, et on ne peut en conséquence lui
reprocher un acquiescement ou invoquer contre lui l'autorité de la chose jugée.

Pour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d'opinion que
les deux appels de l'appelant doivent être rejetés avec dépens et vu la
conclusion à laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres moyens
soulevés par l'appelant.

[LawNet Editorial Note: This was an appeal from the decision of the High Court in 
[2010] SGHC 85
.] 
20 January 2011
Judgment reserved.
 Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       This is an appeal against the decision of the trial judge (“the Judge”), who dismissed the claim of Animal Concerns Research & Education Society (“the Appellant”) in the tort of negligence against Tan Boon Kwee (“the Respondent”), in the latter’s capacity as clerk of works (see 
Animal Concerns Research & Education Society v ANA Contractor Pte Ltd and another
 
[2010] SGHC 85
 (“the Judgment”)).
2       Despite the fact that the position of a clerk of works (now known as a “resident technical officer” (see regulation 2(e) of the Building Control (Amendment No 2) Regulations 2007 (S 495/2007) (“the 2007 Regulations”)) and one of two species of “site supervisor” (the other being a “resident engineer”) (see regulation 24(2) of the Building Control Regulations 2003) (S 666/2003) (“the 2003 Regulations”)) is mandated by ss 7 and 10 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), this appears to be the first time this role has arisen for consideration in the Singapore courts.
3       Notwithstanding the change in terminology under the 2007 Regulations, the term “clerk of works” (rather than the term “residential technical officer”) will continue to be used throughout this judgment. The use of the term “clerk of works” is also more appropriate in the context of the actual facts of the present proceedings.
Background facts and the decision below
Background facts
4       The Appellant is an Institution of Public Character under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed), while the Respondent was and continues to remain a director of A.n.A Contractor Pte Ltd (“A.n.A”), the first defendant in the trial below.
5       The Appellant had planned to establish a shelter (“the shelter”) for animals on a plot of land along Jalan Lekar (“the site”) leased from the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”), and appointed A.n.A as the contractor for the project. A.n.A in turn appointed the Respondent as the clerk of works/site supervisor for the project (who was to be employed by A.n.A, rather than by the Appellant). A.n.A also appointed two qualified persons (“QPs”), a qualified architect (“QA”) and a qualified engineer (“QE”), as the QPs for the architectural works and supervision of structural works, respectively, under s 11(1)(
d
)(ii) of the Act.
6       The project, however, was beset by a number of problems, which led to the Appellant suing A.n.A for breach of contract (and negligence) in the proceedings below.
7       Firstly, there was considerable delay in the execution of the project. Secondly, the Appellant alleged that A.n.A had failed to construct the shelter in accordance with the specified building plans. Finally, it transpired that, in the course of levelling the site, wood chips had been used as landfill, resulting in a foul smell and a discharge of blackish effluence from the site. This came to the attention of the SLA and the National Environment Agency (“NEA”), which considered that it amounted to pollution of the surrounding environment and contamination of Kranji Reservoir. As a result, the Appellant is obliged to excavate the rear portion of the site and reconstruct the animal enclosures located there before work at the shelter can begin in earnest.
8       In addition to its claims against A.n.A, the Appellant also sued the Respondent in his capacity as clerk of works of the project, alleging that he had negligently failed to supervise the levelling of the site and, in particular, failed to ensure that wood chips were suitable landfill material.
The decision below
9       The Judge found that, as the land at the site was not level, A.n.A was under a contractual duty to level it (see the Judgment at 
[16]
). A.n.A did so by raising the lower-lying areas of the site in a process known as “backfilling”, 
ie
, bringing in earth from elsewhere to raise the lower regions (see the Judgment at 
[17]
). A.n.A contracted with an entity known as Lok Sheng Enterprises (“Lok Sheng”) to bring in wet soil and wood chips as backfill material for this purpose.
10     The Judge found, based on expert evidence adduced by the Appellant, that the wood chips A.n.A had caused to be used as backfill material were the cause of the pollution and contamination (see the Judgment at [28]).
11     The Judge held that the Appellant had proved its claims against A.n.A for breach of contract in respect of the delay, the failure to comply with the building plans, and the use of wood chips (see the Judgment at [34]–[35]). He considered that it was therefore unnecessary for the Appellant to have proceeded against A.n.A in negligence. There is no appeal against this portion of the Judge’s decision.
12     However, the Judge dismissed the Appellant’s action in negligence against the Respondent, on the basis that s 10(5) of the Act did not impose a duty on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling (see the Judgment at [39]). Section 10(5) of the Act provides as follows:
(5)    Every site supervisor appointed under this section in respect of any building works shall take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving –
(
a
)    in the case of large building works – full-time supervision to the carrying out of the structural elements of the building works; and
(
b
)    in the case of small-scale building works – immediate supervision to the carrying out of the critical structural elements of the building works,
to ensure that the structural elements or critical structural elements, as the case may be, of the building works in question are carried out in accordance with the plans of the building works supplied to him in accordance with section 9(1)(
c
) by a qualified person, and with any terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of Building Control.
There was no dispute that the project works were “small-scale building works” for the purposes of the Act. However, in the Judge’s view, s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act only obliges a site supervisor (including a clerk of works) to supervise the carrying out of “critical structural elements” of small-scale building works, and, according to s 2 of the Act, “structural elements” were “parts or elements of a building” (see the Judgment at [37]). Since earthworks (including backfilling) were not parts or elements of a building, much less “critical structural elements”, the Judge held that the Respondent was not obliged to supervise the backfilling.
13     In addition, the Judge considered that, even if the backfill could be considered a “critical structural element” for the purposes of s 10(5)(
b
), a clerk of works’ obligation under s 10(5) of the Act was merely to ensure that such elements were carried out “in accordance with the plans of the building works… and with any terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of Building Control”. On the facts, however, there was no evidence that the building plans specified a particular material to be used as backfill, or that the Commissioner of Building Control had imposed any terms and conditions relating to the backfill.
14     The Appellant appeals against this portion of the Judge’s decision.
Arguments on appeal
Appellant’s arguments
15     The Appellant submits that, on its true construction, s 10(5) of the Act does impose a duty of care on the Respondent. The Appellant points out that s 2 of the Act includes “foundations” and “all other elements designed to resist forces and moments” within the definition of “structural elements”. Under regulation 2 of the 2003 Regulations, “foundation” means:
that part of a construction immediately below the footings of a building, which is in direct contact with, and through which the weight of a building is transmitted to, the ground, and includes piling works …
The backfill, the Appellant argues, falls within the definition of “foundation” in the 2003 Regulations. Further, according to the testimony of the Appellant’s expert witness, the backfill “wholly supports the weight of the structures built at the back of the [s]ite” and is “one of the critical factors that would affect the structural stability of the structures built on the [s]ite”. As such, the Appellant submits, the backfill is a “structural element” within the meaning of s 2 of the Act, as it is both a “foundation” as well as an element which resists forces and moments, and, given its crucial significance, is therefore a “critical structural element” of the building works. Consequently, according to the Appellant, the Respondent was obliged, under s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act, to take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving “immediate supervision” to the carrying out of the backfilling to ensure that they were carried out in accordance with the building plans, which the Respondent failed to do.
16     In addition, the Appellant submits that the Respondent owed it a common law duty of care to supervise the backfilling, and to ensure that material used as backfill was suitable for its purpose. In this regard, the Appellant submits that the test for the existence of a duty of care, laid down by this court in 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 (“
Spandeck
”), is satisfied on the facts of this appeal, and that the Respondent breached his duty of care to the Appellant, which caused loss to the Appellant that was not too remote.
Respondent’s arguments
17     The Respondent, unsurprisingly, submits that the Judge’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is the correct one, and therefore that the Act did not impose the duty of care for which the Appellant contends.
18     In addition, the Respondent argues that the Act is conclusive as to a clerk of works’ duties, and that there is no reason to impose any common law duty of care above and beyond the statutory duties prescribed by the Act.
19     Finally, the Respondent submits that, even if a duty of care was owed to the Appellant, there had been no breach of this duty by the Respondent.
Issues on appeal
20     The issues which arise for our determination in this appeal are as follows:
(a)     whether s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act, on its true construction, imposes a duty on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling;
(b)     whether, at common law, the Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care to supervise the backfilling;
(c)     whether, if a duty under (a) and/or (b) above existed, the Respondent breached either or both of those duties;
(d)     whether, assuming that there had been a breach of either or both of those duties, such breach or breaches caused the Appellant’s loss and were not too remote; and
(e)     assuming that he was otherwise liable to the Appellant, whether the Respondent can avail himself of any defences.
Our decision
Section 10(5)(
b
) of the Act
Remedying a misconception
21     We should highlight at the outset that even if the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is correct, s 10(5) is, strictly speaking, not determinative of the Respondent’s civil liability to the Appellant in an action for negligence, for it is trite law that there is no common law tort of “careless performance of a statutory duty” (see the House of Lords decision of 
X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council
 
[1995] 2 AC 633
 (“
X v Bedfordshire CC
”) at 732–735).
22     In other words, what the courts in this area are looking for is still a duty of care at common law (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Connor v Surrey County Council
 [2010] 3 All ER 905 at [102]), 
ie
, the statutory duty which a plaintiff alleges sounds in negligence must have been previously held to give rise to a common law duty of care, or must be so declared by the court adjudicating the matter, applying the test in 
Spandeck
. A statutory duty does not 
ipso facto
 impose a concomitant duty of care at common law. A statutory duty may, of course, form the backdrop to and inform the existence (or lack thereof) of a common law duty of care (see, for example, 
X v Bedfordshire CC
 at 739), but that does not mean the statutory duty 
per se
 is a duty of care, even if it is phrased (as here) in terms of requiring the taking of “reasonable steps” and “due diligence”.
23     Even if the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act is correct, therefore, the 
mere existence
 of a statutory duty on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling is not sufficient to establish an action in negligence at common law by the Appellant.
24     Nevertheless, if there is indeed such a statutory duty on the Respondent under s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act (as construed by the Appellant), and the Respondent had breached such a duty, another possible cause of action that the Appellant might have pursued against the Respondent would be one based on the tort of breach of statutory duty. However, this alternative legal route does not appear to have been adopted by the Appellant. Although s 10(5) of the Act clearly imposes some sort of statutory duty on site supervisors, the Act only states that breach of that duty will give rise to 
criminal
 liability under s 10(8) of the Act. As the Act is completely silent on whether breach of s 10(5) also gives rise to 
civil
 liability, and, if so, whether such liability is incurred to a private individual who has suffered loss as a result of the breach, the success of a claim for breach of statutory duty would, in the main, have depended on the construction of the Act in general and s 10(5)(
b
) in particular, in order to ascertain whether the Legislature impliedly intended to provide a right of civil action to enforce the statutory duty (see the leading House of Lords decision of 
Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd
 
[1949] AC 398
 at 407 and 412).
25     The key precondition, however, to the validity of an action for breach of statutory duty would have been the existence and nature of the statutory duty contended for, 
ie
, the correctness of the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act, for the action would fail at the threshold if the relevant facts did not even fall within the ambit of s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act in the first place. Indeed, this is precisely what the Judge found, and it is to that finding that our attention now turns.
Our decision
26     We are of the view that the Judge’s decision on the interpretation to be given to s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act is undoubtedly correct. The definition of “structural elements” in s 2 of the Act clearly refers to parts or elements of a 
building
, and the definition of “building” in s 2 (“any permanent or temporary 
building or structure
” [emphasis added]) contemplates an artificial construct or edifice, and not the ground upon which that construct or edifice rests.
27     Further, the only example of a “building” given in s 2 of the Act which could come close to covering the backfill in the context of the present proceedings is the term “earth retaining or stabilising structure, whether permanent or temporary” found in example (b). However, the term “earth retaining structure” is, in turn, defined in s 2 of the Act as “any structure, structural system or other means used to maintain the shape of excavation 
during … earth filling
” [emphasis added], which suggests that earth filling 
per se
 cannot be a building.
28     Hence, the backfill does not form part of the “structural elements” of the building works, critical or otherwise, and s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act therefore imposed no statutory duty on the Respondent to supervise the carrying out of the backfilling.
Common law duty of care
Introduction
29     It follows from the discussion at 
[21]
−
[23]
 above, however, that the construction of s 10(5)(
b
) of the Act is not determinative of the issue of the Respondent’s common law duty of care, and it is therefore necessary to determine whether, under the 
Spandeck
 test, the Respondent owes a duty of care to the Appellant at common law. As this court observed in 
Ngiam Kong Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock
 
[2008] 3 SLR(R) 674
 (“
Ngiam
”) (at [20]–[21]):
20    The general position in Singapore with respect to liability for negligence in cases of pure economic loss and cases of physical damage has now been settled by the recent decision of this court in Spandeck ([2] supra). Briefly stated, the position in Singapore follows, in the main, the two-stage test laid down by Lord Wilberforce in Anns v Merton London Borough Council 
[1978] AC 728
 (“Anns”), where the learned law lord observed, as follows (at 751-752):
[I]n order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, 
it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been held to exist
. Rather the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter - in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of persons to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may give rise ... [emphasis added]
21    More specifically, Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the judgment of the court in 
Spandeck
, observed thus (at [73]):
 
In our view, a coherent and workable test can be fashioned out of the basic two-stage test premised on proximity and policy considerations, if its application is preceded by a preliminary requirement of
 
factual
 
foreseeability. We would add that this test is to be applied
 
incrementally
 
, in the sense that when applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or policy
. As is obvious, the existence of analogous precedents, which determines the current limits of liability, would make it easier for the later court to determine whether or not to extend its limits. However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor. 
We would admit at this juncture that this is basically a restatement of the two-stage test in Anns, tempered by the preliminary requirement of factual foreseeability. Indeed, we should point out that this is the test applied in substance by many jurisdictions in the Commonwealth
: see, for example, the Canadian case of 
Cooper v Hobart
 (2001) 206 DLR (4th) 193; the New Zealand case of 
Rolls-Royce New Zealand Ltd v Carter Holt Harvey Ltd
 [2005] 1 NZLR 324 ... [emphasis added in bold italics]
In a similar vein, the learned Chief Justice summarised the applicable law in Singapore at the end of the judgment in 
Spandeck
 in the following terms (at [115]):
To recapitulate: A 
single
 test to determine the existence of a duty of care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage caused (
ie
, pure economic loss or physical damage). It could be that a more restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss but this is to be done within the confines of a single test. 
This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first, proximity and, second, policy considerations. These two stages are to be approached with reference to the facts of decided cases although the absence of such cases is not an absolute bar against a finding of duty. There is, of course, the threshold issue of factual foreseeability but since this is likely to be fulfilled in most cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of the
 legal 
test for a duty of care
. [emphasis added in bold italics]
[emphasis in original]
30     In 
Ngiam
 itself, the 
Spandeck
 test was extended to encompass liability for psychiatric harm (thus confirming that it is, indeed, a 
single
 test for the existence of a duty of care that is applicable across the board in the tort of negligence). In so far as the law in other Commonwealth jurisdictions was concerned, the following observations were made in 
Ngiam
 (at [105]–[107]):
105    It should also be noted that although the two-stage test in 
Anns
 ([20] 
supra
), which forms the basis of the test laid down by this court in 
Spandeck
, has not been followed in England, the law in that particular jurisdiction continues (as this court noted in 
Spandeck
 at [46]-[49]) to remain in a state of flux (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of 
Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc
 
[2007] 1 AC 181
).
106    It is also interesting to note that the position in Canada is similar to that presently applicable in Singapore, where (as mentioned earlier at [98] above) a somewhat modified version of the two-stage test in Anns has been adopted. In particular, whilst affirming the two-stage test in Anns, the Canadian courts have considered both reasonable foreseeability and proximity under the first stage (see, for example, the Canadian Supreme Court decisions of 
Cooper v Hobart
 (2001) 206 DLR (4th) 193 at [30]-[31]; 
Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse
 (2003) 233 DLR (4th) 193 at [46]-[50]; 
Hill v Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board
 (2005) 259 DLR (4th) 676 at [47]; 
Childs v Desormeaux
 (2006) 266 DLR (4th) 257 at [9]-[12]; and 
Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v BD
 (2007) 284 DLR (4th) 682 at [23]-[30]). This approach is not necessarily at variance with that adopted in 
Spandeck
, for (as we explained above at [104]) the concept of reasonable foreseeability is also an integral part of the process of ascertaining whether there is sufficient (legal) proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant, albeit on a preliminary (and factual) level.
107    The position in Australia appears to be somewhat in a state of flux (see generally Francis Trindade, Peter Cane & Mark Lunney, 
The Law of Torts in Australia
 (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2007) at ch 9).
31     It is interesting to note that the respective situations in the various jurisdictions as summarised in 
Ngiam
 above have not – to the best of our knowledge – changed substantially since then (see, for example, W V H Rogers, 
Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2010) (“
Winfield & Jolowicz
”) at ch 5 (with regard to England); Allen M Linden and Bruce Feldthusen, 
Canadian Tort Law
 (LexisNexis, 8th Ed, 2006) at ch 9, especially at pp 301−306, Lewis N Klar, 
Tort Law
 (Thomson Carswell, 4th Ed, 2008) at ch 5, especially at pp 165−185, as well as the Supreme Court of Canada decision of 
Fullowka et al v Pinkerton’s of Canada Limited et al
 (2010) 315 DLR (4th) 577 (with regard to Canada); and R P Balkin and J L R Davis, 
Law of Torts
 (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) at ch 7, especially at paras 7.12−7.13 (with regard to Australia)).
32     Returning to the facts of the present appeal, as noted above (at 
[29]
), this court decided in 
Spandeck
 that a single test for the existence of a duty of care in the tort of negligence is applicable irrespective of the type of loss suffered, and it is therefore not fatal to the Appellant’s case that the loss for which it seeks to be compensated is pure economic loss, 
viz
, the cost of remedial work.
33     The 
Spandeck
 test requires this court to consider (assuming it was factually foreseeable that the Appellant would suffer damage from the Respondent’s carelessness) whether there was sufficient legal proximity between the Appellant and the Respondent for a 
prima facie
 duty of care to arise (see 
Spandeck
 at [77]), and whether any policy considerations negated this 
prima facie
 duty (see 
Spandeck
 at [83]). This two-stage test is to be applied incrementally with reference to the facts of decided cases in analogous situations (see 
Spandeck
 at [73]).
34     In essence, what this court has to decide, in the context of the present appeal, is whether, at common law, a clerk of works owes a duty to the person commissioning the building works (who may or may not, contractually, be his employer) to take reasonable care in supervising the carrying out of those works. Even if such a duty of care exists, there must, 
inter alia
, have been a breach of such a duty of care by the Respondent resulting in damage that must not have been too remote in order for the Respondent to be liable to the Appellant. However, the establishment of a duty of care is an obvious threshold requirement that must first be established (in this case, by the Appellant). It is this issue (and, in particular, the legal criteria laid down in the 
Spandeck
 test) that we must now address.
Factual foreseeability
35     The threshold requirement of factual foreseeability is easily fulfilled on the facts of this appeal: it was reasonably foreseeable that if the Respondent did not take care in supervising the backfill operation, the Appellant would suffer some sort of loss or damage. The land might not, for instance, have been backfilled to the proper depth, leading to subsidence and physical damage to any structures resting on the backfill.
Proximity
Introduction
36     As explained in 
Spandeck
 (at [78]–[79]), the focus of the inquiry at this stage of the test is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, and it embraces physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, including (where the facts support it) any voluntary assumption of responsibility by the defendant and/or reasonable reliance thereon by the plaintiff (see 
Spandeck
 at [81]).
Physical proximity
37     There was evidently physical proximity between the parties: the Appellant was the lessee of the site, and the Respondent, by virtue of his appointment as clerk of works/site supervisor, was bound to be physically present at the site in order to carry out his duties (as to which see 
[44]
 below).
Legal proximity
Introduction
38     The concept of proximity requires more than just physical closeness between the parties, however, and in order to determine whether there was a sufficient degree of 
legal
 proximity between the Appellant and the Respondent, it is necessary to examine, in some detail, the status and position of a clerk of works.
The role of a clerk of works
39     According to the 
Clerk of Works Manual
 (Institute of Clerks of Works and Royal Institute of British Architects, 3rd Ed, 1994) (at para 1.01), the term “clerk of works” was historically “given to the cleric or other person appointed to 
superintend
 building operations” [emphasis added]. This is confirmed by John E Johnston, 
The Clerk of Works in the Construction Industry
 (Crosby Lockwood Staples, 1975) (“
The Clerk of Works
”), which states (at p 3) that:
The title Clerk of Works has been in existence since the medieval period, when a clerk was recognised as a man of learning associated with Holy Orders …
Medieval clerks were not always ordained priests, but acted in a lay capacity on behalf of the Church, 
those nominated as Clerk of Works being responsible for the construction and upkeep of buildings. Because of the similarity of their duties, the title was later conferred upon those
 who did not hold Holy Orders but who 
were commissioned to
supervise
the erection and repairs to the Royal Buildings
.
[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
40     It is interesting to note from the above materials that since the Middle Ages, the role of the clerk of works at a building site has been of a supervisory nature. For example, 
The Clerk of Works
 cites (at p 6) records from the time of the restoration of St Paul’s Cathedral in the seventeenth century which state that the clerk of works:
… constantly attends the service of the work to take care that carpenters, labourers, etc, who work by the day, be employed in such business as the Surveyor has directed to be done …
41     The 
Clerk of Works Manual
 notes (at para 1.01) that the attributes of “ability, integrity and vigilance” were considered the most appropriate qualities of a clerk of works, and that these continue to be reflected in the official coat of arms of the Institute of Clerks of Works of Great Britain. The 
Clerk of Works Manual
 further states (at para 3.03) that the functions and attributes of a clerk of works include (
inter alia
):
-     
Inspection
: detecting workmanship which does not comply or materials which do not conform to the contract standards. This will usually mean inspecting in detail, and checking measurements regularly.
-     
Reporting
: keeping the architect fully informed on a regular pre-arranged basis. It also means alerting the architect immediately when situations arise which require decisions or actions.
[emphasis in original]
42     Indeed, it has been the common understanding of the construction industry for over three centuries that (see 
The Clerk of Works
 at p 104):
[t]he primary task of the Clerk of Works is to inspect the work as it proceeds to ensure it is carried out in accordance with the contract drawings and specifications.
For instance, British Standards Institution, 
Glossary of Building and Civil Engineering Terms
 (Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1993), defines (at 160 2015) a “clerk of works” as a “[p]erson appointed to verify, on behalf of a 
client
, that 
construction work
 is executed in accordance with 
drawings
, specifications and other 
contract documents
” [emphasis in original]. That this understanding is shared locally by construction professionals is confirmed by Chow Kok Fong, 
Construction Contracts Dictionary
 (Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2006), who defines (at p 62) a clerk of works as:
A representative of the architect, engineer or superintending officer in a construction contract who is deployed on site to assist the architect, engineer or superintending officer and to inspect the progress of the works on behalf of the architect, engineer or superintending officer.
43     Colin Tesch, 
Construction
 - 
Law and Duties
 (Butterworths, 1977), explains (at [215]) that:
An architect, for his basic agreed fee, does not usually undertake to do more than periodic inspections. If the project is of a large size, or perhaps distant from the architect’s office or maybe only small but complex, full-time supervision may be required. This is provided for by the appointment of a clerk of works.
44     It appears, therefore, that the industry practice has been that clerks of works assist the architect by monitoring the work of contractors on behalf of the person commissioning the construction works (“the client”), in order to ensure that work is carried out to 
the client’s
 standards, specifications and schedule, that the correct materials are used and that proper workmanship is observed.
45     Turning to the relevant case law, in the English High Court decision of 
Leicester Board of Guardians v Trollope
 (reported in Alfred A Hudson, 
The Law of Building, Engineering and Ship Building Contracts and of the Duties and Liabilities of Engineers, Architects, Surveyors, and Valuers; with Reports of Cases and Precedents
, vol II, (Sweet & Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1914) at p 419) (“
Trollope
”), the defendant architect had contracted with the plaintiffs to supervise the building works. A clerk of works had been appointed, who permitted the builders to lay the flooring without the specified precautions, thereby deviating from the defendant’s design, and causing dry rot to set in some years later. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for breach of the contract of supervision, and the defendant denied liability on the ground that the damage had been caused by the negligence or misconduct of the clerk of works. In the course of his judgment, Channell J remarked (at p 423) that:
I think there is no difficulty in seeing what are the respective functions and duties of an architect, and of a clerk of the works. I had a very clear idea of it myself, and the witnesses who have been called for the defendant, two gentlemen of position in the profession, and the defendant himself, who is a gentleman of position in the profession, all practical agree. They all agree that 
the clerk of the works has to see to matters of detail
, and that the architect is not expected… to do so …
Everybody knows that an architect cannot be there all the time, and everybody knows that 
the clerk of the works is appointed to protect the interests of the employer against the builder, mainly because the architect cannot be there
. The same gentlemen who tell us that tell us also that the architect is responsible to see that his design is carried out. That fairly indicates what the respective duties of each are, but it leaves one in each case to say whether the matter complained of is a matter of detail or a matter of seeing whether the design is complied with.
[emphasis added]
On the facts, Channell J decided that the laying of concrete was a matter of design within the architect’s purview, and not a matter of detail that could be left to the clerk of works, and therefore rejected the defendant’s attempt to deny liability.
46     Although in stating that “the clerk of the works is appointed to protect the interests of the employer against the builder” (
Trollope
 at p 423, and reproduced in the preceding paragraph), Channell J used the term “employer”, we are of the view that the position is no different where the client does not formally (pursuant to a contract of service) employ the clerk of works. It is to be noted, however, that although Channell J’s comments in 
Trollope
 on the scope of the duty of a clerk of works have generally been accepted (see 
Jackson & Powell on Professional Liability
 (John L Powell and Roger Stewart Gen Eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) at para 9-246), his eventual decision is more questionable. Even if the laying of concrete had been a matter of design, it appears that the clerk of works had fraudulently colluded with the builder in not taking the necessary precautions, and then concealed the wrongdoing (see 
Trollope
 at p 422). In such circumstances, we would have thought that there would be scope for arguments based on contributory negligence or 
novus actus interveniens
 (see, for instance, the English decision of 
Gray and Others (The Special Trustees of the London Hospital) v T P Bennett & Son (a firm) and others
 (1987) 43 BLR 63). It should be borne in mind, however, that 
Trollope
 had been decided long before these defences were fully developed, and that, on the facts, the architect in 
Trollope
 made no effort to ensure that his design had been complied with.
47     In the English High Court decision of 
Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Area Health Authority v Wettern Composites and others
 (1984) 1 Con LR 114 (“
Wettern Composites
”), the plaintiffs were the board of governors of a hospital to which an extension had been built, consisting of (
inter alia
) artificial stone mullions erected as part of the outer cladding, and which was eventually discovered to be defective. The defendants were, essentially, the architects, whom the plaintiffs had sued in negligence for failing to adequately supervise the erection. In the course of his judgment holding the architects liable, Judge David Smout QC referred (at 133) with approval to the division of duties between the architect and clerk of works commented upon in 
Trollope
, and (at 137–138) stated that the clerk of works:
… has been aptly described as the Regimental Sergeant-Major. It is accepted that 
he acts as the eyes and ears of the architects, and has a responsibility to keep the architects informed as to what is or is not happening on site. He is also described as employed “to act solely as inspector on behalf of the employer under the direction of the architects
.” [emphasis added]
48      
Wettern Composites
 is also notable because the clerk of works concerned was also held to be negligent in failing to detect the defects, which holding demonstrates that, even in matters of detail, the presence of a clerk of works may not exempt an architect from responsibility. As the clerk of works was employed by the plaintiffs, they were held vicariously liable for his negligence, and their damages were reduced by 20% as a result of contributory negligence.
49     Closer to home, in the decision of this court in 
Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd
 
[1999] 3 SLR(R) 771
 (“
Setron
”), the first respondent (“Setron”) owned a building which had been designed by the second respondent (“the architect”), while the appellant (“the contractor”) was the main contractor who was responsible for tiling works on the building’s façade. As a result of defective design on the part of the architect and defective workmanship on the part of the contractor, tiles fell off the façade in such quantities that the entire façade had to be replaced. One of the issues on appeal was the architect’s failure to supervise the tiling works, in breach of its contractual duty to Setron to do so, and the architect attempted to argue that, as on-site supervision had been left to a clerk of works, who was employed by Setron, the architect was not liable for the clerk of work’s negligence.
50     Rejecting this contention, this court held (at 
[40]
) that the clerk of works was the “ears and eyes” of the architects in respect of the day to day on-site supervision of the construction works, and that he was “duty bound to report to the architects of any defect or shortcomings in the construction works”.
51     This survey of authorities demonstrates that, both as a matter of industry practice and judicial observation, a clerk of works is regarded as being, by virtue of his functions and responsibilities at the building site, in fairly close proximity to 
the client
, regardless of whether they are in a formal employer-employee relationship. If, of course, the clerk of works is in fact employed by the client, then there would also be a 
contractual relationship
 (which would, naturally, entail the corresponding legal obligations) between the parties. The clerk of works protects the interests of the client against the builder, by inspecting and supervising the works to ensure that they conform to the client’s budget, standards and specifications, and that the client is getting value for money and proper workmanship. These matters have usually been described as matters of “detail”, but might be more accurately be termed 
operational
 matters, in keeping with the military analogy employed in 
Wettern Composites
 (see 
[47]
 above). In respect of such operational matters, the clerk of works is predominantly responsible, although, as 
Wettern Composites
 illustrates, depending on the circumstances, the architect may share some responsibility. In addition, as the 
Clerk of Works Manual
 and 
Setron
 indicate (see above at 
[41]
 and 
[50]
, respectively), regardless of whether the matter is one of design or operations, the clerk of works should keep the architect abreast of developments at the worksite, especially if he notices defects or shortcomings in the works.
52     All this having been said, however, we are inclined to think that, if a problem arises, the client would not generally sue the clerk of works concerned in either contract and/or tort. Indeed, we have seen that, even where a clerk of works has been at fault, the actual claim has (in the cases considered) been made against the architect (see 
Trollope
, 
Wettern Composites
 and 
Setron
, all of which have been discussed above), with the role of the clerk of works being relevant to the issue of 
vicarious liability
 and 
contributory negligence
. This is not surprising as clerks of works are not generally substantial litigants in their own right (although, as we shall see, this is not the situation in the present appeal, which presents a rather exceptional fact situation). A more important point, however, is that, in the 
tortious
 context
, clerks of works might not even be liable to the client in the first instance
. Let us elaborate.
53     It is important to acknowledge the very real fact that 
the qualifications of clerks of work can vary enormously
. As has been observed in a leading textbook in the field (see I N Duncan Wallace, 
Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 1995) vol 1 (at para 2-024)):
Clerks of works are usually employed for a specific project, in many cases on the recommendation of the architect, though it is not unusual for building owners with their own building departments or organisations to put forward one of their own employees. They are almost invariably employed and paid for by the building owner. ... Their use is more common in building than in engineering contracts... 
Their qualifications may vary from those of a retired tradesman or foreman to a fully qualified archit[e]ct or engineer, but in general their position is considerably inferior to that of a resident engineer, and the extent of their authority much more rigorously circumscribed by the contract documents
 ... [emphasis added]
There are at least two legal consequences that arise from this variation in qualifications of clerks of works.
54     First, the 
scope
 of any duty of care owed by a clerk of works will 
vary
 from case to case and, depending on the fact situation, the scope of the duty of care may not include the acts or omissions complained of. If so, there is no duty that can be 
breached
, even assuming that a duty of care exists in the first instance.
55      
Secondly
, at a 
threshold
 level, 
there might not even be a duty of care to begin with
 (and, on the 
overlap
 between duty and breach, see below at 
[61]
). We are, of course, assuming a situation in which there is 
no contractual nexus
 between the clerk of works concerned and the client to begin with. Whilst, following from the analysis above at 
[39]
−
[51]
, it might be argued that, in such a situation, there would, ordinarily, be a duty of care in 
tort
 owed by the clerk of works to the client (
cf
 Stephen Furst and Sir Vivian Ramsey, 
Keating on Construction Contracts
 (8th Ed, London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2006) (“
Keating
”) at para 13-049), we are of the view that
, in order for such a duty of care to exist, there must first be demonstrated that, on the facts of the case concerned, there had been legal proximity between the parties – for example, that there had been an assumption of responsibility by the clerk of works
 vis-a-vis 
the client. At this juncture, the universal and the particular (necessarily and, indeed, inevitably) intersect, with the focus tending towards the latter (as opposed to the former)
. This necessarily entails an application of the general legal principles to the 
facts
 of the case itself. However, unlike the issue of the 
scope
 of the duty of care referred to in the preceding paragraph, we are 
not
 here stating that the existence of a duty of care is 
dependent on
 the (variable) qualities of the clerk of works. Nonetheless, as we explain below, 
the precise facts
 are 
still
 important in ascertaining whether there has been an assumption of responsibility by the defendant and (correspondingly) whether the element of reliance on the part of the plaintiff has been satisfied.
56     However, can it be argued that a 
particular or specific
 consideration of the 
facts
 of 
a given case
 is 
inconsistent
 with the 
general
 principle that a clerk of works 
ordinarily
 owes a duty of care to his or her client? In our view there is 
no inconsistency
 (a key consideration in this regard, as we shall see, lies in the word “
ordinarily
”).
57     As already alluded to above, the 
general
 principle is (
necessarily
) stated at 
a high level of abstraction and
 consideration must therefore (
and also necessarily
) be given to the 
particular or specific facts
 of the case itself.
58     One such example is to be found on the facts of the seminal House of Lords decision of 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] 1 AC 465
 (“
Hedley Byrne
”), where, although the House of Lords held that it was possible, as a matter of 
general principle
, for a defendant to owe a duty of care with regard to 
negligent misstatements
, there was no liability on the 
facts
 of that particular case as the defendant bank had included 
a disclaimer of responsibility
 in the response it had given to the plaintiff firm. We would observe – parenthetically – that there is, once again, 
an intersection between the universal and the particular
 inasmuch as it could be argued that, 
in addition to
 the effect of such a disclaimer on the 
particular facts
 of the case itself, such a disclaimer represents (at the level of 
general principle
) an instance of what might constitute 
an exception
 to the general proposition that a duty of care can be owed with respect to negligent misstatements at common law. However, what is important, for present purposes, is to acknowledge 
the role of the particular facts
 in ascertaining whether or not a duty of care exists in a given case.
59     Consequently, it is necessary, in the context of the present appeal, to now turn to the 
application
 of the general legal principles to the 
facts
 of this case.
60     Before proceeding to do so, however, we would emphasise that we have hitherto considered 
only
 the position between a clerk of works and the client. By way of a 
summary
 of the analysis rendered thus far, where a 
contractual nexus
 exists between these two parties, there will be contractual liability if a breach of contract can be established by the innocent party. Further, where such a nexus exists, there could well be 
concurrent
 liability for negligence in 
tort
 as well. Where, however, a contractual nexus does 
not
 exist between these two parties, it does 
not necessarily
 follow that there 
must
 be liability for negligence in 
tort
 between these parties simply because a duty of care might not even exist in the first place. As we have sought to emphasise, whilst it would be possible to argue that, on a 
general
 level, a duty of care ought 
ordinarily
 to be owed by a clerk of works to his client, whether or not such a duty of care 
is
 indeed owed in the case at hand would, in our view, depend on the 
precise facts
 in question – in particular, whether there had been an 
assumption of responsibility
 by the clerk of works concerned 
vis-a-vis
 the client (and a corresponding 
reliance
 by the latter on the former). Indeed, 
even if
 such a duty of care existed on the facts, there might 
still
 be 
no
 liability if, again on the 
relevant facts
 of the case concerned, the clerk of works had not 
breached
 that duty.
61     It is apposite, at this juncture, to point out that there is often an 
overlap
 between duty and breach (see generally 
Winfield & Jolowicz
 at para 5-23). Conceivably, in our view, whether the relevant facts of the case are considered at the (earlier) duty stage (as is the case in the present appeal) or at the later breach stage would depend very much on the characterisation as well as level of abstraction adopted by the court concerned. However, acknowledging (as we have done (see below at 
[66]
−
[74]
)) that the relevant 
contractual matrix
 ought (where it exists) to be considered (whether at the first and/or second stages of the 
Spandeck
 test) suggests that, in most of these cases, the court will probably consider (as we have in the present appeal (see below at 
[63]
−
[74]
)) the 
particular facts in order to ascertain whether a duty of care exists
.
62      
It is also important to note that we leave open the point as to whether or not a clerk of works owes a duty of care (even on a general level) to other third parties (who are not the clients as such)
. There might well be a strong argument in favour of excluding such a duty of care (even on a general level; and 
cf Keating
 at para 13-049) but as this is not the fact situation before us, we say no more about this particular issue. We turn, instead, to a consideration of the facts of the present appeal.
Conclusion on legal proximity
63     It should be noted that the Respondent was the main director of A.n.A and that he procured A.n.A to appoint himself clerk of works (see 
[64]
 below). In such circumstances, the Respondent was 
voluntarily assuming the various responsibilities the role carried and holding himself out as possessing the relevant qualifications and skills necessary to discharge that role
. This is exactly the sort of relationship that Lord Devlin in 
Hedley Byrne
 considered (at 529) to be “equivalent to contract”, 
ie
, where there is an 
assumption of responsibility
 in circumstances in which, but for the absence of consideration, there would be a contract.
64     As for whether there was 
reliance
 by the Appellant on care being taken by the Respondent in circumstances where the latter knew or ought to have known of such reliance, it must have been obvious to the Respondent that the Appellant was relying on him as a clerk of works. Indeed, the Respondent intended that he should be so relied on, for he procured his own appointment as clerk of works by naming himself the site supervisor/clerk of works in an application form (“the BCA form”) submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”), in which the Respondent declared that, as site supervisor, he was “not a partner, officer or employee of the builder”. This was, of course, patently false, but was no doubt calculated to convey the impression that the Respondent was an independent and reliable individual with no links to A.n.A, and could therefore be relied upon to act in the Appellant’s interest as a clerk of works.
65     The Respondent contends, however, that if the Appellant had wanted the Respondent to assume some liability to it in the conduct of his responsibilities, it could have sought a personal guarantee from the Respondent or introduced the Respondent as a further party to its contract with A.n.A, but it chose not to do so (see, similarly, 
Spandeck
 at [96]). In such circumstances, the Respondent argues, it cannot be said that he had assumed any responsibility to the Appellant and/or that the Appellant was relying on him.
66     Before we address this argument, we should note that the presence of a contractual matrix is a factor that, whilst considered to be among the “relevant policy considerations” in 
Spandeck
 (at [83]) (and, hence, falling under the 
second
 limb of the 
Spandeck
 test), might, depending on the facts, be appropriately analysed, instead, in relation to the issue of proximity (under the 
first
 limb of the 
Spandeck
 test). That there is, on occasion at least, an overlap between both limbs of the 
Spandeck
 test is not, perhaps, surprising.
67     Indeed, in 
Spandeck
 itself, the contractual matrix was treated as both a proximity factor (at [108]) as well as a policy consideration (at [114]). Similarly, in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter
 
[1990] 1 QB 993
 (“
Pacific Associates
”) (which was, in fact, applied in 
Spandeck
), the court did not adopt an altogether uniform approach towards this issue. Purchas LJ, for example, was of the view (at 1023−1024) that the precise reason adopted “may not in the present case matter very much” as the result would be the same, 
regardless
 of whether it was held (
inter alia
) that there had been no proximity between the parties 
or
 that it would not be just and reasonable to find that a duty of care had been established. Ralph Gibson LJ, on the other hand, appeared (at 1031−1032) to base his decision on what is presently the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test, whilst Russell LJ 
clearly
 based his decision on that particular limb (at 1037−1039).
68     As was also observed in an article (see Andrew Phang, Cheng Lim Saw and Gary Chan, “Of Precedent, Theory and Practice – The Case for a Return to 
Anns
” [2006] SJLS 1 (at p 54)):
[D]espite the doctrinal separation of both limbs in the 
Anns
 test [which was adopted in 
Spandeck
 (see above at 
[29]
)], there would, at the level of appli­cation, nevertheless be an interaction between them. This is only to be expected since the Court concerned has to base its final decision on a 
holistic
 consideration of 
both
 limbs as applied to the facts of the case itself. [emphasis in original]
69     The overlap just referred to is, in fact, neatly illustrated by the facts of this particular appeal. In this case, the Respondent is suggesting that the legal relationship between the parties has been exclusively defined by contract, leaving no room for the tortious doctrine of assumption of responsibility to operate. This bears more affinity to proximity (pursuant to the first limb of the 
Spandeck
 test), which is, after all, a question of the closeness of the relationship between the parties (see 
Spandeck
 at [77]), than to far-reaching considerations of public policy (such as the notorious “floodgates” argument and the availability of insurance). However, we would observe – parenthetically – that the reasoning 
as well as
 (more importantly) the result would be the 
same
 even if we treat this particular issue under the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test. This is not, of course, surprising, given the overlap just mentioned (see also, in a similar vein, 
Spandeck
 (at [114])).
70     Returning to the Respondent’s submission, although this sort of argument defeated the claim in 
Spandeck
 and in 
Pacific Associates
, in our view, on the facts of the present appeal, it is not as compelling.
71     The mere fact that there is a pre-existing contractual relationship or backdrop between the parties should not, in itself, be sufficient to exclude a duty of care on one of them to avoid causing pure economic loss to the other (the situation is 
a fortiori
 where, as here, there is in fact 
no
 contractual relationship between the parties, but merely a contractual backdrop, in the sense that each party was in a separate contractual relationship with a third party, 
viz
, A.n.A). The true principle, in determining whether or not any contractual arrangement has this effect, should be whether or not the parties structured their contracts intending thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see the House of Lords decision of 
Henderson and others v Merrett Syndicates Ltd and others
 
[1995] 2 AC 145
 at 193–194).
72     In 
Spandeck
 and 
Pacific Associates
, the presence of an arbitration clause pointed unequivocally to the fact that the parties deliberately wished for their contractual arrangements to exclusively govern their respective liabilities, and to prevent a tortious duty of care which would cut across and be inconsistent with that contractual structure (see generally 
Spandeck
 at [98]–[102], [108]–[109] and [114]).
73     Here, however, there is no inconsistency between, on the one hand, the contract between the Appellant and A.n.A, and, on the other, a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant. Certainly, there is no evidence to suggest that the Appellant and A.n.A had deliberately organised their contractual arrangements to exclude any potential tortious liability on the part of the Respondent.
74     Hence, in the absence of any positive steps taken by the parties during the negotiation and conclusion of the contract between A.n.A and the Appellant, we are unable to see how the contractual matrix militates against the existence of a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant.
Policy considerations
Introduction
75     Given that there is sufficient proximity between the Appellant and the Respondent for a 
prima facie
 duty of care to arise, it is necessary to consider whether any reasons of policy militate against the imposition of a duty of care.
76     There are a number of such policy considerations, 
viz
:
(a)     whether imposing a duty of care on the Respondent might circumvent the prescribed statutory duties of a site supervisor;
(b)     whether imposing a duty of care on the Respondent might amount to an impermissible lifting of the corporate veil; and
(c)     the Respondent’s conflicts of interest.
We will deal with each of these considerations seriatim. However, it is appropriate to make one preliminary observation.
77     With regard to consideration (c) above, it will be seen (at 
[87]
 below) that our conclusion thereon is that, far from negating the Respondent’s 
prima facie
 duty of care, this particular consideration in fact 
reinforces
 it. It should not be thought, however, that this represents a departure from 
Spandeck
, and a return to the three-part test (“the 
Caparo
 test”) in 
Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
 (“
Caparo
”). The second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test is essentially 
negative
 in nature. Put simply, the court, having determined that a 
prima facie
 duty of care has been established, applies policy considerations to the factual matrix to decide whether that 
prima facie
 duty is 
negated or limited
. In contrast, the third limb of the 
Caparo
 test is a 
positive
 one: notwithstanding the existence of sufficient foreseeability of damage and proximity between the parties, a duty of care nonetheless cannot arise unless and until the factual matrix is “one in which the court considers it fair, just and reasonable” to 
impose
 a duty (see 
Caparo
 at 618). In other words, unlike the third limb of the 
Caparo
 test, the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test does not require the presence of policy considerations militating in favour of the imposition of a duty of care (“positive policy considerations”) – it merely requires the absence of policy considerations militating against the imposition of such a duty (“negative policy considerations”). We gratefully adopt the explanation of the difference between the two approaches supplied by Mark Lunney and Ken Oliphant, 
Tort Law: Text and Materials
 (Oxford University Press, 3rd ed, 2008) (at p 141):
The difference may aptly be characterised as one between an approach that starts from a presumption of duty, and requires the invocation of policy factors if the duty is to be negated, and one that starts from a presumption of no duty, and requires the invocation of policy factors if a new duty is to be established (see 
Stovin v Wise
 
[1996] AC 923
 at 949, per Lord Hoffmann).
Although it has been questioned whether the difference between the 
Spandeck
 and 
Caparo
 approaches is truly as stark as the above passage suggests (see John Murphy, 
Street on Torts
 (Oxford University Press, 12th ed, 2007) at pp 43–44), for present purposes we would merely observe that this difference in approach does 
not
 mean that courts cannot, under the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 test, have due regard to the presence of positive policy considerations. While the 
Spandeck
 test does not require this, it does not prohibit it either, for courts may sometimes need to deploy such countervailing positive policy considerations in order to dismiss spurious negative policy considerations raised by the defendant (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of 
Amutha Valli d/o Krishnan v Titular Superior of the Redemptorist Fathers in Singapore and others
 
[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1091
, where just such an exercise was undertaken by Lee Seiu Kin J at [81]). As this court stated in 
Spandeck
 (at [85]):
The courts must, as far as possible, avoid giving the impression that there remain “unexpressed motives” behind their finding for or against a duty.
78     With this preliminary point settled, we turn now to consider the relevant policy considerations, both negative and positive, in this appeal.
Statutory duty
79     One possible negative policy argument is that the duties of a site supervisor are clearly set out in s 10 of the Act, and therefore if (as in this case) the actions of a site supervisor or clerk of works fall outside the ambit of s 10, this might indicate that the Legislature did not intend for them to owe any duties in respect of such actions, and that the courts should not therefore seek to superimpose a common law duty of care wider than the statutory duty imposed by s 10, which would (on such reasoning) contradict such legislative intention in the process.
80     Such an argument found favour with the House of Lords in 
Murphy v Brentwood District Council
 
[1991] 1 AC 398
 (“
Murphy
”) at 457, 472, 482, 491–492 and 498, where the House of Lords overruled 
Anns and others v Merton London Borough Council
 
[1978] 1 AC 728
 (“
Anns
”) and held that a local authority owed no duty of care to avoid negligently approving the purchase of houses with defective foundations, which would thereby cause a purchaser of a house to incur pure economic loss. A number of their Lordships considered that, in what was essentially a consumer protection field, the precise extent and limits that should be imposed on builders and local authorities in the public interest was best dealt with by the Legislature and not the courts. As the UK Parliament had seen fit to enact the Defective Premises Act 1972 (c 35) (“the UK DPA 1972”), which imposed on builders a liability falling short of that imposed by 
Anns
, there was no policy reason for the courts to impose a higher common law duty on builders or local authorities.
81     On closer scrutiny, however, the argument based on s 10 of the Act is not, in our view, strong enough to prevent the imposition of a duty of care on the Respondent. First, the preamble to the UK DPA 1972 states quite clearly that it is:
An Act to 
impose duties
 in connection with the provision of dwellings and otherwise to 
amend the law
 of England and Wales as to liability for injury or damage caused to persons through defects in the state of premises. [emphasis added]
Further, s 1 of the UK DPA 1972 sets out in fairly substantial detail the persons to whom the duty is owed (s 1(1)(
a
) and (
b
)); the nature of the duty (s 1(1)); how the duty may be discharged (s 1(2) and (3)); and the persons on whom the duty is imposed (s 1(1) and (4)). In contrast, s 10 of the Act does not obviously create a private cause of action that sounds in damages (see 
[24]
 above). It would appear that a breach of s 10 of the Act results instead in purely criminal sanctions under sub-sections (7) to (9). In such circumstances, and given the rather general terms in which s 10 of the Act is phrased, it is unlikely that the Legislature had intended, when enacting s 10, to preclude common law civil remedies against negligent site supervisors or clerks of works. Second, the fact that the Act does not cover a particular situation is equally, if not more, consistent with the possibility that there is a lacuna in the law the courts should remedy, as opposed to the possibility that the Legislature intended for such a situation to be completely unregulated by the common law. Indeed, nothing in the debates during the Second Reading of the Building Control Bill indicates that the Legislature intended there not to be a civil remedy against negligent site supervisors (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (16 February 1989) vol 52 at cols 668–686). Third, the question of what common law duties a clerk of works owes is not merely one of “consumer protection”, but is also one of public safety, especially in the local context, where construction takes place on an ongoing basis. In the field of public and workplace safety, there is no reason why the courts should not be astute to introduce minimum standards of skill and care via the tort of negligence.
82     For all these reasons, we consider that 
Murphy
 may be distinguished, and that s 10 of the Act, in itself, is not inconsistent with the Respondent owing the Appellant a duty of care at common law.
Lifting of the corporate veil
83     The Respondent also argues that the imposition of a duty of care in this case would in effect amount to an unwarranted lifting of the corporate veil.
84     This would only be true, however, if the Respondent was being sued for the tortious acts or omissions of A.n.A, rather than for his own tort (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of 
Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corpn and others (Nos 2 and 4)
 
[2003] 1 AC 959
 at [22] (
per
 Lord Hoffmann) and [40] (
per
 Lord Rodger)). As 
Company Directors: Duties, Liabilities and Remedies
 (Simon Mortimore ed) (Oxford University Press, 2009) states (at para 27.22):
A director is personally liable for his own torts committed in relation to the company’s affairs, whilst acting as a director or employee of the company. In such circumstances the company will also be vicariously liable for the director’s torts.
In other words, the corporate veil argument depends on the Respondent acting as A.n.A, rather than as its employee or agent (or indeed in a personal capacity). On the facts of the present appeal, however, the Respondent’s liability is not predicated on any corporate acts 
qua
 organ of A.n.A, but on his personal acts 
qua
 clerk of works (albeit therefore as an employee of A.n.A (see above at 
[5]
)). If all the elements of the tort of negligence can be established against the Respondent, he will be personally liable, and the fact that he is also a director of a company is irrelevant to his personal liability, although it may be relevant to the company’s vicarious liability, depending on whether (as here) the tort was committed in the director’s course of employment.
85     In the circumstances, therefore, the separate legal personality of A.n.A is irrelevant, and a duty of care cannot be denied on that ground.
Conflicts of interest
86     One final positive policy consideration that points 
in favour of
 the imposition of a duty of care, and which merits special notice on the specific facts of this appeal, is the lack of checks and balances arising out of the Respondent’s conflicts of interest.
87     We have already adverted to the Respondent’s dual position as director of A.n.A and clerk of works (see above at 
[4]
, 
[63]
 and 
[64]
), which would inevitably have compromised his ability to scrutinise the work of A.n.A and act in the Appellant’s interest (as he ought to have done as clerk of works). Not for nothing, after all, has the virtue of “integrity” been considered a core attribute of a clerk of works (see 
[41]
 above). Clerks of works should not be allowed to flout the system of checks and balances envisioned by the Act, to the detriment of their clients, without the latter having some form of recourse.
Conclusion on duty of care
88     For all these reasons, the 
Spandeck
 test is satisfied, and we are of the view that the Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care at common law.
Whether the Respondent breached his duty of care to the Appellant
89     Given that the Respondent was under a common law duty of care to the Appellant, it is necessary to consider whether, on the facts, this duty was breached. This raises, in turn, the issue as to what the 
scope
 of that duty is, for, if the duty does not even include or encompass the matters complained of, then there is no duty to breach. This will obviously depend heavily on the specific fact situation of each case and will include such factors as the contractual duties, if any, that the clerk of works concerned has undertaken.
90     On the facts of the present appeal, it is clear, in our views, that, 
qua
 clerk of works, the Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care to supervise the backfilling works, which was undoubtedly an operational matter under the responsibility of the Respondent. This is because, as originally agreed, the levelling of the land was to be a relatively minor part of the contract, and was the product of negotiations and agreement between the Appellant and A.n.A, without any architectural input whatever. Although it is a question of fact in each case whether a matter is one of operation, as opposed to design, it is quite impossible to regard the backfilling in this case as a design element, unlike the concreting in 
Trollope
 or the tiling works in 
Setron
, especially when, as matters subsequently transpired, the backfilling operation was an unauthorised adventure on the part of A.n.A (see further at 
[93]
 below).
91     Also, as this court held in 
JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 460
 (at [69]), in determining whether there has been a breach of a duty of care, the standard of reasonable care is to be objectively assessed on the basis of knowledge then reasonably available.
92     Although the Respondent attempted to draw a sharp distinction between what he knew in his capacity as director of A.n.A, and what he knew as clerk of works, we regard this distinction as somewhat unreal. This sort of approach has been rejected in the context of directors’ fiduciary duties (see, for example, the English High Court decision of 
Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley Ltd
. 
[1972] 1 WLR 443
 at 451 and the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Mohan Singh Bhullar & ors v Inderjit Singh Bhullar & anor
 [2003] EWCA Civ 424 at [41]), and we see no reason to adopt it in the context of the common law duties of a clerk of works.
93     Consequently, the knowledge reasonably available to the Respondent 
qua
 clerk of works was also the knowledge available to him 
qua
 director of A.n.A, which included the following matters:
(a)     As the site was not level, the Appellant’s contract with A.n.A envisioned that A.n.A was to level the land (see the Judgment at [16]) by using surplus earth from the higher-lying areas to raise the lower-lying areas (see the Judgment at [3]–[4]). The levelling operation was therefore supposed to be a “self-contained” job, involving no external elements.
(b)     Instead, A.n.A departed from the terms of the agreement by engaging Lok Sheng to truck in backfill material consisting of wet soil and wood chips from off-site to raise the lower-lying areas of the site (see the Judgment at [17]).
(c)     A.n.A did not know if Lok Sheng had any special qualifications in the area of earthworks (see the Judgment at [17]). During the course of the trial, it emerged that Lok Sheng’s principal business activities consisted of “construction and engineering” and “freight transport by road” – a far cry from the “specialist” in earthworks it was asserted to be by both A.n.A and the Respondent in their pleadings and affidavits. In addition, as the Judge observed, Lok Sheng was “a one-man operation” (see the Judgment at [17]).
(d)     In the contract between A.n.A and Lok Sheng under which Lok Sheng was to supply the soil and wood chips as backfill material, there were no specifications regarding the type and/or quality of soil and wood chips to be provided. The contract was completely silent as to whether, for example, the wood chips were to be chemically treated or inert, or whether the soil was to consist of organic or inorganic material (or both), or whether precautions had been taken to ensure the absence of contaminants.
(e)     A.n.A did not have to pay for the backfill material (see the Judgment at [17]), and in fact appears to have received $40,000 in “compensation” from Lok Sheng for transport and labour costs allegedly incurred by A.n.A in facilitating the supply and delivery by Lok Sheng of the wood chips. Whether A.n.A actually incurred any such costs is open to question, given the testimony of Choo Kong Leong (A.n.A’s project manager), that there were in fact 
no
 extra costs incurred in bringing in the backfill material. In any event, even if any such costs had been incurred, the fact of the matter is that A.n.A received the backfill material from Lok Sheng for free (see the Judgment at [17]). Indeed, under these circumstances, the Respondent ought, in our view, to have realised that something was amiss – particularly having regard to the dubious circumstances under which the wood chips were brought onto the site and used as backfill material. It bears repeating that these circumstances resulted in A.n.A being able to level the land with at minimal or no cost, utilising material (here, wood chips) which Lok Sheng was only too eager to offload free-of-charge. Indeed, as we have already noted, Lok Sheng appears to have paid $40,000 in “compensation” to A.n.A as well.
94     Given the circumstances set out above, a reasonably competent and prudent clerk of works, knowing of all these matters, would have taken special care and redoubled his efforts in supervising the backfilling and checking that the backfill material used by Lok Sheng was suitable. At the very least, he would have informed the QPs (and, more importantly, the Appellant) that A.n.A was backfilling the site in a manner not contemplated by the contract (see 
[93]
 above), as well as of all the other matters in the preceding paragraph. In short, it was the Respondent’s duty, as clerk of works, to act in a manner which was contrary to his interests as director of A.n.A.
95     The Respondent, however, did none of these things. There is no evidence that he took any steps to ensure that the wood chips were safe backfill material and would not contaminate the site, nor is there evidence that the QPs had been informed of the backfilling. Indeed, the Respondent himself admitted in cross-examination that, had the QE been informed of the backfilling, the QE would have applied for a permit from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”), as the backfilling involved a land area of more than 2,000m
2
 and a change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m relative to the neighbouring land, and Condition 10 of the “Permit to Carry Out Structural Works” granted by the BCA to the Appellant required:
A separate planning permission … from the Chief Planner, URA for earthworks at a remote site if the works for which this permit is granted also involve:
(a) the borrowing or filling of earth at the remote site; and
(b) such borrowing/filling of earth at the remote site involves a land area of more than 2,000m
2
 or a change in level of land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the site relative to the neighbouring land.
It is not disputed that, notwithstanding this requirement, no planning permission was applied for prior to the commencement of the backfilling.
96     It should be added that, throughout this entire unhappy affair (
ie
, both before and during the trial, as well as at the hearing of the present appeal), the Respondent has repeatedly prevaricated and changed his story with regard to the provenance of the wood chips, attempting to suggest that they had been used on the access way of the site to provide traction for vehicles entering and leaving the site, and had been “accidentally buried” when they should have been removed at the end of the project (see, for example, the Judgment at [18]). These blatant attempts at evasion and dissemblance lead to the inevitable inference that the Respondent knew full well that A.n.A had no authorisation from the Appellant to use the wood chips as backfill, and was going to all possible lengths to hide the fact that A.n.A had gone off on a frolic of its own in engaging Lok Sheng to backfill the site.
97     In the circumstances, by reason of his failure to supervise the backfilling operation and to report it to the QPs, the Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant.
Causation and remoteness
98     It is clear that, but for the Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant would not have suffered the loss it has. Had proper supervision been observed, it is more likely than not that soil and wood chips would not have been used as the backfill material. More importantly, had the QPs (or the Appellant) been informed of the unauthorised backfilling, they would very likely have put a stop to it. In addition, they would have applied for the necessary permit from the URA; and if that had been done, it is unlikely that the URA would have granted the permit in the absence of the SLA’s consent, and the SLA would not have consented because cl 6.11 of the Tenancy Agreement between the Appellant and the SLA obliged the former “[n]ot to dispose earth, debris or any other material” on the site.
99     With regard to the issue of remoteness, we do not consider the Appellant’s loss too remote for the purposes of the Respondent’s liability in negligence. The test for remoteness of damage in the tort of negligence is that of “reasonable foreseeability”, 
ie
, a tortfeasor is liable only for damage of a kind which a reasonable man should have foreseen (see the leading Privy Council decision of 
Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)
 
[1961] AC 388
, as well as the decisions of this court in 
Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank
 
[2007] 2 SLR(R) 181
 at [39] and 
Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric
 
[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782
 at [56]). It was perfectly foreseeable that, if reasonable care was not taken by the Respondent in supervising the backfilling, ensuring that the backfill material was suitable and reporting the backfilling to the QPs, pure economic loss would have been caused to the Appellant in having to demolish any structures resting on the affected areas in order to excavate and replace the backfill.
100    Quite apart from this, as a result of the Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant has had to suffer the unnecessary stress and inconvenience of having to deal with a number of government agencies regarding the environmental damage from the contaminated backfill, delay the opening of the shelter and the commencement of the good work the shelter was intended for, as well as put up with the unsightly and noxious effluence being discharged from the site. While these may not be legally recoverable losses, it is a testament to the fortitude and determination of the Appellant’s staff that they were not deterred by these numerous setbacks.
Defences
101    We did not hear any argument on this issue, but we are of the view that the Respondent cannot avail himself of any defences to the Appellant’s claim in negligence.
102    As we observed at 
[90]
 above, we regard the backfilling as an operational matter falling under the supervisory responsibility of the clerk of works. The QPs were entitled to expect the Respondent to carry out his duties diligently and to keep them informed if for some reason their attention was required on site. That being so, we do not think it can be said that the QPs have, in this case, been guilty of contributory negligence.
Conclusion
103    For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant, and that, by reason of his negligence, he caused the Appellant to suffer pure economic loss. The Appellant’s appeal is therefore allowed with costs and with the usual consequential orders. The damages to be awarded to the Appellant are to be assessed by the Registrar.",2011-01-20 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Adams J.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 6 November 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three offences: first, that on 28 November 2012 he supplied cocaine having a total weight of 2.75 ounces; secondly, between 29 February and 28 November 2012 he supplied more than an indictable and less than the commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (head); and, thirdly, between 9am and 12pm on 28 November 2012 he dealt with $21,400 knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The first two offences were contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), carrying maximum penalties respectively of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units, and 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. The last offence was contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	When the applicant appeared in the District Court for sentence, he asked that three offences should be taken into account on a Form 1: possessing 1 tablet of methylene dioxymethamphetamine (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); possessing two vials of a steroid, a prescribed restricted substance (s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW), maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); and possession of four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds, a prohibited drug (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment).
	
	
	On 6 June 2014, the applicant was sentenced as follows: for the proceeds of crime offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 28 November 2012; for the supply cocaine offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 28 November 2012; and, for the supply cannabis offence (taking into account the matters on a Form 1), a sentence of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 28 November 2012. A discount of 25 per cent was allowed for his early plea.
	
	
	The primary judge sentenced the applicant for the cannabis offence upon the mistaken basis that the applicable maximum term of imprisonment was 15 years. This error, conceded by the Crown, means that the sentence for this offence cannot stand. It is not controversial that this Court must itself consider the appropriate sentence for this offence and, if a lesser sentence is warranted in law, substitute that lesser sentence.
	


The facts


	
	These were not disputed. The following account is taken from the statement of agreed facts.
	
	
	On 28 November 2012 police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s house. When they arrived, officers asked the applicant if there was anything in the house, to which he responded, “it’s all on the bed. You’ll see it”. In the bedroom, the police found 17 clear plastic resealable plastic bags containing cannabis. In the kitchen they found more cannabis, stored inside a cupboard as well as in a vacuum sealed package in the spare room. Together, the cannabis weighed 8.7kg. Police located also a large storage bag in the garage containing 80 empty vacuum bags smelling strongly of cannabis. The applicant told police that some of these bags had previously contained cannabis that he had either sold or used personally over the previous eight months. He indicated that the bags would have contained from between two and eight pounds but that, at times, they would be double or triple bagged to conceal the strong odour. The agreed facts noted that, using the lowest weight provided by the applicant, on the assumption that all of the bags were double bags, the total quantity of cannabis was 36kg. Allowing for the applicant’s claim that he had used some of it, the applicant would have supplied close to 25kg of cannabis over the preceding eight months. This was said in the agreed facts to relate to count one. However, whilst the facts certainly concede the supply of cannabis beyond the quantity found in his possession of 8.7kg, it is clear that the calculation assumed facts which were not admitted. Firstly, the applicant only admitted that “some of these bags had previously contained cannabis” and that “at times they would either be double or triple bagged”. But this is not an admission that all the bags were used. A fact which is adverse to an offender cannot be based upon an assumption. It may be established beyond reasonable doubt by evidence or admission but an admission as to a calculation based on an assumption which is not admitted is clearly insufficient. Furthermore, in respect of cannabis leaf, the indictable quantity is 1kg whilst the commercial quantity is 25kg. The 8.7kg of cannabis in the applicant’s possession at the time of his arrest together with “close to 25kg of cannabis” suggested to have been supplied during the period comprehended by the charge would have amounted to a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, which was not alleged. It seems to me that the appropriate approach for present purposes to this issue is to sentence the applicant upon the basis that he had 8.7kg of cannabis in possession at the time of his arrest, mostly but not all for the purpose of supply (he was a heavy user) and that he would have supplied a significant but unknown quantity of cannabis leaf during the previous eight months. He cannot be sentenced on the basis that he had either in his possession for supply or had in fact supplied as much as 25kg.
	
	
	Returning to the facts, the applicant directed police to search the kitchen, where they located 12 resealable bags, one of which contained an ecstasy tablet, whilst inside the fridge police also located two vials of steroid medication and, inside a built in wardrobe in the spare room, four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds (otherwise not quantified). Possession of these substances comprised the three charges on the Form 1. Also in the kitchen the applicant directed police to a plastic bag containing cocaine in a corner cupboard. This, together with two small knotted bags of cocaine found in the wardrobe in his bedroom totalled 74.6g of cocaine at 65 per cent purity and constituted the second charge. Police found wads of cash of $15,000 and $6,400 in two separate bags in the bedside table of the applicant’s bedroom, the applicant admitting that this was the proceeds of the sales of drugs. This constituted charge three.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested, taken into custody, and ultimately participated in an electronically recorded interview confirming the admissions he had made during the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	On 16 October 2012 he had committed the offence of driving whilst disqualified and, on 26 March 2013 (whilst he was in custody on the present charges) he was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 28 November 2012. Accordingly, as the primary judge observed, the applicant had been in custody in respect of the drug offences alone since 27 May 2013.
	


Subjective features


	
	These are not controversial. The applicant is now 38 years of age. His criminal record was characterised by the primary judge as “minor” comprising convictions for driving whilst disqualified, stating a false name, exceeding the speed limit, affray, obtaining money by deception, displaying unauthorised number plates, driving whilst licence suspended, using an uninsured and unregistered motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. So far as the sentence of imprisonment for the offence of driving whilst disqualified is concerned, the learned primary judge considered that a gaol sentence may well not have been imposed had he not been in custody for the present charges. Mr Barrow, counsel for the applicant in this Court, points out that his previous offence was three years earlier and, but for his being bail refused on the present charges, a non-custodial disposition could well have resulted but was not available as he was in custody. The Crown submits that he would likely have been sentenced to imprisonment at all events. In my view this Court should approach the matter in the same way as did the primary judge.
	
	
	Tendered on the sentence proceedings was a drug and alcohol report prepared by Corrective Services. It noted that the applicant scored “extremely high in the range which requires more intensive treatment in some domains specifically around his cannabis and cocaine use”. It noted his strong desire to address his alcohol and drug use and had expressed an interest in attending a rehabilitation program within the community. Programs are available within the custodial setting, providing he is assessed as suitable for them. A report from Mr Bradley Jones, a forensic psychologist, was also tendered. The history in that report was used as a basis for the primary judge’s consideration of his background. The following is drawn from her Honour’s reasons for sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was raised in a family of African descent although he, himself, is Caucasian. He was born in Australia and his mother moved to Tanzania, ultimately returning to Australia when he was aged four years. He enjoyed a stable and loving upbringing and speaks highly of his mother, a devout Catholic and his stepfather. He completed year 10 at school and went on to complete a mechanic’s course, undertaking an apprenticeship in a repair shop. Thereafter he worked for a number of mechanics and commenced his own business which, however, failed after he lost his license as a result of driving offences. The applicant commenced consuming alcohol at the age of 18 and to abuse marijuana when he was 22. His consumption of this drug increased significantly over the next 12 years. He has experimented with ecstasy and has also been a heavy user of cocaine. He experienced a significant trauma when, in 1999, one of his stepbrothers petrol bombed the residence where he and another brother were staying and both men suffered significant emotional distress and physical injuries as a result. Following the petrol bombing and the loss of his business, his drug addiction increased significantly. He had been receiving psychological treatment for some four years before his arrest but continues to suffer flashbacks and nightmares. The report notes that the applicant has expressed shame and regret at his offending behaviour saying, “I was blinded by drugs, I’m glad I was caught, I was over the top”. In the opinion of the psychologist, the applicant suffers from anxiety and depression and needs cognitive behavioural therapy, drug release prevention counselling, cognitive training and monitoring upon his release from custody by the Community Corrections Service. The psychologist considered that he has insight into the basis of his offending behaviour, his maladaptive thought processes and his depression and noted his willingness to engage in a treatment program. He has established a connection with the chaplaincy service at the correctional centres where he has been held and appears to have been doing well in prison, engaging with the drug and alcohol counsellor and undertaking studies which will be useful on his release.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest the applicant was in a relationship and has a four year old child from that relationship.
	
	
	It is a significant matter to be taken into account that, were it not for the applicant’s admissions that he had been supplying cannabis over something like eight months before his arrest and his candid estimate of the quantity involved, it would have been virtually impossible for the Crown to prove the extent of his criminal activities over and above what was found in his possession, although no doubt it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that he had been trading in an unknown quantity in addition to that found in his possession. The primary judge considered that the applicant’s criminal antecedents, as I have mentioned, were relatively minor and did not disentitle him to leniency. Her Honour also concluded that he was truly remorseful and contrite but his prospects for rehabilitation were guarded because of the extent of his addictions. She considered that the applicant was in need of intensive rehabilitation for a lengthy period if he were to become and remain law abiding. I agree with these conclusions which were not, at all events, really disputed. The need for a long period of supervised parole justifies a finding of special circumstances warranting a variation of the calculus prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The scale of drug supply is obviously significant and naturally focuses attention on the amount of cannabis involved. I have already discussed the difficulties in determining this quantity. It is fair to say, as the Crown submitted, that his supply was not an isolated event and could not be regarded as a temporary aberration. The supply of significant quantities of cannabis is plainly a serious offence, marked by the maximum term of imprisonment its commission attracts. It took place over a period of eight months and produced at least the cash which was found in the applicant’s possession on his arrest. The objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence is significant but very far short of the worst case. Since, essentially, he is to be sentenced in respect of the marijuana offence for selling drugs, it appears to me to be double counting to punish him additionally for dealing with the proceeds of those sales. That the primary judge made the sentence for that offence wholly concurrent with the supply of marijuana charge is not surprising and this Court should take the same approach.
	


The other offences


	
	It was submitted by the Crown in this Court that there should be a degree of accumulation in respect of the cannabis and cocaine charges, pointing to Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285 in which the applicant was convicted of the deemed supply of 19.72g of crystalline methylamphetamine and 7.29g of heroin. The Court observed –
	


“[32] Possession of the two different kinds of drugs giving rise to the ‘deemed supply’ offences is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality. There were two deemed supplies, as there would be two (or more) actual supplies were the different drugs to be sold to two (or more) purchasers in the course of the applicant’s drug dealing ...”

(The appellant in that case had also been found in the possession of a prohibited and an unregistered pistol.) Dealing with the drug offences, the sentence imposed for the heroin offence was 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months and, for the crystalline methylamphetamine offence, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. They were accumulated by 6 months. It is apparent that the Court did not consider this accumulation as suggestive of error.


	
	It is relevant to note, in respect of the overall quantity of cocaine, that the history he gave to the psychologist, which was not sought to be disputed either below or in this Court, was that the applicant had commenced consuming cocaine for about two years before the offence, rising to 7g daily. The cocaine, which he was deemed to have in possession for supply, was not an insignificant quantity and it is appropriate to accumulate the sentence for this offence to some degree on the sentence to be imposed in respect of the supplying marijuana.
	
	
	So far as the Form 1 offences are concerned, it seems to me virtually certain that, either individually or taken together, they would not have resulted in a custodial sentence. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to add a period of custody in respect of them. Nor do they indicate anything of significance in relation to the substantive offences.
	


Assessment


	
	Mr Barrow brought to the Court’s attention the Judicial Commission’s statistics for supply of less than a commercial quantity of cannabis. Although the sample is reasonably high (87 cases), since it is not known what proportion of these involve a quantity of drugs greater than the indictable quantity, let alone the quantities themselves, they are not of much use. The statistics of cases involving the supply of a commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (which of course must be regarded as much more serious, having a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years), involve 24 cases. Only 58 per cent of these offences attracted prison sentences, which is rather surprising. In 14 cases, the sentences ranged between 2 years and 4 years, 6 months. Although we were given the figures for non-parole periods, I do not think these are at all useful, given the very wide range of special circumstances that might or might not have been applied. The statistics are informative at a somewhat doubtful level of significance. A number of particular cases were also referred to but I do not regard them as presently useful and it is unnecessary to discuss them further.
	
	
	In my view the appropriate commencing point for sentencing the applicant in respect of the cannabis offence is 5 years and 6 months which, with a 25 per cent discount, yields an overall sentence of 4 years and 9 months. It is in the public interest as well in that of the applicant to find (as did the primary judge) that special circumstances justify varying what I have called the statutory calculus to provide for an extended period of supervision, which the applicant will need if he is to maintain an appropriate level of treatment for his drug addiction. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The offence for the proceeds of crime should be wholly concurrent with the other sentences. The cannabis supply offence should in my view be accumulated by four months on the cocaine supply offence. I therefore propose the following orders –
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Set aside the sentences imposed by the District Court on 6 June 2014, in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows:
	



	
	for the supply of cocaine on 28 November 2012, a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 28 November 2012 and expiring on 27 November 2014;
	
	
	for the supply of cannabis leaf between 29 February 2012 and 28 November 2012 (taking into account the offences on the Form 1) a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 28 March 2013 and expiring on 27 September 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 28 September 2015 and expiring on 27 December 2017; and
	
	
	for the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime a term of imprisonment of twelve months commencing on 28 March 2013.
	
	
	The first date upon which the appellant is eligible to be considered for parole is 27 September 2015.

87,2708715,"McLEAN, Michael v R [2011] NSWCCA 273","Judgment 

1THE COURT : On 20 July 2011, the Court made orders allowing the appellant's appeal, setting aside his conviction and directing an acquittal. These are the reasons for those orders. 

2The appellant was tried by a jury before a judge of the District Court at Parramatta between 31 August and 10 September 2009, on a single count of robbery whilst in the company of unknown persons contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 97(1). 

3He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and four months with a non-parole period of four years and four months. 

4The ground of the appeal was that the trial miscarried as the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1). 

5There was no issue as to the operative legal principle to apply to dispose of the appeal. Whilst the Court has due regard to both the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence and the primacy of the jury verdict, it makes its own independent assessment of the quality and sufficiency of the whole of the evidence at the trial and determines for itself whether there was a reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the appellant: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 571 at [11]-[14], [20]-[25], [37], [40]-[48] and [78]-[80]; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487. 

6The relevant facts from and concerning the trial can be shortly stated as follows. At about 3.50 pm on 24 March 2009, Easter Monday afternoon, three men attended Medusa Jewellers on Church Street at Parramatta. One man stood outside the store, while the two other males entered, having been admitted by the owner Mr Nathan Sobbi who released the door lock. Mr Sobbi's evidence was that while examining jewellery one of the two offenders in the shop lifted his shirt to reveal a gun. Mr Sobbi was directed to comply with directions of this man to open the display cabinets. He was then taken to the back of the store, where the safes were opened. This man demanded the CCTV recordings which were given to him. Mr Sobbi was then tied up. Some time later, he set off an alarm and rang the police. His shop had, of course, been robbed. 

7When the police arrived swabs were taken from arm marks on the glass counter. 

8The appellant had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from one of the swabs at the scene. 

9There are a number of aspects of the evidence which persuaded us that there was a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt. 

10The first aspect was the description of the two men. The man who showed the gun to Mr Sobbi was said to be of ""Australian"" appearance and to have a tattoo on his neck. The appellant does not have a tattoo on his neck. The second man was said to be wearing an Hawaiian shirt with short sleeves and sunglasses. No mention was made of any tattoos. The appellant has prominent tattoos on his forearms. Mr Sobbi, who is Persian, also described the second man in the shop as ""Middle Eastern, could be Lebanese people or Egyptian or Persian people"". He described the third man outside similarly. The appellant is not of those ethnic descriptions. 

11Thus, not only was there no identification evidence implicating the appellant at the store in the company of the two other men at the time of the robbery, but also such evidence as there was raised a doubt as to the likelihood of the appellant being one of the men. 

12The DNA evidence was the only evidence linking the accused with the crime. Whilst the appellant's counsel put detailed written submissions on DNA evidence, his argument on appeal ultimately did not challenge the reliability of the scientific evidence. There is no call, therefore, to deal with any of the cases on DNA evidence. 

13It was necessary therefore for the balance of the evidence to be sufficient to leave no reasonable doubt that the DNA was left by the appellant in the shop during the robbery. 

14Three bodies of evidence were relevant to this factual issue: the record of interview of the appellant with the police, the evidence of the cleaning of the glass counter by Mr Sobbi on which the swab was found, and the evidence of who may have entered the shop that day and in days before. 

15The interview was conducted some ten months after the robbery. It is unnecessary to set out the whole of the relevant terms of the interview. Crucial to the case of the prosecution was the obtaining of a clear denial by the appellant that he had ever been in this shop. An edited version of the ERISP and the DVD of the edited version were in evidence. The transcript as a whole is simply an inadequate basis to conclude that there was any clear denial ofhis being in this shop at any time. The shop was inadequately, and to a degree inaccurately, described by the police at the interview and the denial, such as it was, was equivocal. 

16We should add at this point that we raised with counsel at the appeal the possibility that the trial miscarried by inadequate representation because of what could be seen to have been agreed to be excised from the transcript exhibit. This matter did not have to be addressed because we came to the firm view that the evidence as led admitted necessarily of a reasonable doubt. 

17The evidence of Mr Sobbi as to when he cleaned the glass was connected with his evidence of trading on the day in question and of his usual practice. The shop had been closed on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday previously. During the course of a normal trading day he would clean the glass at least four times a day with window cleaner and cloth. On the day in question, he opened at 10.30 am. He would usually clean the cabinets at the beginning of the day. The evidence was not taken from any particular recollection, but from his usual practice. 

18Mr Sobbi gave evidence that there were customers that day, before the robbery. Mr Sobbi could not remember them. The evidence was insufficient to conclude that the door was locked all day. Sometimes he left it open, enabling people to walk in. 

19From this material there was no basis to conclude that the appellant did not visit the shop in the morning or early afternoon of the day in question. Though it is unlikely, given the practice of Mr Sobbi as to cleaning, it was possible that the DNA was left the previous week. Even if that can be discounted there was ample time for the appellant to have visited the shop that day. The ERISP did not, with any clarity at all, eliminate that reasonable possibility. 

20When one combines the above with the disconformities in identification - the lack of tattoo identification and the ethnicity identification, we were persuaded that the doubt about the conviction was reason

88,6455470,Nisan v R [2017] NSWCCA 265,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Schmidt J and the orders which she proposes.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In October 2014 Mr Nisan was driving a truck which was involved in a collision at the intersection of Warringah and Pittwater Roads, Dee Why. A number of people were seriously injured, including Mr Nisan. In November 2016, after a judge alone trial, Mr Nisan was convicted of two charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and acquitted of four counts of wilful neglect occasioning bodily harm: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan was later sentenced to terms of imprisonment respectively of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 4 April 2018 and 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, dating from 4 April 2017: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 27 April 2017, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan has appealed both his conviction and sentence.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case was that he had been wrongly convicted and that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive and inconsistent with the reasons earlier given by the trial judge in the conviction judgment. On appeal the grounds Mr Nisan advanced were:
	


“Conviction Appeal

1.   The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence over objection expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruller relating to brake force efficiency in circumstances where the opinions were based on assumption that could not be made out in the evidence.

2.   The trial judge erred in admitted[sic] into evidence over objection as expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruiler[sic] concerning the record of interview of the Appellant where that opinion evidence was outside the scope of his expertise.

3.   That the trial judge wrongly held that on the evidence there was no reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt and the verdicts were unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable in the circumstances.

4.   The trial judge erred in failing to give adequate reasons for her decision.

Particulars

a.   finding that when the appellant said in his record of interview ""the top of the hill"" he meant May Road and not west of Alfred Street.

b.   rejecting the evidence of Dr Hart and accepting the evidence of Mr Ruller.

c.   failing to address the submissions of the appellant relating to the credibility and reliability of Senior Constable Ben Wilson.

Severity Appeal

1.   That trial judge erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in circumstances where that assessment was inconsistent with the trial judge's verdict and reasons for verdict.

2.   That the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.”

The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	This was not a case which involved either death or deliberately dangerous conduct. It turned on whether it was brake failure, or Mr Nisan’s driving, that had caused the collision.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal the Crown conceded that the sentence imposed on Mr Nisan was very high. That concession was properly made.
	
	
	The truck was not owned by Mr Nisan, who was an employed driver. The evidence established that some of the truck’s brakes were out of adjustment and in cross-examination the Crown’s expert Mr Ruller (a crash scene investigator), said that he would not have driven the truck with the brakes in that state. There was no suggestion that Mr Nisan knew or should have known what the state of the brakes was.
	
	
	As I will come to explain, it is not entirely clear that in the conviction judgment the trial judge concluded that regardless of what conclusion was reached as to the number of brakes which were out of adjustment “the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident”. If that was not the conclusion reached, for reasons which I will explain, it ought to have been.
	
	
	If this was the trial judge’s conclusion, it is impossible to see how, consistently with that conclusion, her Honour then went on to “reject beyond reasonable doubt that brake fade was a cause of the accident”.
	
	
	Her Honour later also observed that she had “a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted in a conscious way or was conscious of his breach of the necessary standard of care” and that “[t]here is no evidence that he intended to drive in the way he did, or acted recklessly, rather than events overtaking him”.
	
	
	These findings were relevant on sentence to the assessment of the objective seriousness of Mr Nisan’s offences and his moral culpability for that offending. Despite making these findings, her Honour rejected his case that his moral culpability was low. Instead, her Honour concluded that it fell at the higher end of the scale; that the objective seriousness of his offending also fell at the higher end of the range; and that “all the circumstances demonstrate the abandonment of responsibility”.
	
	
	I am satisfied that neither those conclusions, nor the resulting sentences imposed on Mr Nisan, were properly open on the evidence received at trial and involved relevant error: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40.
	
	
	Had I come to the conclusion that the conviction appeal should be dismissed, it would thus have been necessary to uphold the sentence appeal. Given that I consider that the conviction appeal must be upheld, it is unnecessary to consider the sentence appeal further.
	


Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted


	
	The onus fell on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous. Satisfaction on the balance of probabilities, or a finding of negligence could not result in his conviction of the dangerous driving charges which were found proven.
	
	
	For reasons which I will explain more fully in relation to the grounds of appeal, I consider that Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted; that his appeal must be upheld; and that he must be acquitted of both charges.
	
	
	In her judgment, the trial judge observed that the Crown’s case was that Mr Nisan had failed to control his fully laden truck, while driving down the steep incline to the intersection – safe driving requiring him to reduce his speed sufficiently, so that he could adhere to the 20kph speed limit, which applied to trucks on the steep descent at Warringah Hill. The Crown argued that during this descent, Mr Nisan had to drive in a gear no higher than third and to engage the truck’s exhaust brake. He had failed to do so, with the result that he had driven at excessive speed in the circumstances and in too high a gear.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case was that the brakes were not roadworthy and had been poorly adjusted, making them vulnerable to brake failure or fading. That was what had caused the accident, by preventing him from slowing the truck to the 20kph speed limit, as he had attempted to do.
	
	
	There was no issue that Mr Nisan was the driver of the truck and that the applicable Road Rule 108 of the Road Rules 2008 (NSW), required that on a road where a “trucks and buses low gear sign” applies, trucks must be driven in a gear low enough to limit the speed of the truck, without the use of primary breaks.
	
	
	It was also common ground that when Mr Nisan reached the intersection, the truck was travelling at a speed of some 65kph. The evidence established that if it was driven in low range, the maximum speed of the truck was 40kph. On investigation after the collision, the truck was found to be in low range, but not in gear. Being in neutral allowed its speed to increase to 65kph, even though it was in low range.
	
	
	Mr Nisan did not give evidence at trial, but both at the scene and afterwards, he made statements to police about what had caused the collision. On his accounts, the collision occurred because the truck’s brakes had failed. Those statements were considered by the parties’ experts, Mr Ruller and Dr Hart (a qualified engineer and electrical and mechanical engineering consultant).
	
	
	Mr Cowie, an experienced truck driver who witnessed the accident and was accepted to have relevant expertise, given that experience, gave evidence about what he observed and found when he lent aid at the scene of the collision. Other experts, Constable Wilson (a mechanic) and Dr White (a forensic mechanical engineer), had tested the vehicle.
	
	
	There were many differences of opinion between the experts. Many of the critical differences lying between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart were resolved in cross-examination.
	
	
	Evidence was also called from the owner of the truck, the mechanic who had maintained the brakes and the truck’s manufacturer. From this evidence it emerged that while the brakes had been maintained, the owner had supplied the “after market” brake linings which had been used on the last occasion they were adjusted, the month prior to the collision. They were not recommended by the manufacturer, but were not tested by either Constable Wilson or Dr White, to determine whether overheating had contributed to brake failure, as was Dr Hart’s opinion.
	
	
	The expert evidence ought to have led her Honour to the conclusion that the Crown could not exclude the possibility that it was the state of the brakes which had caused the collision, rather than Mr Nisan’s driving. That was because it finally became common ground between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart, that the brakes had faded during the truck’s descent down Warringah Hill. Where that occurred was what remained in issue.
	
	
	In concluding that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, her Honour did not consider the evidence about whether the ‘after market’ brake linings had caused, or contributed to the brakes fading. That was relevant to the question of where it was that the brakes faded.
	
	
	Even so, I consider that Mr Ruller’s concession in cross-examination that the condition of the brakes was such that he would not have knowingly driven this truck and the common view of Dr Hart and Mr Ruller, that if the brakes had been working properly, they would have been capable of stopping this truck on the descent, it was not open to her Honour to find that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, or that it had caused the collision.
	


Ground 1 – admission of expert evidence based on assumptions


	
	Mr Ruller’s opinions rested on a series of identified assumptions. They included brake temperatures, on which various of his calculations were based, and what Mr Nisan had meant by some of his responses during his police interview.
	
	
	The trial judge rejected the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Dr Hart’s opinions also rested on various assumptions, including as to the brakes having overheated and what Mr Nisan had meant by his police interview responses.
	
	
	Mr Cowie’s evidence provided an objective basis for the conclusion that the brakes had overheated, given what he described smelling at the scene of the collision. Mr Ruller agreed that this indicated overheating and conceded that there was no way to verify the actual temperatures which the truck’s various brakes had reached.
	
	
	On Mr Nisan’s case on appeal, that it was not possible to establish the temperature of the brakes was fatal to the admissibility of Mr Ruller’s evidence: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705; [2001] NSWCA 305. Further, it was argued that her Honour’s reasons revealed that she had concerned herself with whether there was any basis for the defence to argue that overheating was a significant issue, in relation to the effectiveness of the brakes, rather than the admissibility of Mr Ruller’s evidence.
	
	
	In the circumstances Mr Ruller’s evidence should not have been admitted and in the absence of his opinions, the Crown’s case should have been rejected as not having established Mr Nisan’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In rejecting the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence, the trial judge noted that the only evidence of overheating of the brakes came from Mr Cowie, who said that such overheating had been suggested to him by an asbestos-type smell. In his interview with police, Mr Nisan had not said anything about having had any trouble with the brakes, up until this occasion. Her Honour also noted evidence that in normal circumstances, there would have been no heating of the brakes.
	
	
	After referring to evidence foreshadowed in the defence case and to Heydon JA’s observations in Makita at [85], her Honour concluded that Mr Ruller's opinions, while based on assumptions, were “not assumptions without having a grounding or founding in his knowledge and expertise and, in my view, he is entitled to give the estimates he has given”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep) at 3.
	
	
	Makita was considered in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588; [2011] HCA 21. What was there decided has since been repeatedly considered by this Court. Recently in Taub v R [2017] NSWCCA 198, Simpson JA observed, for example:
	


“27    The plurality in Dasreef refined Heydon JA’s seven admissibility criteria in Makita to two:


	
	that the witness who gives the evidence “has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience”; and
	
	
	that the opinion expressed in the evidence by the witness “is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge” ([32]).
	


28    What was in issue in Dasreef was whether the opinion expressed by the witness proffered as an expert was based on the witness’ specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience.

29    The plurality added (citing [85] of Makita) that:

“… ordinarily … ‘the expert’s evidence must explain how the field of ‘specialised knowledge’ in which the witness is expert by reason of ‘training, study or experience’, and on which the opinion is ‘wholly or substantially based’, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded’.” ([37])

30    This, it appears to me, states a third criterion of admissibility. Their Honours then emphasised (at [42]) that satisfaction of the criteria is a matter that goes to the admissibility of, not the weight to be attributed to, the opinion evidence.

31    The plurality declined to engage with the question whether the “proof of assumption rule” (what their Honours called “the basis rule”) existed at common law; such a rule, their Honours said, was directed to the facts of a particular case. From that it might be inferred that their Honours considered that whether the facts upon which the opinion was based are established as true is a question that goes not to admissibility, but to the weight to be attributed to the opinion expressed. This is also the analysis of Schmidt J in Kyluk Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage (2013) 298 ALR 532; [2013] NSWCCA 114 at [176]-[177].

32    It seems to me that the difference between Heydon J and the plurality lies in the rigour with which Heydon J would insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth, or correctness, of the assumptions or facts forming the foundation of the opinion as a condition of admissibility and at the time admissibility is being considered. It is not the position of Heydon J that, before evidence of the opinion could be admitted, it was necessary that the assumptions or facts be proved to be true or correct; rather, it was necessary that it be shown that ultimately the evidence would be capable of establishing that the facts or assumptions were true or correct. To insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth of the assumptions enhances efficiency of the trial process (see [127]). Whether the evidence succeeds in establishing the truth of the facts is a question for the trier of fact.

33    The plurality, on the other hand, would allow admission of the opinion evidence provided the reasoning was exposed, reserving to the tribunal of fact whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the truth or correctness of the assumptions or facts. Failure to prove the truth of the assumptions would render the opinion evidence of little or no value.”


	
	It follows that the trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s evidence. If, however, at trial the Crown failed to prove the assumptions on which Mr Ruller’s opinions rested, they would be of little or no value, in establishing the Crown case, as her Honour observed in the conviction judgment.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Ruller’s evidence, the trial judge noted, for example, that he had used the wrong graph in coming to conclusions about the power of the exhaust brake. Her Honour did not conclude that his opinion about this was of little or no value, because it had no foundation, as the trial judge had earlier indicated would be her approach. She observed, however, that this “undermines” Mr Ruller: see R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 21.
	
	
	Her Honour also referred to Mr Ruller’s concessions that a critical assumption he had made about the brake temperature could not be verified; that the front brakes had been poorly adjusted; and that there had been brake fade, albeit in his view, near the end of the descent on Warringah Hill. Despite this, and without referring to the evidence she had earlier noted Dr Hart had given about the ‘after market’ brake linings contributing to the overheating of the brakes and their fading, her Honour accepted Mr Ruller’s opinion that “the brakes, albeit not perfect, were not determinative of the events”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32. This approach did not accord with that of the plurality in Dasreef, or that which her Honour had said that she would adopt.
	
	
	Despite this, the first ground of appeal must be rejected. The trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s evidence. If the assumptions on which his opinions were based were not established by the evidence led at trial, they could not, however be relied on in determining whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Ground 4 – the reasons given were inadequate


	
	It is convenient to next deal with ground 4.
	
	
	The obligation to give reasons in a judge alone trial is governed by s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The trial judge was also obliged to explain the reasons for the findings of fact which she made: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250; [1998] HCA 68 at [30] and to expose her reasoning process: Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [6].
	


The conviction judgment


	
	The conviction judgment was delivered orally on 21 and 22 November 2016, after judgment was reserved on 26 October. Mr Nisan’s case that the majority of the judgment dealt with an outline of the evidence and the parties’ submissions must be accepted.
	
	
	There was no issue taken with the various binding principles to which the trial judge referred. She also noted that the test of whether Mr Nisan had been driving dangerously was an objective one, which did not require the Crown to establish that he knew or realised that he was driving the truck in a dangerous manner. Her Honour also observed that the Crown's case was circumstantial and that Mr Nisan had advanced two hypotheses consistent with his innocence:
	


“1   Dr White is (reasonably) possibly correct. If Dr White is possibly correct then it is possible the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy and if the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy then the truck itself is unroadworthy.

2   If Dr White is wrong and Mr Ruller is correct, based on Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements Mr Ruller says the front brakes were poorly adjusted, then Dr Hart says even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade and brake fade was the cause of the accident”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 9.


	
	The trial judge referred extensively to a chronology of relevant events, including dates when the brakes had been adjusted prior to the collision, the last time on 11 September 2014. Her Honour then turned to explain where the collision occurred on 21 October 2014, before turning to the Crown which was explained to be:
	


“The Crown submitted the Crown case is that the accused failed to control a fully laden truck down a steep decline, such that it struck a number of cars at the intersection of Pittwater Road and Warringah Road, seriously injuring two persons in a Mazda 2 and injuring four others. The Crown case is that in order to drive safely down a steep decline the accused needed to reduce his speed sufficiently so that he could adhere to the signposted 20 kilometre per hour sign which, for this truck, meant that he could not have been in more than third gear. He should have engaged the exhaust brake but he did not. The Crown case is that the accused was travelling at an excessive speed in the circumstances and was consequently in too high a gear to drive safely down the decline.

His actions thereafter only made it more likely that the outcome would be disastrous, in that he tried to gear down, which at least disengages the engine and therefore the ability to brake, or worse, can end up in the engine going into the wrong, that is a higher, gear, making it more difficult to brake, or at worst, that the truck goes into neutral gear and therefore has far less ability to brake. Secondly, that he did not use the exhaust brake which, if engaged, has a retarding effect on the engine. Third, that he attempted to use the hand brake which, in normal circumstances, cannot be engaged whilst the service brake is engaged.

He was at this point, the Crown said, panicking, as he acknowledged in the later part of his interview, because, the Crown says, he knew the peril he was in”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 18 – 19.


	
	The circumstances relied on by the Crown were identified to be:
	


“1.   That the truck was travelling at an excessive speed, about 65 kilometres per hour, immediately prior to impact;

2.   That the gearstick was in neutral post-impact;

3.   That the exhaust brake was not engaged;

4.   That the brakes were serviceable, albeit not at maximum braking efficiency;

5.   That the accused admitted he was the driver (no dispute);

6.   The accused denied speeding and asserted brake failure. The Crown submits this is unreliable; and

7.   He was going about 40 kilometres per hour at the third pair of 20 kilometre per hour signs”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 22 – 23.


	
	Her Honour then observed that the Crown had the onus of “excluding to my satisfaction that guilt is the only rational hypotheses or reasonable inference”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 23.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to the expert evidence, noting that its value depended on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the experts had used, in order to arrive at their opinions. Her Honour noted that there were conflicts between the opinions of Mr Ruller, Constable Wilson, Dr Hart and Dr White. She then outlined their respective opinions and what they were based on, in considerable detail, noting that only Constable Wilson had physically examined the truck, in a condition which was said to be the same as at the time of the collision.
	
	
	As to Mr Ruller, her Honour noted that in summary, his opinions were:
	


“1.    The signage along Warringah Road was sufficient and provided ample warning to drivers of heavy vehicles that there was a steep descent ahead.

2.    The brakes fitted to the truck were in proper working order with the exception of the front brakes. In particular the front left steer brake was out of adjustment. The front right steer brake was almost out of adjustment.

3.    All four wheel groups on the drive and lazy axles had sufficient brake adjustment. If the brakes were operating at a temperature under 300 degrees Fahrenheit they would have had sufficient brake adjustment to allow for wheel lockup.

4.    If the four wheel groups on the drive axles had an operational brake temperature about 400 degrees Fahrenheit there would be a reduction in the brake efficiency. However, the brake adjustment would still have been sufficient to bring the truck to a stop from 65 kilometres per hour whilst on the descent towards Pittwater Road.

5.    Based on the statements provided by Mr Nisan during interview, his knowledge of the exhaust brake would appear to be limited. It would be my opinion that the exhaust brake was not in operation at the time of the crash. This would reduce considerably the deceleration of the vehicle as it travelled down the hill.

6.    The minimum gear that the truck would have been in at the top of the hill if the estimated speed of 40 kilometres per hour provided by Mr Nisan is accepted would have been fifth gear.

7.    This incident is a direct result of Mr Nisan failing to reduce the speed of the truck and choosing the correct gearing prior to attempting to descend the hill”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 30 – 31.


	
	Later her Honour referred to the cross-examination where Mr Ruller agreed that in his second report he had said that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and in need of adjustment and that the truck was not fit to be on the road and that the truck driver may not have been aware of this, until he started feeling that he had to use more air pressure.
	
	
	As to brake temperature, her Honour noted that without allowing for heat in the brakes, Mr Ruller assessed their overall efficiency to be about 85% and with heat above 400°F, about 77%, but that still allowed considerable braking of the truck: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 29.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted Mr Ruller’s agreement with Dr White, that the truck's foundation brake assembly was roadworthy and in generally good condition, but that he had disagreed with his other conclusions, in whole or in part. She also noted Mr Ruller’s observations about conclusions reached by Dr Hart and evidence which Mr Ruller gave in cross-examination, including that brake fade could have been a contributing factor to the accident, in its later stages: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 39.
	
	
	After outlining the evidence of the other experts and what Mr Nisan had told police after the collision, her Honour noted that the Crown's case was that the truck was not suffering a mechanical defect, relevant to causation. She then turned to summarise, again in considerable detail, both the Crown and defence case, by reference to the evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour dealt with ‘The Crown key points”, namely, “The Brakes and the Experts” – where she noted that it was “[a]greed that poorly adjusted brakes fade at a lower temperature. Agreed between Hart and Ruller that brake fade played a part.” She then turned to “The Interview” and “Brake Fade”, observing that “The experts agree that brake fade played a part”.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to “The defence key points”, beginning with “Introduction”, then “Mr Nisan’s version”, “The consequences of having the front brakes out of alignment” and “The brake force calculations of Mr Ruller”, noting the Crown case that the brakes were poorly adjusted. She then turned to “Other particulars of the offences alleged by the Crown”, beginning with “Incorrect gear selection”, then “the exhaust brake”, “use of handbrake , “good character” and “speed of truck at bottom of Hill”
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to “Conclusion”. There had not earlier been a ‘conclusion’ section, when her Honour summarised the Crown’s “key points”. Whether what her Honour said at this point of her judgment, was intended to be an explanation of the defence’s final ‘key points’, or her Honour’s conclusion, is not entirely clear. Her Honour said:
	


“The Court must find that (a) it is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were; or (b) the condition of the brakes was as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted. Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident.

I will just go back. The Court must find that:

(a)    It is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were, or,

(b)    The condition of the brakes were as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted.

Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a) If Dr White is correct, the truck’s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b) If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.

Having considered all of the evidence, and the lengthy submissions of counsel, I will now consider the individual circumstances brought forward by the Crown and the two hypotheses contended for by the defence. What I say under each heading is somewhat of a summary but it is essentially the reasons for the view that I come to in respect of each.

I will also consider whether there is any other alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence.”


	
	What her Honour here initially twice observed, when she began “[t]he Court must find that”, reflected the defence submissions. There was an issue as to whether Dr White or Mr Ruller’s opinion about the state of the brakes would be accepted, which had to be resolved. It was the defence case that whichever opinion was accepted, the Crown could not exclude the possibility that poor adjustment had caused the accident.
	
	
	Her Honour appeared to accept this, when she went on to say that:
	


“Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a)    If Dr White is correct, the truck’s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b)    If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.”


	
	If that is correct, the conclusion to which her Honour finally came, that the Crown had proven its case, was inconsistent with this finding.
	
	
	To understand how her Honour came to conclude that the Crown had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, it is best to record what her Honour then held in relation to the circumstances the Crown had advanced and the hypotheses the defence had raised. To that point the judgment did not clearly identify the matters over which the parties had joined issue. In the conclusions reached, there was no reference to matters which had been resolved in the cross-examination of Mr Ruller, as was apparent from her Honour’s earlier summary of his and Dr Hart’s evidence.
	
	
	The reasoning for some of the conclusions which her Honour reached by the summary method which she adopted, is difficult to follow. Some of the conclusions are affected by her Honour’s erroneous approach to the expert evidence and some of her Honour’s findings are contradictory. In the result, Mr Nisan’s case that the reasons given are inadequate must be accepted.
	
	
	The trial judge’s conclusions were:
	


CIRCUMSTANCE ONE

That the truck was travelling at an excessive speed, about 65 kilometres per hour, immediately prior to impact. I accept Senior Constable Fenton’s evidence about this. Other lay evidence does not affect my view of his accuracy.

The unchallenged evidence of Senior Constable Fenton is that the average speed of the truck over a distance of 24 to 32 metres, ending at the median strip at Pittwater Road, was 65 kilometres an hour. Mr Ruller supported the methodology of Senior Constable Fenton.

CIRCUMSTANCE TWO

That the gearstick was in neutral post impact. I accept Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence about this.

Under circumstance three, the evidence of Mr Grgic, the tow truck driver who towed the truck from the collision site to the RMS, is summarised. I accept his evidence beyond reasonable doubt. This supports Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence.

CIRCUMSTANCE THREE

That the exhaust brake was not engaged. I accept Senior Constable Wilson’s evidence about this. He said when he examined the truck it was “off”.

I accept Mr Ruller when he said, “It would be my opinion that the exhaust brake was not in operation at the time of the crash”.

I accept Dean Grgic’s evidence that he did not touch anything to do with the gearbox, brakes or suspension.

I also accept his evidence the other fellow with him did not touch anything. He said, “I can guarantee a hundred percent.” He said about himself, “I can tell you a hundred percent I did not touch the gearbox, the suspension or the brakes”. He was an impressive witness.

Mr Cowie said he did not hear the noise he would have expected to hear if the exhaust brake was on.

CIRCUMSTANCE FOUR

That the brakes were serviceable, albeit not at maximum braking efficiency. The history of the servicing of the brakes is noted in the chronology and does not need to be repeated.

I am satisfied the brakes had been serviced in an appropriate and timely way.

It was Senior Constable Wilson who examined the truck in the most ideal circumstances. He was the only expert who physically examined the truck in a condition when it can be said it was the same as at the time of the collision.

He conducted an electronic brake roller test with an approved device and all the brakes received a pass.

Dr White, Senior Constable Wilson and Mr Ruller agreed the truck’s foundation brake assemblies were roadworthy and generally in good condition.

Senior Constable Wilson relied on his having tested the truck shortly after the accident with the truck running and he utilised the foot pedal. He relied on the Roads and Maritime Services brake roller test result and his photos.

Mr Ruller had no concern about Senior Constable Wilson’s methodology, nor did Dr Hart.

All these matters favour his results as being accurate.

I have no concern about Senior Constable Wilson’s credit. I found him to be a careful expert witness. His handwritten report was tendered (Exhibit PP).

Mr Ruller said the truck should be tested loaded, although the Roads and Maritime Services do not require this. He had a different view to Senior Constable Wilson about this.

In any event, he concluded even given the adjustment problem with the steer axle - and he was of the view clearly there was a problem with the steer axle adjustment, and I have already analysed his evidence and summarised it - the brakes were sufficient, or the braking ability was sufficient to control the truck.

Dr White examined the truck in an uncontrolled, unsecured situation. There had been a month of weathering.

I accept, having considered all of the evidence, this circumstance. In support of this finding, I also note what is found under “Hypothesis One”.

CIRCUMSTANCE FIVE

That the accused admitted he was the driver (no dispute). I am satisfied of this.

CIRCUMSTANCE SIX

The accused denied speeding asserted brake failure (unreliable). These assertions are dealt with elsewhere under “Circumstance Seven” and “Circumstance Four”.

CIRCUMSTANCE SEVEN

He was going about 40 kilometres per hour at the third pair of 20 kilometre per hour signs. The accused must be in error when he said he went down to low gear one in the interview. In low gear one, the maximum speed is 12 kilometres per hour (Exhibit XX).

Dr Hart agreed with Mr Ruller that Mr Nisan could not have been in gear one low ratio.

He should have been in third gear prior to reach the top of the hill.

Mr Ruller independently came to the view the Crown contends for, being the accused meant the top of the hill as May Road, not back up west of Alfred.

After some concern, I am satisfied the accused meant the top of the hill to be the top of the hill. The downhill part is where the third 20 sign is as the Crown contends. The accused signals with his hands in the interview at about this point.

I accept this circumstance.

HYPOTHESIS ONE

Dr White is (reasonably) possibly correct. If Dr White is possibly correct then it is possible the truck’s foot brakes were unroadworthy and if the truck’s footbrakes were unroadworthy then the truck itself is unroadworthy.

Dr White examined the truck in an uncontrolled, unsecured situation.

Mr Ruller noted, and I agree, if the brakes were as bad as Dr White said, they would have failed well before that hill. Some 50-odd kilometres was driven. Well before then, they would have failed.

The viewing of the photographs is inconsistent with the evidence of Dr White as already noted. Wilson, White and Hart say in adjustment (Exhibits UU, TT, A) from looking at the angles, and that is in relation to the right (driver or offside) axle 2; and Wilson and Hart say in adjustment (Exhibits A, TT) from looking at the angles, and that is in relation to the right (driver or offside) axle 3.

Dr White agreed the brakes could have been backed off in between his test and the earlier testing of Senior Constable Wilson.

Dr White accepted the condition Senior Constable Wilson examined the truck in was to be preferred.

He could not explain the big difference in the figures between those he obtained and those Senior Constable Wilson obtained, nor could Dr Hart. Dr Hart said he was unable to reconcile them. Dr Hart could not say which expert was correct.

I accept there is no actual evidence of the brakes being backed off. Having said that, such is a possibility. There is clearly a gap which is apparent from the summary of the evidence concerning the movement of the vehicle.

Senior Constable Wilson carried out two tests. He filled out the form, Exhibit PP. He has a professional disinterest in the measurements and Dr White agreed with him about the front brakes.

If Dr White is right, why did the truck not fail the Maha test?

In relation to this hypothesis, I also rely on my findings under Circumstance Four.

I accept the Crown submission Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements are supported by the totality of the evidence on the measurements on the back brakes.

I reject beyond reasonable doubt the evidence of Dr White about the back brakes. In my view, his evidence is not possibly correct.

HYPOTHESIS TWO

If Dr White is wrong and Mr Ruller is correct, based on Senior Constable Wilson’s measurements Mr Ruller says the front brakes were poorly adjusted and Dr Hart says even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade and brake fade was the cause of the accident.

If Mr Nisan was driving at too high a speed too late, which I accept, then this would have inhibited his ability to gear down and consequentially slow his speed.

Mr Ruller accepts brake fade “near the end” but by then the damage had been done. The dangerous driving had resulted in a disastrous outcome.

I repeat again the Crown submission already noted at transcript p 1029:

‘His actions thereafter only made it more likely that the outcome would be disastrous, in that he tried to gear down, which at least disengages the engine and therefore the ability to brake, or worse, can end up in the engine going into the wrong, that is, a higher gear, making it more difficult to brake, or at worst, that the truck goes into neutral and therefore has far less ability to brake; secondly, that he did not use the exhaust brake which, if engaged, has a retarding effect on the engine; third, that he attempted to use the handbrake which, in normal circumstances, cannot be engaged while the service brake is engaged.’

I accept Mr Ruller’s evidence that the brakes, albeit not perfect, were not determinative of the events.

I have real difficulty with Dr Hart’s opinion applying common sense. As Mr Ruller, said Mr Nisan was the driver of the same truck over the same route the day before but there was no crash.

Mr Ruller said, as already stated:

‘[32]   On p 77 at line 1559 of the Hart Report [he also] states the following:

‘The truck route was 55 kilometres. I estimated that there are 88 potential stopping or slowing points on the route not dependent upon traffic density. There are several steep hills at the Warringah Road end of the journey. It is likely that the truck brakes were ‘hot’ when it reached the final descent on Warringah Road. Hot brakes have a drum temperature exceeding 250 degrees Centigrade. Extreme brake temperature is greater than 350 degrees Centigrade. It is plausible that the brakes were at extreme temperature on the final descent.’

[33]    If the driver has driven the truck in a manner as described above, he should never have been behind the wheel of the truck. Mr Nisan was the driver of the same truck the previous day yet there was no crash as would be expected had he driven in the manner suggested by Mr(sic) Hart. This comment would seem to suggest that any truck on the road at any time following the same route would suffer brake fade prior to travelling down this grade.’

Dr Hart’s evidence was effectively the brakes could have faded out at any time.

As a matter of common sense also, and based on the hypothesis put forward by Dr Hart, trucks should have their brakes fade down that hill virtually every day. His answer to this was, ‘It is a notorious hill.’

I reject beyond reasonable doubt brake fade was a cause of the accident.

In my view, the accident was not caused by any mechanical defect or brake fade. I reject both of these as being reasonably possible.

Given my acceptance of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown, I am satisfied that these together prove to my satisfaction the element in dispute in this trial, being at the time of the impact the accused was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person. This is the only reasonable inference or conclusion that can be drawn. There is no other alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 25 – 31.


	
	If the trial judge’s conclusion was that “the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident”, her rejection “beyond reasonable doubt that brake fade was a cause of the accident”, was inconsistent with that finding. In any event, the latter conclusion was wrong, given the expert evidence, to which I will come.
	
	
	Her Honour’s conclusion was sought to be supported by what is described to be “common sense”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32. A finding that it was possible that it was the brakes which had caused this collision, rather than Mr Nisan’s driving, could not conceivably lead to the conclusion that if there had been brake fade “trucks should have their brakes fail down that hill virtually every day”, as the trial judge postulated: see R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32.
	
	
	Further, not only was it the common view of Mr Ruller and Dr Hart that there were problems with the functioning of the brakes, which had led to them fading as Mr Nisan attempted to slow down on Warringah Hill, how they had been maintained was relevant to what had caused them to fade. The trial judge gave no reasons, however, for the conclusion that “the brakes had been serviced in an appropriate and timely way”: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 28. That conclusion was contrary to the evidence of Dr Hart and the manufacturer of the truck.
	
	
	Additionally, not only was there objective evidence that the brakes had overheated, but both Mr Ruller and Dr Hart agreed that the brakes had faded. Dr Hart’s opinion was that the ‘after market’ brake linings had contributed to the overheating, which resulted in the brakes fading. This was not referred to in the trial judge’s conclusions.
	
	
	The conclusion that the reasons given were inadequate is reinforced by the trial judge’s reference to the fact that the truck’s brakes had not failed the preceding day. In her view that precluded the conclusion that they had failed on the day of the collision, also as a matter of ‘common sense’. That is quite illogical, particularly when considered in light of what the experts had agreed, to which I will come.
	
	
	In the result, the conclusion that the reasons given were inadequate is inescapable. Accordingly, this ground of appeal should be upheld.
	


Grounds 2 and 4(a) – Mr Nisan’s record of interview


	
	There was an issue between the parties as to what Mr Nisan had meant when he answered questions about his speed; the point at which he had attempted to slow down; and what he had done when changing the gears. Mr Ruller and Dr Hart each considered his answers and had made different assumptions about what Mr Nisan had meant, in arriving at their opinions.
	
	
	This fell to her Honour to resolve, in deciding whether their opinions could be accepted.
	
	
	In final submissions the parties addressed what Mr Nisan had said at various points during the interview, submissions to which her Honour addressed various questions. Her Honour finally accepted the Crown's submissions as to what Mr Nisan had meant, in the result coming to the same conclusion that Mr Ruller had reached in his report, namely, that Mr Nisan had only attempted to reduce his speed, when he reached the second 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	It follows that admission of Mr Ruller’s opinions, based as they were in part by what he understood Mr Nisan to have meant, is unlike the circumstances which arose for consideration in R v Banhelyi [2012] QCA 357. There it was concluded that Mr Ruller did not have the expertise to form opinions as to what was depicted in video footage which recorded the activation of indicator and brake lights.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s answers on interview, it may be accepted, were not entirely clear. Fairly read, however, what he said about how he had attempted to reduce the speed of the truck, which was in low range, from 40kph to 20kph, by taking his foot off the accelerator and changing gears down, eventually to one, while using the footbrake, prior to the 20kph speed zone, could not reasonably be understood to have meant that he had only attempted to reduce the truck’s speed at the first 20kph speed limit sign, rather than the first warning sign of the reduced speed zone which he knew was ahead, having driven this route twice or more a week for some two years.
	
	
	It follows that while her Honour did not err in admitting Mr Ruller’s assumptions about what Mr Nisan had meant, in coming to the same conclusions as he did about what Mr Nisan meant and then accepting Mr Ruller’s opinions about where it was that Mr Nisan began slowing the truck, her Honour erred. Mr Ruller’s assumptions were not made good by a fair reading of what Mr Nisan told police who interviewed him and accordingly his opinion could not be accepted.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s answers had to be understood in the context that the speed limit on the long descent to the intersection at the foot of Warringah Hill was initially 70kph and later 60kph. On the steep part of the descent the limit for trucks was 20kph. Before this 20kph zone was reached, there were two sets (a set being one sign on each side of the road) of white and black signs warning of the approaching 20kph speed limit. There were then two sets of red and white 20kph speed limit signs, the first at the top of the steep descent and another further on. Shortly before the intersection was another sign, which indicated the end of the 20kph zone.
	
	
	What Mr Nisan said when initially asked on interview to start “from the beginning” was:
	


“A (Int):   We are the drivers. We know this downhill ah, the speed is twenty, twenty. Oh, there are two signs, one of them black and white. Ah, due to the fact that I've been ah, driving on that direction to Dee Why for the last two years I know that street or road very, very well, I know that sign, the first one, the black and white. Before reaching the sign I start, I start reducing the speed. When I reached the second sign the speed would be twenty and I will never drive more than twenty, maybe less than twenty. Before reaching the first sign I was starting to reduce the speed. It was, yeah, it was under the forty before reaching the twenty, twenty speed area. I attempted to reduce the speed to twenty. At the top of the hill I was braking, braking to reduce the speed, but didn't go down. I realised the problem was with the brake, braking. I tried to pull the handbrake to stop the speed downhill. It didn't work. It was unsuccessful. The truck was loaded. The speed, the truck's speed increased, started to increase down the hill. I tried until the last minute pressing on the brake. Can I continue?

Q21   Ah hmm.

A (Int):   I realised that’s it, no chance by braking. I saw the cars in front of me. I tried to prevent my truck to go immediately into the cars in front of me. I tried to turn the truck to the left. I tried but what happened happened. The truck flipped on its side.”


	
	Her Honour did not refer to Mr Nisan’s answer to question 20, or the detail of what he said elsewhere in this interview in her conclusions. There she said that:
	


“I am satisfied the accused meant the top of the hill to be the top of the hill. The downhill part is where the third 20 sign is as the Crown contends. The accused signals with his hands in the interview at about this point.”


	
	What Mr Nisan meant by his answer was, however, extensively explored in the interview.
	
	
	Answers to questions 52 to 54 disclosed that Mr Nisan had been working for his employer for two years, driving this route twice or more a week. He agreed that he knew the road well. In questions 56 to 61 he was asked about the number of signs on the road. He answered:
	


“Q56   O.K. Now, I think you told me when you were coming down the road there were two signs, one black and white. What does that sign say?

A (Int):   It's a black and white sign. It's warning, warning the drivers that the speed will become twenty.

Q57   And where is that sign situated, on your left or on your right?

A (Int):   On the right.

Q58   Now, you said there was two. That's one sign, black and white. What's

the other sign you're referring to?

A (Int):   Ah, after the black and white there is the red and white sign.

Q59   And where is that situated?

A (Int):   Both sides. Oh, yeah, I am, sure on the right, but maybe both of them on both sides, but I am sure the sign on the right.

Q60   [19.09] O.K. So are you saying there's two signs or maybe three signs now?

A (Int):   Two black and white and two red and white.

Q61   And if I was to suggest to you that there were actually more than four signs what could you say about that?

A (Int):   Four signs, two black and white and two red and white.”


	
	Mr Nisan was also asked:
	


“Q62   Now, you said you started reducing speed. What were, speed were you going prior to reducing your speed?

A (int):   Forty. Yeah, it was forty before reaching the area, before reaching the sign.

Q63   Then I think you said when you reached the second sign you were doing twenty or maybe less than twenty.

A (int):   But not today. Today, I didn't go down to twenty today.

Q64   What was the speed that you reduced to prior to putting your brakes on?

A (Int):   Before reaching the black and white sign down to forty. I attempted to go down to twenty. It failed. It didn't. The speed increased, started to increase when I was braking.

Q65   The twenty sign, is that before you start to go down the hill?

A (Int):   Yes, yeah. The sign before downhill.

Q66   So - - -

A (Int):   First the sign then the downhill start.

Q67   So when you tried to reduce your speed from forty to twenty were you still driving on the flat or had you started going down the road, down the hill. MR ALALI Sorry, can you repeat that?

SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q68   When you were driving along doing forty you said you tried to reduce to twenty. Is that while you were still on flat or had you started to go downhill?

A (Int):   I was here before the downhill, just at the top, at the top, then the speed increased, started to increase slowly.”


	
	By this exchange Mr Nisan was saying that he had slowed to 40kph by the time he reached the black and white sign, but he was unable to slow to 20kph, by the time he reached the red 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	When asked what else he did to try and reduce his speed, Mr Nisan said:
	


“Q70   [19.13] And what else did you do to try and reduce the speed?

A (Int):   I'd pulled the handbrake and tried to check the gear. The gear was O.K. The truck continued. I can't remember what happened. I panicked.

Q71   Now, you said you attempted to reduce the speed and you realised there was a problem with the brake. How did you know there was a problem with the brake?

A (Int):   I was braking and nothing happened. It was obvious braking failure.

Q72   Now, when you were saying you were braking what was the feeling or sensation you got?

A (Int):   All my attempts pressing on the pedal of the brake, it's nothing happened, nothing happen or the, the, the speed is not slowing.

Q73   When you say there was nothing happening what was the brake pedal doing?

A (Int):   Despite the fact I am pressing on the brake as normal, but the speed, there is no change in the speed. The speed increasing despite the fact I am continuously pressing on the brake.

Q74   Did the brake pedal go to the floor?

A   Yeah.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q75   So every, are you saying that every time you pressed the brake it went to the floor?

A (Int):   Today?

Q76   Yes.

A (Int):   To the end. I ah, all my attempt is to stop that ah, the truck. To the end. To the, I tried more than once.

Q77   Then I think you said you tried the parking brake. What happened then?

A (Int):   At that time the speed started to increase. When I pulled the handbrake nothing happened. The speed wasn't affected. The truck continued.

Q78   Did you say then that the speed increased when you pulled the handbrake on?

A (Int):   It was all in a matter of seconds, seconds. I pulled the handbrake, the speed continued increasing.”


	
	As to the gear he was in, Mr Nisan said:
	


“Q79   And what gear were you in at the time?

A (Int):   One, low gear. Um, um, when I started I started on low gear, one.

Q80   [19.17] So when you started, before you went down the hill you were in first gear are you saying?

A (Int):   Before reaching the sign I started to go down with the gear, four, three, two, but I am sure at the top of the hill I went down to low gear, one. I tried to find a solution. I panicked. I tried to go number one. Nothing happened.”


	
	From this exchange Mr Nisan was saying that he had gone through the gears in low range from 4 down to 1, but he was not able to get into first gear.
	
	
	Signage was returned to after Mr Nisan said that he had noticed something was wrong with the air gauges. He then said:
	


“Q89   And where was this? Where were you on the roadway when that happened?

A (Int):   After the forty when I started, when I wanted to reduce the speed, before the sign when I started, I wanted to reduce the speed.

Q90   [19.21] And is that the sign up on the flat before you go down the hill?

A (Int):   Yes, flat, that's right.

Q91   Well, if you're still driving on the flat and you're only doing forty kilometres per hour why couldn't you stop the vehicle?

A (Int):   Oh, well, it was on forty. I attempted to go down to twenty then I realised something wrong with the gauge. I knew something was wrong with the brakes.

Q92   O.K. The twenty kilometre per hour speed limit which one are you referring to? Where is that situated?

A (Int):   What do you mean? Can you explain?

Q93   Well, you were saying that there are a number of signs going along Warringah Road and I think they warn a driver to slow to twenty.

A (Int):   Yes.

Q94   And where is that first sign that says twenty?

A (Int):   You mean the location? I can't understand.

Q95   Well, are you still driving along the flat when you have to move to twenty or are you going down the hill?

A (Int):   Can I, can l explain?

Q96   No. Sorry. I’m just, I’m just going to show you some pictures. Might be easier to explain.”


	
	In evidence at trial was a video recording of the drive down the road, past the signs, but that was not shown to Mr Nisan. Instead, he was then shown some photographs, with the signs numbered 1 to 4. After he said he recognised number 3, the first 20kph sign, he was asked:
	


“Q110   [19.27] O.K. Earlier you mentioned about changing gears or slowing down prior to the twenty K sign.

A (Int):   Yes, and here approximately the speed was around forty.

Q111   Around about forty. O.K.

A (Int):   I attempted, I, yes. I've tried to slow down to twenty but the truck didn't slow down.

Q112   O.K. So if I'm going to write here urn, forty Ks an hour at this point —

A (Int):   I cannot confirm —

Q113   O.K.

A   Exactly.

A (Int):   - - - at what point exactly.

Q114   O.K. When, do, do you know what this sign means?

A (Int):   Further down it'll be twenty. I can drive more than twenty after this sign, but when I, after the red no, definitely not. It should be twenty.

Q115   O.K. Do you know the speed limit on this road?

A (Int):   I'm not sure hundred percent. Seventy. It's ah, seventy, sixty but I'm not sure.”


	
	From this exchange, it is apparent that Mr Nisan was explaining that while he had attempted to reduce his speed before he reached the 20kph speed limit sign, he had been unable to do so and when he reached that sign, he was still travelling at 40kph.
	
	
	Mr Nisan was later asked again about the signs, by reference to a diagram and the photos at question 139. He then said that he was tired, exhausted, unable to remember exactly and was having trouble concentrating. He was given water and the interview continued. Later he was asked:
	


“SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q150   [19.39] I think earlier we were talking about the twenty kilometre truck and speed limit sign. Is this the one you're referring to in photograph 5?

A (Int):   Yeah, this is the last sign, yes. Must be twenty after this.

Q151   And do you agree that where this sign is the roadway is still flat?

A (Int):   The, the, the downhill start, the road start going down from the top from the first sign, slowly, slowly. This is not flat. Slowly, 'cause when you're driving the truck you can feel you start, start going down.

Q152   It's slightly is it?

A (Int):   Maybe you can see the ocean from the first traffic light. You can feel when you are driving the truck that it's not flat, slightly started going down.

A   Yeah, it's not, like, ah —

Q153   When, when you were driving down here where was your, your right foot?

A (Int):   Today?

Q154   Yes.

A (Int):   On the brake, I was trying on the brake.

Q155   Was it, was it still on the accelerator?

A (Int):   On the brake. No, no, on the brake.

Q156   O.K. And at that stage can you tell me, you might have already said, what gear you were in there?

A (Int):   l don't remember, when I started slowing down to forty, that's forty I was trying to reduce more and reaching this area here, down here the, the, the speed increased.

Q157    And had you tried to brake at that stage?

A (Int):    What stage?

Q158    When you went past this sign.

A (int):   Already I'd started, ah - - -

Q159   O.K.

A (Int)    - - - slowing down. The speed ah, went down to forty, but when I reached the downhill the speed started to increase up and up.”


	
	By this exchange, Mr Nisan was indicating that it was after he reached the 20kph speed limit sign, that his speed began to increase.
	
	
	Later, after he was taken to the signs again, Mr Nisan was asked what he understood the maximum speed in gear one low range was. He said that he thought it was up to 20kph, depending on the load and where the truck was travelling. Later he said that normally he drove down that incline in gear 3 and if the load was heavy, gear 2. Later Mr Nisan said that:
	


“Q170    [19.43] Could it have been that you were actually in fifth gear and not first gear?

A (Int):   … sure my finger is, you can feel it if it's on five, the truck will be lighter. I was certain, I was certain I went to down oh, to one. A, a, a truck driver can hear it from the sound, you know.

Q171   Yes. I realise that, but in the spur of the moment and you said it happened that quick, could you have actually been in fifth and not back to first?

A (Int)   I left the fifth before reaching that area because I started to slow down, went down with the gear.”


	
	Mr Nisan repeatedly said that it was very hard for him to remember exactly what had happened at different stages, because it had all happened in seconds. In his answer to question 190, he said that he could not remember if the exhaust brake had worked when he took his foot off the accelerator.
	
	
	In answering questions 193 and 194, he also said that he always had his foot on the brake on that hill, to make sure his speed did not go over 20kph and because someone could drive in front of him on that road. Mr Nisan was then asked:
	


“SERGEANT SAMUEL

Q196   If you're driving down in first gear wouldn't that also hold you back?

A (Int):   It does.

Q197   Because the truck can't do fifty or sixty kilometres in first gear obviously.

A (Int):   I tried, I attempted actually, I tried ah, to go on gear one, I, to make sure it's on one, but the speed didn't slow down. Increased.

Q198   So is it a case you might not have been in first gear?

A (Int):   …possibility it was on two, but when the downhill started, as I said, the, the, tried to slow down, I panicked when the truck didn’t slow down. I wanted to make sure if it was on low gear one.

Q199   So when you, you said you panicked, you could have been in second, could you have put the truck into neutral at that stage?

A (Int):   With the road going downhill … the speed would increase, go high ….”


	
	By this exchange Mr Nisan again agreed that he may not have succeeded in getting the truck into first gear.
	
	
	The Crown case on appeal was again that Mr Nisan was “very clear, both verbally and by his gestures”, that there were only two sets of signs on Warringah Hill. Further, that “by aiming to reduce his speed to 20kph by what was in reality the second set of mandatory speed limit signs, he … left it too late to reduce speed safely”.
	
	
	Neither of those conclusions were fairly open on what Mr Nisan said in the interview. Nor was the conclusion which the trial judge reached.
	
	
	In the result, while ground 2 must be dismissed, ground 4(a) must be upheld.
	


Ground 3 – unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable verdict


	
	Mr Ruller’s opinion was that the collision had occurred because of Mr Nisan’s driving, not mechanical problems, because he had not attempted to slow the truck to 20kph early enough on the descent. Dr Hart concluded that the collision had occurred because the brakes were out of adjustment and had become so hot that they lost effectiveness – preventing Mr Nisan from slowing the truck, as he had planned, to 20kph, in order to descend the hill.
	
	
	Mr Nisan’s case on appeal was that the evidence, including various concessions made by Mr Ruller in cross-examination and the resulting findings which the trial judge made in the conviction judgment, her Honour ought to have entertained a doubt about his guilt of the charges of which he was convicted: Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; [2007] HCA 30 at [113]. The reasons given for rejecting Dr Hart's opinions did not follow as a matter of common sense, were illogical, unsafe, unreasonable and plainly absurd.
	
	
	Mr Nisan also contended that in circumstances where Dr Hart, a leading expert in heavy vehicle braking with the greater expertise, considerable caution had to be exercised in preferring Mr Ruller's reported opinions. Further, given Mr Ruller’s evidence in cross-examination, that if he knew that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and in need of adjustment, he would not have taken the truck “out of the yard”, Dr Hart’s opinions should have been accepted.
	
	
	In the circumstances, in relation to what remained in dispute, Dr Hart's evidence should have been preferred, or at least led her Honour to the conclusion that there had to be a reasonable doubt as to Mr Nisan’s guilt of dangerous driving. Her Honour did not, as trial judge, enjoy an advantage from seeing and hearing the evidence, given at trial, which would preclude his appeal from being upheld: Filippou v The Queen at [12].
	
	
	On the Crown’s case Mr Nisan should not have used the brake at all on Warringah Hill, except perhaps in an emergency. The speed limit was 20kph and he should have driven in low gear, with the assistance of the exhaust brake.
	
	
	Accordingly, her Honour did not err in concluding that it was Mr Nisan’s manner of driving which had resulted in him exceeding the 20kph speed limit and causing the collision. As he descended the hill he was not only speeding, but driving in the incorrect gear; he had failed to use the exhaust brake; and he then attempted to use the handbrake, thereby depleting the air pressure of the footbrake system.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the fact that the truck was found to be in neutral at the scene of the collision, was likely to have been because Mr Nisan’s speed had been too high to permit the engine to allow him to reduce gears. This had also prevented engine retardation from limiting the speed of the truck.
	
	
	In my view the Crown’s case should not have succeeded at trial and Mr Nissan’s case must succeed on appeal.
	
	
	In evidence was:
	



	
	Constable Wilson’s initial report into the results of the tests which he conducted on the unloaded truck, after he had undertaken repairs to its air and fuel system which allowed normal air brake pressure to be achieved, with the rear axles chained;
	
	
	Mr Ruller’s initial report, in which he considered the results of Constable Wilson’s tests;
	
	
	Dr White’s initial report, he also having examined the truck and disagreeing with certain of Constable Wilson’s measurements;
	
	
	Mr Ruller’s second report, in which he commented on Dr White’s report;
	
	
	Constable Wilson’s second report, in which he responded to Dr White’s comments;
	
	
	Dr Hart’s report, in which he commented on the reports of Constable Wilson, Mr Ruller and Dr White; and
	
	
	Mr Ruller’s third report, in which he responded to Dr Hart’s report.
	



	
	Neither Dr Hart nor Mr Ruller had inspected the truck.
	
	
	Other evidence established that non-genuine or ‘after market’ brake linings had been installed on the truck’s brakes. Their operation was not tested by either Constable Wilson or Dr White, to determine whether they met applicable vehicle standard regulations, or whether their operation could have contributed to the brakes failing. Dr Hart considered that they had contributed to the brakes overheating and fading.
	
	
	While the experts were all called separately to be cross-examined and did not give their evidence concurrently, as would have been of obvious assistance to the trial judge, some agreements emerged.
	
	
	For example, in cross-examination Mr Ruller confirmed that he agreed that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and needed repair and that if he knew they were in that condition, he would not have driven the truck down Warringah Hill, or even taken it out of the yard. He also accepted that Mr Nisan may not have been aware of that problem, but in his view, he should have still been able to drive safely down the Hill, using normal driving procedures.
	
	
	On Dr Hart’s evidence, Mr Nisan needed to be in gear 5 or 6, to be driving the truck at 40kph. In his oral evidence Mr Ruller said that the truck would have needed to be in 5th gear.
	
	
	Mr Ruller agreed that the maximum speed for gear 5 was 40kph and that to go from 5th to 4th gear, Mr Nisan had to slow to the maximum speed of 29kph. When asked if the brakes should have been able to reduce the truck to that speed, Mr Ruller said that at the top of the hill, they should have “pulled him up”; that he could also slow his speed by taking his foot off the accelerator; that using the footbrake brake was an obvious way of reducing speed; and that:
	


“That's what I'm saying. If he had - looking at the 400 degrees at the top of the hill, had he hammered the brakes and tried to come to a stop at that point in time then I would say he probably could have pulled that vehicle up. It's going to take him an awful long time to do it.”


	
	In Dr Hart’s view, to achieve a speed of 20kph going down Warringah Hill, Mr Nisan had to shift down to gear 3. That is only possible if road speed and engine speed are suitable. In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed that to shift down, the truck had to be put into low range. After the collision it was found to be in that range, but in neutral.
	
	
	Dr Hart said that if the speed was too high, an attempted gear change would fail, resulting in either a higher gear, or neutral being selected. Neutral would preclude engine retardation slowing the truck’s speed. The driver would then have to rely completely on the footbrake, because the exhaust brake only worked in gear. The handbrake would also not then be of assistance, because it used the same brake mechanism as the footbrake. Mr Ruller agreed.
	
	
	Dr Hart’s opinion was that the truck’s exhaust brake would probably be powerful enough to control the descent of the truck, if it was in gear 1 or 2, but not in higher gears. This would, however, require a speed of only 10kph at the top of the final descent. Otherwise, a driver would also have to use the footbrake while descending this hill.
	
	
	Mr Ruller said that the footbrake could have been ‘feathered’. Further, when he drove that route, he had observed another truck driver using both the exhaust brake and the footbrake.
	
	
	Dr Hart considered that Mr Nisan was mistaken, when he said that he had shifted down to low gear one, given that the truck was in neutral. Further, because the exhaust brake was off, he must not have understood what it did, as was also Mr Ruller’s opinion.
	
	
	In Dr Hart’s opinion, if these brakes had been adequate, the collision would not have occurred. Mr Nisan had a driving plan which should have resulted in him descending the final part of the hill at 20kph. That speed was rendered impossible because of brake fade, caused by the brakes having become excessively hot and having lost effectiveness. Mr Ruller agreed that there had been brake fade. What he doubted, however, was that Mr Nisan had applied the brakes before he reached the first 20kph speed sign.
	
	
	While the temperature of the brakes could not be established, the experts agreed that they overheated. Mr Cowie’s evidence was that when he went to the truck after the collision, he noticed a burning smell. On the voir dire Mr Ruller had agreed that the brakes being 400°F would explain the smell.
	
	
	Dr Hart explained that drum brakes fade more quickly when in poor adjustment, because braking effect is not shared equally, that also increasing the chance of all brakes experiencing fade, as brake linings reach extreme temperatures. This leads to a cascading effect, which causes brakes to fade sooner. Given the 55kph route Mr Nisan had travelled before the collision and the ‘after market’ brake linings which had been installed, Dr Hart considered that it was plausible that the brakes had reached extreme drum brake temperature. Dr Hart also said in his report:
	


“There is a fundamental condition in both Mr Ruller’s and Snr Constable Wilson’s opinions. They claim that the truck brakes were in acceptable adjustment, in good working condition and of adequate capacity. The truck was not overloaded. They discount any significant effect from brake fade. In these conditions the service brakes on the truck should then have been able to stop the truck on the Warringah Rd hill. I do not believe that Mr Nisan wanted to crash the truck and I do not believe that he failed to apply the footbrake. The only plausible explanation is that the brakes on the truck faded as he drove it down Warringah Rd. If as claimed the brakes were in good adjustment, then they should have been adequate to stop the truck without the exhaust brake and engine retardation.”


	
	In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed with what Dr Hart said in this passage of his report, but still disagreed with Dr Hart about the point at which Mr Nisan applied the foot brake.
	
	
	Dr Hart disagreed with Mr Ruller's assumption that hot brakes had an effectiveness of 77% of cold brakes. On Dr Hart's evidence, if the brakes were as good as Mr Ruller said they were, they should have been capable of stopping the truck on the descent, notwithstanding that it was in neutral with the exhaust brake off.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Ruller agreed that the truck had a braking problem, or he said, Mr Nisan was trying to commit suicide.  He also agreed that poorly adjusted brakes were unsafe, because that would lengthen the stopping distance. Given that the truck was only doing 65kph at the time of the collision, he considered that the brakes had not failed completely and that brake fade had occurred only at the “later stages”. Dr Hart disagreed.
	
	
	From all of this evidence, I am satisfied that the Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s driving was dangerous, or that it caused the collision.
	
	
	The experts finally agreed that the truck’s footbrakes were defective. So defective that, in Mr Ruller’s view, the truck should not have been driven on the road at all. If the brakes had been properly adjusted, they should have been capable not only of slowing the truck down from 40kph, when Mr Nisan applied them after taking his foot off the accelerator, so that he could change gears in low range, on Mr Ruller’s evidence, they should have been able to bring the truck to a complete stop on the hill.
	
	
	The brakes did not achieve the deceleration necessary to permit Mr Nisan to effect the change into a lower gear, which he attempted. The result was that the truck was put into neutral and it accelerated, eventually to 65kph at the foot of the hill, where the collision occurred. In that situation, even if the exhaust brake had been on, it could not have operated to slow the truck’s speed while it was in neutral and travelling too quickly to permit a gear change. Mr Nisan said that he panicked when the brakes did not slow the truck and so he tried to use the handbrake, but that could be of no assistance to him, because of the way that the braking system operated.
	
	
	It follows that in using the foot brake as Mr Nisan said he did, to decelerate the truck while in it was in low range, so that he could change gears down, in order to descend Warringah Hill at the 20kph speed limit, he was not in breach of Road Rule 108. That Rule did not preclude Mr Nisan from using the foot brake to decelerate the truck, to permit such a gear change, before he reached the first speed sign. Rule 108 only required Mr Nisan to be driving at 20kph, when he reached the first 20kph speed limit sign and to drive at that speed until the 20kph zone ended.
	
	
	In that zone Mr Nisan had to drive in a gear low enough to limit the speed of the truck to that speed, without use of the foot brakes. The gear which would have limited the truck to that speed depended on the load which the truck was carrying that day. In order to put the truck into that gear, it had to be slowed. If the required slower speed could not be achieved by taking his foot off the accelerator, Mr Nissan had to use the truck’s foot brake, which should have been capable of bringing the truck to a stop.
	
	
	On his account, before he reached the speed sign Mr Nisan did take his foot off the accelerator, but that did not reduce the speed of the truck sufficiently so that he could change to a gear low enough, to allow it to descend the hill at 20kph. In that situation, considerations of safety undoubtedly required him to use the foot brake to reduce the speed of the truck, so that he could make such a gear change. That was what he attempted. His attempts failed, because the brakes faded.
	
	
	In that situation it cannot be considered that Mr Nisan’s use of the foot brake was dangerous. To the contrary, it was necessary. If properly adjusted, those brakes would have slowed the truck sufficiently to permit him to change gears down as he attempted. That they did not do so was because of the problems with the adjustment of the brakes which the experts identified.
	
	
	It follows that while the evidence established that the truck did not adhere to the 20kph speed limit, it did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that this was the result of Mr Nisan’s driving, rather than the state of the foot brakes. In the result, it could not be concluded that the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisan’s s driving was dangerous, as her Honour finally concluded.
	
	
	This ground of appeal must accordingly be upheld, as must the conviction appeal.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would make are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted;
	
	
	The conviction appeal be upheld;
	
	
	The convictions be quashed; and
	
	
	The appellant should be released forthwith.
	



	
	CAMPBELL J:   I have had the considerable advantage of considering Schmidt J’s reasons in draft. I agree with the orders proposed for the reasons her Honour gives. I wish to record that having considered the evidence for myself I am of the view that notwithstanding the advantages enjoyed by the learned trial judge, for the reasons given by Schmidt J it was not open to her to convict the appellant.

89,2758106,R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 1325,"Judgment 

1The Crown applies to cross-examine Mr Maiava pursuant to s 38 Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that evidence he gave was unfavourable to the Crown and on the basis of a prior inconsistent statement. The particular evidence concerns whether Mr Maiava sought clarification from Andrew about what Andrew meant when he said he wanted Mr Maiava to find someone to do a job for him in respect of a witness. When the Crown asked Mr Maiava if Mr Maiava sought to clarify what Andrew meant Mr Maiava said that he did not. 

2The Crown pointed to what is contained in paragraph 7 of Mr Maiava's Statement of 13 October 2011 where Mr Maiava said that he told the Police: 

When we were doing these laps, Andrew said to me, ""Do you 
know anyone that will do a job?"" 

I said, ""What kind of a job?"" 

He said, ""Just a job"" 

I said, ""Oh yeah I know what you mean"" 

He said, ""I'll pay them 10 grand to make sure a witness doesn't get to court"" 

I understood that to mean, that he wants me to organise to get rid of the witness, as in kill him. I said to him, ""So you want me to get rid of him as in kill him?"" Andrew laughed in an evil way, which I took as an agreeance with my understanding of his request to kill a witness in his court case. 

3Mr Maiava's Statement then went on to say this: 

8. Andrew said to me, ""The witness I want to get rid of was a mate of mine who I asked to give me an alibi."" 

4The Crown submitted that Mr Maiava's oral evidence was unfavourable to the Crown because it did not go as far as what the Statement contained and, therefore, left the question of what precisely Andrew meant when he spoke to Mr Maiava about doing a job. 

5Mr O'Sullivan submitted that the evidence given by Mr Maiava was not unfavourable to the Crown. He submitted also that it was not inconsistent with what was contained in the Statement. 

6At the time the Crown first made the application the relevant question and answer of the witness was this: 

Q. Did you ever ask him, when you say you understood him to mean knock, did you ever ask him about that, if that's what he meant? 
A. No, I didn't. 

7That evidence was not inconsistent with what appeared in Mr Maiava's Statement because the Statement did not suggest that Mr Maiava had asked Andrew what he meant. Because there was no clear inconsistency that suggested that at that point the evidence was not unfavourable to the Crown. For that reason I said that I would not permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava, but would permit the Crown to seek to obtain from him in a non-leading fashion the evidence that was contained in paragraph 7 of his Statement. I said that if the Crown was unsuccessful in obtaining that evidence I would reconsider the question of cross-examination. 

8In the presence of the jury the following evidence was then given: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Q. Mr Maiava, you told us that Andrew Iskandar asked you to ""get rid of a witness"", I think were your words? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Were they the words that used 
A. Yes. 

Q. ""Get rid of""? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell him what you thought that meant, ""get rid of""? 
A. I just asked him what he said to me, you wanted to do a job, and that's all I asked him. 

Q. And you've told us what you understand ""do a job"" means? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell Andrew what you believed that meant? 
A. No. 

9At that point the Crown Prosecutor renewed her application to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

10In R v Pantoja [1998] NSWSC 565 James J (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) said: 

Although the heading to s 38 of the Evidence Act is ""unfavourable witnesses"", the section itself refers to ""evidence"" given by a witness and in my view leave can be granted to cross-examine a witness on part only of his evidence if it is unfavourable to the party calling him or inconsistent with a prior statement made by the witness, even though the rest or most of the rest of the witness's evidence is favourable to the party calling him. 

11Mr O'Sullivan accepted, in the light of the further attempts by the Crown to obtain the evidence in paragraph 7, that there was now a clear inconsistency between his oral evidence and the evidence in the Statement. I consider further, in the light of the relevant offence charged (solicit to murder) that the oral evidence of the witness was unfavourable to the Crown. A proper basis was therefore available under either paragraph (a) or (c) of s 38 to permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

12In giving the leave sought under this section regard is to be had amongst other things to the matters in s 192 Evidence Act . 

13In my opinion, the nature of the proceedings (a trial on a charge of soliciting to murder) and the importance of the evidence in relation to that charge make it appropriate to grant the leave sought. I do not consider that it would unfair to the Accused to permit that when the evidence was otherwise contained in the Statement signed by the witness. 

14The Crown is permitted to cross-examine in relation to paragraphs 7 and 8 of Mr Maiava's Statement.

7 July 2006
 
V K Rajah J:
1          The appellant, Tan Kay Beng (“Tan”), pleaded guilty to a charge of theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”), as well as to another charge of criminal intimidation under the second limb of s 506 of the PC. The victim in both instances was Wong Loke Hoon (“Wong”), and both offences were committed on the evening of 8 February 2004. The district judge sentenced Tan to 12 months’ imprisonment on the theft conviction and to 21 months’ imprisonment on the conviction of criminal intimidation. Tan appealed against both sentences on the ground that they were manifestly excessive.
2          It is noteworthy that when the appeal came up for hearing, the prosecution neither justified nor defended the sentence meted out for the theft charge. It did however attempt to justify the sentence for the conviction on criminal intimidation although conceding in the concluding submissions that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment might be more appropriate. I allowed the appellant’s appeal against both sentences on the basis that they were manifestly excessive. For the theft conviction, I substituted a fine of $1,000 (in default, two weeks’ imprisonment) for the original term of imprisonment. For the conviction of criminal intimidation, I substituted a term of imprisonment of three months for the original sentence of 21 months. I now set out my reasons.
The facts
3          Tan, 41 years of age, is the sole proprietor of “Tiong Poh & Co” a business which supplies traditional Chinese paraphernalia for funerals, weddings, and prayers. His business is stable and he does not have any current financial problems.
4          At some point in October 2003, Wong requested that Tan supply 20 pieces of “Japan Velvet” silk screens. The price for these items was agreed at $880 and Wong placed a deposit of $80 with Tan. This order was purportedly placed on behalf of the management of OP KTV, Wong’s principal. Tan promptly processed the order. However, just prior to the delivery of the items, OP KTV ceased business. Wong then pointedly refused to pay Tan for the screens, insisting that Tan should claim payment from his “boss”. He told Tan that as far as he was concerned he had neither any further interest nor any remaining responsibility for the outstanding debt. Upset by his nonchalant stance, Tan insisted that Wong remain responsible for payment. To no avail. Wong insouciantly ignored all his requests for payment.
5          This impasse prevailed until Tan met, by pure chance on 8 February 2004, John, a former customer of his, at a food centre. Tan bitterly complained to John about Wong’s cavalier attitude towards the outstanding debt. John offered to assist Tan in collecting the outstanding amount and to meet Wong. Tan then contacted Wong asking if they could meet. Wong agreed, informing Tan where he was. Tan thereafter proceeded to the coffee shop, accompanied by John and the latter’s companion. It bears emphasis that the prosecution did not intimate that Tan had any preconceived plan on how he or John intended to persuade Wong to effect payment. There was no prior discussion to threaten or intimidate Wong.
6          Tan and John attempted to reason with Wong that he ought to make payment for the silk screens but were unable to make any headway in reaching an amicable resolution. Suddenly out of frustration Tan banged the table. Wong in turn immediately stood up and held up his beer mug in a menacing posture.
7          In response to Wong’s aggressive reaction, John immediately procured a bread knife from the coffee shop kitchen and pointed it at Wong’s neck. He demanded that Wong put down the beer mug but the latter initially refused to do so. With the knife pointed at Wong’s neck, John then demanded that Wong hand over his possessions in order to settle the debt due to Tan. Wong complied by placing his waist pouch on the table. Tan opened the pouch, removing cash amounting to $166 and a Nokia 8210 mobile phone that has been valued at $100. Tan however returned the SIM card to Wong.
8          John’s companion then duly returned the bread knife to the coffee shop kitchen, after which Tan and his two companions then left the scene. Throughout this brief incident the other patrons in the coffee shop appeared unaffected and carried on with their meals. Subsequently, the police apprehended Tan and the items he took from Wong were duly recovered. John and his friend remain at large and have not been prosecuted.
Decision of the District Court
9          The learned district judge observed in his decision (
[2006] SGDC 25
) that while Tan had no prior record for theft or criminal intimidation, he had an antecedent for gaming in a common gaming house for which he had been fined $1,000. The learned district judge appeared, without any adequate explanation, to have taken into account as a sentencing consideration this prior conviction of gaming. He stated rather cryptically at [12] that, “[t]hough the accused had no prior criminal record for theft and criminal intimidation, this was not the accused’s first [brush] with the law”. He also seemed to have adopted an uncompromising view that while Tan had pleaded guilty to both charges at the first opportunity, the offences committed were serious and attracted severe penalties.
10        The learned district judge noted that the confrontation that evening “was a confrontation of one person by a group of three”. In his view the number of persons could have resulted in the greater likelihood of harm especially since one member of the group was armed. He stated at [11]:
It is accepted that group pressure and group dynamics may make the offence less likely to be abandoned and could lead to greater harm being caused to the victim or damage being caused. In 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 the Hon Chief Justice held –
14 … Any participation whatsoever, irrespective of its precise form, in an unlawful assembly of this type derives its gravity from becoming one of those who, by weight of numbers, pursued a common and unlawful object. The law of this country has always leaned heavily against those who, attain such purpose, use the threat that lies in the power of numbers. See also 
Caird (1970) 54
 
Cr App R 499
 at page 507, and 
Mac Cormack 
[1981] VR 104
 at page 108”
and again, further, at [13]:
… The manner in which the offence was committed smacked of organization. The accused clearly played an active and prominent role in the commission of the commission [
sic
] of the theft. … It could not be ignored that the theft was committed under threatening circumstances as Wong was held at knifepoint was told to remove his waist pouch [
sic
]. The knife, if used as a weapon of offence, could cause serious injury or death. The fact that a knife was threateningly used also aggravated the nature of the offence of criminal intimidation.
11        He then relied on the decision on 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
 
[2002] 2 SLR 98
 (“
Luan Yuanxin
”) as the benchmark authority for the proposition that the use of a weapon invariably justified a deterrent custodial sentence. In that case, a distinction was drawn between criminal intimidation 
simpliciter
 and aggravated intimidation emphasising that “the presence of a weapon serves not only to make the threat more menacing, but also goes towards proving the maker’s intent to cause alarm to his victim.”
12        The learned district judge further assessed the fact that the offences were committed in a public place as an important sentencing consideration; see [17]:
[I]t is foreseeable that acts of breaching the public peace in a public place in full view of members of the public would have caused alarm and fear to those who witnessed the incident. The Court also took into consideration this fact in determining sentence. The place of the commission of the offence was taken into consideration in sentencing by the learned Senior District Judge in 
PP v Diki Zulkarnaini
. He stated –
“16.      Account may be taken, for the purpose of sentencing of the nature of the premises and scene where the incident took place. See 
Director of Public Prosecutions v Cotcher
 (1992) 
The Times, 29 December 1992.
”
13        The learned district judge’s concluding remarks appear to have been profoundly influenced and engendered by what he perceived as wider public interest considerations meriting a deterrent sentence “necessary to deter the accused and like minded offenders from taking matters into their own hands and to [
sic
] resorting to openly committing offences”.
The purported aggravating factors
Antecedents
14        An antecedent is a relevant and important sentencing consideration if it is similar to the pending charge. It may then reflect a pattern or tendency for repeat offending. Both general and specific deterrence could then become almost inexorable sentencing considerations. However, dissimilar antecedents are by and large of no relevance. In 
Roslan bin Abdul Rahman v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 211
, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery causing death under s 394 read with s 397 of the PC. In sentencing, the trial judge took into account as a sentencing consideration the appellant’s drug-related antecedents. The Court of Appeal unhesitatingly held that the trial judge should not have done so. Karthigesu JA observed at [14]:
The learned trial judge had proceeded on wrong principles. The appellant’s drug-related antecedents should have no bearing on the present trial as it was completely unrelated to the offence the appellant was charged with. The appellant had no antecedents of offences related to the type of offence he was charged with. The fact that the appellant was a drug addict did not necessarily imply that he was more prone to commit the offence of armed robbery with hurt.
15        Thomas, in 
Principles of Sentencing: The Sentencing Policy of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division
 (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979), explains at p 203:
The existence of a difference between the immediate offence and those recorded against the offender in the past … can be seen, despite the earlier offences, as an isolated departure from normal patterns of behaviour. Where the offence seems to be a deliberate excursion into a previously unexplored area of criminal behaviour, the difference between the present and previous offences will 
carry less weight.
 [emphasis added]
16        It is important to note that this is not to say that dissimilar antecedents can never be a relevant sentencing consideration. For instance dissimilar antecedents that clearly manifest a marked and progressive proclivity towards criminal activity or a cavalier disregard for the law could be relevant. I respectfully agree with the observations of Chief Justice Yong Pung How in 
Leong Mun Kwai v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 338
 at 342, [19]:
The effect that these convictions have on sentencing in any case must depend on the facts of the case. In my view, relevant considerations would be the number and nature of these previous convictions. Similarly, for convictions which occurred a long time ago, it would also be relevant to consider the length of time during which the defendant has maintained a blemish-free record. All these are part and parcel of the convicted person’s antecedents which the court should take into account.
17        In this context I also consider it profitable to acknowledge and pay heed to the incisive observations of the High Court of Australia in 
Veen v The Queen
 [No 2] 164 CLR 465 at 477–478:
… the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instance case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner’s claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.
18        Tan’s previous conviction was for illegal gambling. As for the current convictions of theft and criminal intimidation, these arose solely out of his discord and unhappiness with Wong. There has been no suggestion that Tan is prone to or has been involved in any other manner of criminal activity. A person who gambles at a common gambling house does not inevitably graduate to acts of theft or criminal intimidation. His sole antecedent is clearly not an aggravating factor and is in fact entirely irrelevant as a sentencing consideration in this particular case. All said and done the learned district judge erred in choosing to allude to this antecedent given the clearly established legal position on this aspect of sentencing.
Pressure by a Group
19        The learned district judge also cited 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
 as authority for the following proposition:
Any participation whatsoever, irrespective of its precise form, in an unlawful assembly of this type derives its gravity from becoming one of those who, by weight of numbers, pursued a common and unlawful object. The law of this country has always leaned heavily against those who, [to] attain such [a] purpose, use the threat that lies in the power of numbers. See also

This quotation has been inaccurately attributed to 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
. It should have been attributed to 
Caird
 (1970) 54 Cr App R 499 at 507. It is also germane to note in this context that 
Caird
 was a decision dealing with violent demonstrations: see [24] below. Indeed, the High Court has applied 
Caird
 only in cases where the offender was charged with and convicted of rioting: 
Phua Song Hua v Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] SGHC 33
; 
Pannirselvam s/o Anthonisamy v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 1 SLR 784
.
 Rioting is a far cry from the factual matrix of the present appeal. Therefore, even at the most general level, 
Caird
 is not instructive in this case.
20        More pertinently, 
Caird
 does not stand for the proposition that any and all offences committed by a group will invariably attract sentences of greater severity than if the offences were committed by an individual. To elaborate, a careful reading of 
Caird
 will reveal that the dictum cited above (at [19]) was in the context of addressing a submission by counsel that the individual offences committed by the applicants ought to be viewed in isolation for sentencing purposes and that the trial judge should not have taken into account the gravity of the total wreckage caused by the entire assembly as a whole. The English Court of Appeal, at 507, unhesitatingly rejected this audacious submission as “a failure to appreciate that on these confused and tumultuous occasions each individual who takes an 
active part by deed or encouragement
 is guilty of a really grave offence by being 
one of the number engaged in a crime
 against the peace.” In other words, a participant who 
engages in
 a 
riot
 or 
mob
 causes harm to others not only through his individual acts of violence but by his involvement in a group that, in turn, multiplies the effect of his individual acts of violence. To put it in yet another way, a participant in such violent demonstrations cannot be heard to accept responsibility only for his own actions; he is morally culpable for the totality of the consequences that the demonstration causes. After all, it is the intention of every rioter that the magnitude of his conduct be amplified by the similarly violent or improper conduct of others. Herein lies the subtle but critical point: the gist of the holding in 
Caird
 is not that every offence committed 
in a group
 should be punished more severely than if the offence were committed by the offender alone; it is that when an individual actively engages in 
group violence
, a proportionate sentence for each participant should include consideration of the net effect of that group violence. Simply put, there may be violence committed in a group (by an individual who has taken things into his own hands) but this does not mean that the entire group, as a whole, has decided on or commenced on a course of violence for which all the group’s members must be inevitably held severally and jointly liable for each other’s actions.
21        To cross the threshold, it is necessary to show that the offender has played an active part in the violence either by deed or by encouragement: 
Caird
 at 507. It is also sufficient to prove that rioters who may have refrained from joining in the physical assault of a victim or damage of property nonetheless shared in the common object of the unlawful assembly: 
Pannirselvam s/o Anthonisamy
 at [72], endorsing 
Rajasekaran s/o Armuthelingam v PP
 
[2001] SGDC 175
.
 However, it must be remembered that even where the principle in 
Caird
 applies, it “does not inexorably imply that the role of the accused, relative to other offenders, can never be taken into account”: 
Phua Song Hua
 at [40]. For purposes of sentencing Tan in the present appeal, I have found there was no organisation or plan to criminally intimidate and steal from Wong: see [28] below. Accordingly, the principle in 
Caird
 has no application in this case. Place of crime
Place of Crime
22        The learned district judge considered an observation from 
PP v Diki Zulkarnaini bin Saini
 District Arrest Case Nos 57026 of 2000, 289 of 2001 and 5608 of 2001 (2001, unreported) (“
Zulkarnaini
”) as an authority for the proposition that offences committed in public places merit deterrent sentences. In that case, the accused pleaded guilty, 
inter alia,
 to a charge of rioting. He was a member of an unlawful assembly at the Accident and Emergency Department of Singapore General Hospital (“A&E Department”), that intended to assault the victim, who was seated outside the A&E Department at six in the morning. It is of course incontrovertible that offences involving any violence or which cause harm in a hospital will attract serious consequences and to that extent I have no difficulty with this aspect of the decision.
23        It will nonetheless be helpful to set out the relevant passage in 
Zulkarnaini
’s case that explains the context in which these observations were made:
There was a brazen disdain for the protective place for the sick and wounded shown by the accused and his accomplices. There was likely fear and vulnerability at the A & E Department, Singapore General Hospital. In deliberately proceeding to the Department to seek out their victim, and rampaging through and around the Department armed with weapons, the accused and his accomplices have, in effect, wantonly endangered the lives of vulnerable innocent persons. … [T]he Department 
is a particularly sensitive area of any hospital, dealing with cases of an urgent and often life-threatening nature
. [emphasis added]
24        I pause to emphasise that both 
Zulkarnaini
 and 
Caird
 constitute instances of rioting and affray. 
Caird
’s case, in particular, was a decision relating to the [in]famous Garden House riots in February 1970 in Cambridge. 
Zulkarnaini
’s case involved an attack in a hospital; not just 
any
 ordinary public place, but a place of peculiar sanctity to which the law accords particular and benevolent protection. In 
Caird
’s case, there were violent demonstrations and clashes with the police, resulting in a disruption to legitimate public activities and damage to public property. These are all factors that are conspicuously absent in the present case. To that extent neither of these decisions can afford any particular assistance in assessing the appropriate sentencing considerations for the instant case. Indeed, neither of these decisions strikes me as tangentially relevant and I fail to see why the learned district judge referred to them. Counsel had not cited them.
25        The fact that an offence is committed in public cannot 
ipso facto
 be an aggravating factor. Conversely, an offence committed in private cannot inevitably or invariably be viewed as meriting more lenient treatment. That is not to say that the location of an incident is irrelevant. Clearly it can be a relevant sentencing consideration and often is. 
But it need not invariably be so.
 In fact, to accede to such a principle would send the palpably wrong message that criminal intimidation in private places will be more leniently dealt with. There can be no reason in principle why a person who corners another in a non-public place and takes advantage of the fact that there will be no one around to assist should be put in a better position than someone with the temerity to intimidate another in public. Criminal intimidation, whether in public or not, is equally and always reprehensible. A court must not adopt a mechanical approach in appraising the relevance of various sentencing criteria. Sentencing does not simply translate into the blind application of a judicial checklist to the factual matrix. It is a process that mandates the sound application of judicial discretion taking into account the 
entire
 factual matrix. The emphasis to be given and accorded to various criteria must necessarily vary from case to case and may even differ in the same factual matrix in its application to the different individuals involved in an incident. In the present case, the incident was quintessentially an incident involving Tan’s party on the one hand and Wong on the other. There was no affray. The facts do not suggest that the public was disturbed in any way. The level of public fear or alarm generated by an incident is a relevant sentencing consideration; 
Regina v Cunningham
 
[1993] 1 WLR 183
 at 187. There must however be some evidential basis from which this inference can be drawn. The prosecution has failed to adduce any evidence inviting any inference that this brief incident caused alarm either to the coffee shop’s patrons or to any member of the public.
Organised crime
26        The fact that an offence was committed by a group of persons should not ineluctably be equated with organisation or planning. Planning could be present in offences committed by individuals. Organisation could conversely be lacking in offences committed by groups. Mobs, by any definition, lack any element of coordination or planning. They often coalesce as a consequence of misplaced spontaneity.
27        Tan’s party of three cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as a mob. Nor can it be viewed as an example of participants in organised crime. This epithet should be reserved for more heinous offences involving some form of real organisation, system or planning. There is no evidence that Tan and his companions organised or planned to criminally intimidate Wong or to steal his property. Nowhere in the agreed Statement of Facts (“SOF”) is there any evidence suggesting prior deliberation in the commission of the offences.
28        The incident at the coffee shop conjures the image of hot-blooded individuals acting impulsively. Critically, no one in Tan’s party came armed with a weapon. The bread knife that was employed was procured from the coffee shop itself. Suggesting that Tan and his companions organised and planned to criminally intimidate and steal from Wong at the very outset requires a total suspension of disbelief. More crucially, this is not the prosecution’s case.
Deterrence as a sentencing consideration
29        It is often said that in arriving at an appropriate sentence, a court should invariably take into account the sentencing considerations of deterrence, retribution, prevention and rehabilitation. It is however less often noted that these principles are not always complementary and indeed may even engender conflicting consequences when mechanically applied in the process of sentencing. In practice, judges often place emphasis on one or more sentencing considerations in preference to, and sometimes even to the exclusion of all the other remaining considerations. When this occurs, it is imperative for the court to adequately articulate the justification underpinning the sentence meted out and in particular to explicate its preference for certain particular sentencing considerations over others.
30        In the present case, the trial judge placed considerable and, if I may add, an undue premium on the deterrence principle, to the apparent exclusion of all other sentencing considerations cursorily alluded to at the outset. Unfortunately, he did not fully articulate his reasons for prizing deterrence over the other sentencing principles in this case.
31        Deterrence must always be tempered by proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed as well as by the moral and legal culpability of the offender. It is axiomatic that a court must abstain from gratuitous loading in sentences. Deterrence, as a concept, has a multi-faceted dimension and it is inappropriate to invoke it without a proper appreciation of how and when it should be applied. It is premised upon the upholding of certain statutory or public policy concerns or alternatively, upon judicial concern or disquiet about the prevalence of particular offences and the attendant need to prevent such offences from becoming contagious. Deterrence, as a general sentencing principle, is also intended to create an awareness in the public and more particularly among potential offenders that punishment will be certain and unrelenting for certain offences and offenders.
32        Deterrence however also has a more specific application. Specific deterrence is directed at persuading a particular offender from contemplating further mischief. This assumes that a potential offender can balance and weigh consequences before committing an offence. The deterrent function may therefore be weak or non-existent when formulating an appropriate sentence for mentally handicapped or unwell persons. In such cases, as well as instances when a court is persuaded that an offender is unlikely to re-offend, specific deterrence fails to qualify as a relevant consideration, let alone a crucial one.
33        In specific cases, even in the absence of a compelling need for specific deterrence, general deterrence could be the context in which stiff sentences are anchored, given the imperative of upholding law and public order. Granting that concerns of law and public order are indeed crucial considerations in sentencing, this alone however does not provide a licence for unreasonable or unreasoned sentences. There is in the final analysis, an overriding constitutional and public interest imperative warranting that individuals are not unfairly sentenced. All said and done, it would however be wrong to consider that the mandates of law and order on the one hand and the right of the offender to be fairly treated on the other are inimically irreconcilable. It is the duty and obligation of the sentencing judge to assess and balance these competing concerns and to strike an appropriate balance between the two.
34        In sentencing a particular offender, both general and specific deterrence must be scrupulously assessed and measured in the context of that particular factual matrix before deciding exactly how and to what extent each should figure in the equation. While there is neither any magic formula nor any neat and precise calibration to apply in the process, it is however, clearly insufficient to merely 
allude
 to deterrence as the basis for imposing a stiff sentence, especially in instances where it is invoked as a principal sentencing consideration or when existing guidelines are not followed. In such instances, the precise reasons for invoking deterrence or for choosing to depart from existing guidelines together with the attendant judicial concerns must be clearly and unambiguously articulated. Arbitrary or inadequate reliance on “deterrence” as nothing more than a stock phrase for want of something better fails to discharge the onerous judicial responsibility of ensuring that while a sentence meted out unequivocally conveys the court’s assessment of the relevant considerations the offender’s position has also been fairly and reasonably assessed.
Mitigating factors
Pleading guilty and restitution
35        Though the lower court acknowledged that Tan had pleaded guilty, it is unclear from the judgment whether any weight was accorded to this. The severity of the sentences imposed indicates that the learned district judge did not take this factor into account in his final reckoning.
36        Our settled sentencing jurisprudence recognises that a timeously-effected plea of guilt merits a sentencing discount in certain situations. A guilty plea is relevant as a mitigation factor (a) when the plea of guilt is a genuine act of contrition – see 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
 at [26] and (b) when resources which would otherwise be expended at trial are saved – see 
Krishan Chand v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 291
 at 293, [6] and Andrew Ashworth, 
Sentencing and Criminal Justice
 (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1995) at p 137. The discount given may range between a quarter to a third of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence though this is by no means either a hard and fast rule nor an entitlement – see 
eg
, 
Fu Foo Tong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
 at 455, [13].
37        It is pertinent to note that the value of a guilty plea is substantially attenuated when (a) the plea is tactical – see 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
 (
supra
); (b) there is no other choice but to plead guilty – see 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
; and (c) where the public interest considerations nevertheless necessitate a deterrent sentence – see 
Fu Foo Tong v PP
 (
supra
).
38        Closely related to the plea of guilt is the act or fact of restitution: the restoration of the status quo apropos either an accused who has been unjustly enriched or a victim who has been improperly deprived of an asset by a criminal act. Restitution can be viewed as a manifestation of contrition accompanying a genuine plea of guilt – see 
Krishan Chand v PP
 (
supra
). Restitution engendered purely by an expectation of a lighter sentence may however sometimes be coloured by the same consideration as a tactically-made plea of guilt – see 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
 at [9]. Restitution arising from apprehension, as in this case, should not be viewed as an act of contrition.
Determining the appropriate sentence
39        
Regina v Howells
 
[1999] 1 WLR 307
 is an important decision where the English Court of Appeal considered the relevant factors to be taken into account in meting out custodial sentences. Courts should usually approach custodial sentencing by balancing the nature of the accused’s moral culpability and the extent of the damage or injury caused to the victim versus wider public interest considerations. 
Ceteris paribus
, an offence that manifests deliberation is usually more serious than one which is spontaneous. Furthermore, the infliction of personal injury or psychological trauma will be viewed even more seriously if an injury is permanent. Lord Bingham CJ (as he then was) with his customary acuity noted at 312:
Courts should always bear in mind that criminal sentences are in almost every case intended to protect the public, whether by punishing the offender or reforming him, or deterring him and others, or all of these things. Courts cannot and should not be unmindful of the important public dimension of criminal sentencing and the importance of maintaining public confidence in the sentencing system.
Where the court is of the opinion that an offence, or the combination of an offence and one or more offences associated with it, is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified and that such a sentence should be passed, the sentence imposed should be no longer than is necessary to meet the penal purpose which the court has in mind.
40        In scrutinising and reviewing the cases that the learned district judge appraised in deciding upon the appropriate sentence, I cannot, regrettably, but conclude that most of them were plainly distinguishable from the instant scenario; indeed they were on the whole quite irrelevant. I also note that the prosecution did not cite the authorities he relied on. I now turn to examine the actual sentencing precedents in tandem with some of the precedents he relied on.
Sentencing precedents for criminal intimidation
41        In the case of 
Ramanathan Yogendran v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 563
, where a sentence of six months’ imprisonment was imposed, the appellant had an argument with the victim the day before he threatened to kill him. The appellant called the victim over the telephone, hurled repeated abuses at him, threatened to go to his home to assault him and then kill him. The threat was a very real one.
42        
Luan Yuanxin
 (
supra
 [11]) was a case exemplifying 
extreme
 domestic violence. The appellant threatened the victim (his wife) with a 20cm-long meat cleaver. He uttered a death threat to her whilst brandishing the weapon. He then attempted to carry out that threat the very next day. In 
Chua Siew Lin v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 497
 (“
Chua
”), the court emphasised that 
Luan Yuanxin
 should be employed as a sentencing precedent 
only with caution
. In 
Chua’s
 case, the offender, an employer, pressed a kitchen knife against the collarbone of the victim, a maid. The accused was handed a term of four months’ imprisonment for criminal intimidation. On appeal, notwithstanding the policy of deterrence generally and painstakingly applied to maid abuse cases, the sentence was reduced to two months.
43        In assessing the appropriate sentence in 
Chua
’s case, the court also considered the case of 
PP v Tan Beng Hoe
 
[2002] SGDC 121
.
 This was another case of marital violence where the accused had used a chopping knife to confront the victim, his wife. He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. In distinguishing the earlier case of 
Luan Yuanxin
 from the factual matrix in 
PP v Tan Beng Hoe
 case, the learned district judge in that case correctly noted at [12]:
[T]he respondent in that case had demonstrated that he was clearly not incapable of carrying out his threats to kill the victim. He had deliberately carried out his threat with the use of a weapon, and had gone further to attack the victim by strangling and biting her, causing her serious physical injuries and for which she was given three days medical leave. Thus, the unprovoked, violent and vicious acts of the respondent in that case were premeditated and prolonged, which warranted a far more severe sentence.
It is plain to me that the learned district judge in this case was mistaken in applying 
Luan Yuanxin
 to the present factual matrix. Those rather remarkable circumstances are far removed from the instant context.
44        The decision in 
Lwee Kwi Ling Mary v Quek Chin Huat
 
[2003] 2 SLR 145
 affords some assistance. In that case, the offender threatened to kill the victim whilst holding a chopper. The two protagonists had an argument over rent resulting in a scuffle between the offender’s husband and the victim. The court opined that when a death threat was uttered, a sentence of at least six months was ordinarily warranted. However, the court was of the view that the circumstances supported a departure from the rule. Firstly, the offender only threatened the victim when the latter was involved in a scuffle with her husband. Secondly, the victim refused to leave the offender’s flat. Thirdly, the victim did not appear to have been alarmed by the threat. The court then sentenced the appellant to three months’ imprisonment.
45        The prosecution also drew my attention to the following passage from 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 217:
A distinction is drawn between criminal intimidation 
simpliciter
 and an aggravated form of criminal intimidation that attracts a higher punishment. For purposes of sentencing, the nature of the threat, the context in which it was uttered, and the effect on the victim are the most significant factors.
If the victim is not only alarmed by the threat but had feared for his or her safety, that is an aggravating factor that goes towards the seriousness of the offence: 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
 
[2002] 2 SLR 98
.
If the threat was with a weapon or was accompanied by a weapon, a term of custody will be inevitable. The presence of the [weapon] serves not only to make the threat more menacing, but also goes towards proving the maker’s intent to cause alarm to his victim 
(PP v Luan Yuanxin).
A threat to cause death falls within the second limb. Where the threat to kill is without a weapon, the sentencing range for offenders with no prior record is between six to 12 months’ imprisonment. Where a weapon was used as part of the threat to cause death, a term of two years’ imprisonment was imposed by the High Court in two recent cases.
If the threat is to injure seriously or if it is committed in the course of assault or other criminal conduct, a term of custody can also be expected.
If the threat was uttered in the heat of the moment or if it was not of a particularly serious nature, the offence is likely to dealt with by a fine.
Threats uttered in the context of domestic abuse are treated severely (see 
PP v N
 
[1999] 4 SLR 619
 and 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
).
I accept this conspectus as general encapsulation of current sentencing practices for this type of offence, with one qualification. While 
prima facie
 it is correct to assert that aggravated criminal intimidation will attract higher punishment the sentence meted out must be tempered by both proportionality and just as crucially by the specific factual matrix. I stress in addition that these passages are to be viewed as no more than guidelines and should neither be religiously applied nor adhered to mechanically. In the final analysis it must be acknowledged that sentencing precedents function purely as an aid so that consistency in sentencing may be maintained. General consistency in sentencing while desirable is not an overriding sentencing consideration. The factual matrix always remains paramount. Unfortunately, the learned district judge appears to have paid little heed to these guidelines in his misguided attempt to impose severely deterrent sentences on Tan. While he was at liberty to depart from these guidelines, he failed to articulate any basis or rationale for so doing. There was no apparent attempt to identify distinctions between the appellant’s offences and comparable offences and offenders.
46        In the present case, it ought to be noted that no death threat was uttered at any point. Further, the SOF significantly failed to incorporate any facts suggesting or asserting that Wong assumed or felt that his life was in danger. Nor is there any evidence of the distance at which the knife was being held. John was the main perpetrator brandishing the knife. Tan never suggested procuring the knife. Nor did he handle it at any point. Be that as it may, it must be acknowledged and recognised that pointing a knife at anyone, even in the absence of any threats, would be sufficient to cause serious alarm (at the very least) to any reasonable person. There can be no question that the knife was pointed at Wong to threaten him with the prospect of harm and to induce in him fear for his physical safety. While the original intent in pointing the knife at Wong may have been conceived in a misguided response to his aggressive behaviour, this act soon transmuted itself into a full-blown act of criminal intimidation culminating in Wong being coerced to part company with his money and handphone.
47        There is one further point. The learned district judge appeared at some points of his grounds of decision to consider Tan the principal offender and initiator. At [11], he made the following observation:
It was noted that, the accused in committing the offences had, on the night in question, 
willingly enlisted the assistance of two accomplices
 to proceed with him to the Starlight Coffee shop to discuss matters with Wong. [emphasis added]
What did the learned district judge mean by referring to the ‘two accomplices’? It was not the prosecution’s case that when Tan sought John’s assistance there was an understanding that improper means would be relied on in order to collect the debt. From the SOF it is abundantly clear that Tan did not initiate the chain of events that culminated in the commission of the offences. It was John who procured the bread knife. That said, it cannot be gainsaid that Tan became a willing participant and accomplice to the commission of the offences. Indeed, the accused accepts this. However, in terms of culpability, Tan cannot be ranked alongside John even though he would have been the beneficiary of those acts. It appears that the learned district judge viewed Tan as the principal transgressor and his companions as mere accomplices. The SOF does not support this characterisation.
Sentencing precedents for minor theft
48        In so far as the theft conviction is in issue, a case in point is 
Chua Gin Synn v PP
 
[2003] 2 SLR 179
 (“
Chua Gin Synn
”). In that case, the appellant pleaded guilty to one charge of theft of several items amounting in value to $259.70. The court considered four cases in determining the appropriate sentence.
49        First, 
PP v Innasimuthu s/o D M
 
[2001] SGDC 115
.
 The value of the stolen items was $838 and the sentence was four months. Second, 
PP v Nurashikin bte Ahmad Borhan
 
[2003] 1 SLR 52
.
 The value of the item was $9.70 and the term of imprisonment was two weeks. In both cases the accused had criminal antecedents. Third, 
PP v Roddie A K Belamy
 Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 7705 of 2002 (2002, unreported). Ten items worth $113.90 were stolen. The sentence was two weeks’ imprisonment. Last, 
PP v Sekharamantri Sairam Patnaik
 Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 5941 of 2002 (2002, unreported). $84.30 worth of items was stolen. A fine of $2000 was imposed. In the last two cases, the offenders had no relevant criminal record. In 
Chua Gin Synn
, the court imposed a fine of $2,000 in lieu of imprisonment in light of the four precedents. These cases buttress the view expressed in 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
, 
supra
 at p 340 that “[i]n cases where the value of the stolen item is low (below $1,000) and the offender has a previous clean record, the sentence imposed will usually be a fine”. In the present case, Tan has no relevant antecedents and the value of the property was relatively little. There is little reason to depart from the sentencing guidelines.
Conclusion
50        There are a number of attenuating factors in this case which the learned district judge regrettably appears to have neither acknowledged nor taken into consideration. First, the appellant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. This appeared to be a genuine expression of remorse. Second, the victim was fully restituted even though in the circumstances this cannot be viewed as an act of contrition. Rather, the relevance of the restitution is that the crime did not cause any financial loss to Wong. This ought to have also been taken into account. Third, the appellant promptly and fully co-operated with the authorities. Fourth, the appellant is a happily-married man with a stable business. The absence of any relevant criminal record, a stable family life and a history of continuous employment together with his heartfelt expression of remorse for what appears to have been an impulsive criminal act ought to be accorded some weightage in this case. In so far as the issue of specific deterrence is relevant, I am convinced that a short custodial sentence not only will suffice, it will leave both a profound and indelible impression on the appellant. That said, one cannot ignore that certain adverse factors also prevail in this case. First, a weapon was used in the commission of the offences. Second, the offences were committed by Tan in concert with others in order to collect a debt. That is entirely unacceptable. Regardless of whether the debt was legitimately due to Tan, such an act of taking the law into one’s hands complemented or supplemented by the threat of harm, actual or otherwise, must be deplored and denounced unequivocally through a custodial sentence.
51        All said and done, I am persuaded that the learned district judge made several errors in his grounds of decision in determining the appropriate sentence. He failed to accord any consideration to the plea of guilt. He placed undue emphasis on the purported organisation and planning involved in the incident. He also erred in concluding that this was a confrontation by three persons against a single person. The SOF makes it abundantly clear that Wong was having a meal with his friends. He was not alone. Finally, the appellant’s prior antecedent for gaming was an altogether irrelevant consideration. Several of the sentencing precedents that the learned district judge relied on relate to cases of rioting and organised crime and are to that extent wholly irrelevant. The learned district judge also appears to have placed far too much emphasis on the issue of general deterrence. I wholeheartedly accept that general deterrence in a case of this nature is a significant consideration that cannot be overlooked. Individuals cannot take the law into their own hands or draw up their own rules of conduct to govern their commercial relationships. To turn a blind eye or to view such conduct as benign would be tantamount to condoning it that might in turn be the thin end of the wedge for both law and order, and legitimate commercial intercourse. That said, the application of the principle of general deterrence should usually be tempered with proportionality and a notion of fairness to the accused as well save where public interest unyieldingly dictates otherwise. As far as personal and specific deterrence is concerned it was amply clear given Tan’s remorse and background that even a short custodial sentence will prove to be a searing experience that will surely leave an indelible impression on him.
52        There is no suggestion from the prosecution that Tan has any prospective proclivity for sliding into criminal activity. He maintains a small but stable business that depends entirely on his physical presence and know-how. The public does not need to be protected from him. What is called for is an appropriate sentence that adequately calibrates and signifies the unacceptable and serious nature of the offences. His conduct should be denounced without destroying his business and family life. He should be given the opportunity to pick up the pieces. A long custodial sentence would have the inevitable and altogether deleterious effect of destroying the livelihood of a legitimate and otherwise respectable businessman. That would not be appropriate in this case.
53        In this case, a custodial sentence is clearly and undeniably warranted although it must be circumscribed by fairness and underpinned by public interest considerations. An appropriate sentence in a case such as this must be consistent with the overriding concern and need to protect the interests of the public and to adequately punish and deter the specific individual. It is sometimes not adequately appreciated that a significant number of offenders can be as justly and effectively dealt with by a shorter custodial sentence rather than a longer one. These are persons who are not ever likely to offend again. A distinction must be drawn between dangerous offenders and potential recidivists on the one hand and offenders who are unlikely to ever offend again on the other hand. In the latter case, unless there is an unequivocal or a compelling need to publicly denounce the crime or the offender with a stiff sentence the courts should be slow to unnecessarily and perhaps even arbitrarily invoke the mantle of deterrence, simply to justify long custodial sentences that over amplify the message of general deterrence. I also note that in this case the prosecution had not even sought that a deterrent sentence be imposed to begin with. There is of course no requirement in law for the prosecution to apply for deterrent sentencing before a court may consider it in the exercise of its discretion; 
PP v Gurmit Singh
 
[1999] 3 SLR 215
 at [9]. That said, a court must always exercise scrupulous caution and measured prudence before relying on or employing a sentencing consideration that has not been the subject of submission or contention by counsel and thus tested by the anvil of argument. The learned district judge also relied on questionable assumptions. He departed from a cardinal principle of sentencing that an offender must be punished on the basis of the facts of the case and not on the basis that he has committed a particular offence.
54        Considering that the term of imprisonment for the theft charge was to run concurrently, a fine in lieu of imprisonment is more appropriate in this case. Indeed the severe but concurrent jail sentence for this relatively minor act of theft appears in my view to be not only unsupported by any sentencing authority but is in the final analysis quite meaningless as it would not have to be served separately. It is an inappropriate paper sentence that lacked both proportionality and bite.
55        In the result, the sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment on the charge of criminal intimidation was reduced to three months. The sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the conviction of theft was substituted with a fine of $1,000 and in default thereof, a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment.",2006-07-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

1BASTEN JA: I agree with Blanch J. 

2BLANCH J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision of his Honour Judge Black in the District Court at Lismore on 31 October 2011.

3The respondent appeared for trial on an indictment alleging that between 29 June 2007 and 1 July 2007 he committed two offences of indecent assault contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 and two offences of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 contrary to s61J Crimes Act 1900.

4The Crown case was that the complainant, a 12 year old girl, stayed over at the home of her friend who was the daughter of the respondent. She said that her friend went to bed and the respondent then indecently assaulted her and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. There was some evidence of complaint to a girlfriend in 2007 and also to a boyfriend. The complainant was not interviewed by police until 29 January 2009.

5At trial the Crown sought to lead evidence of admissions made by the respondent to hospital staff and to Mr Greg Telford, an employee of the Department of Community Services, after he presented himself to the Emergency Department of Lismore Base Hospital.

6The first piece of evidence sought to be led was a statement from Dr Petroff, a consultant psychiatrist who identified a form filled in by him on 2 October 2007. That form noted a confession by the respondent that he "",... sexually abused his daughter's 13 year old friend some months ago..."" and noted the girl had abused him and he was terrified of going to gaol and was threatening to kill himself if discharged. The doctor ticked a box saying the respondent ""is a mentally disordered person"" and directed he be kept in casualty and treated.

7The second piece of evidence was a statement from Denis Casey, a clinical nurse at the hospital and he identified the medical notes he made relating to the respondent and said they accurately reflected what the respondent said to him. Those notes reveal the respondent was lying in bed sobbing and said he had ""interfered with a 13 year old girl."" The girl rang him and said she ""had had enough."" He was terrified she would tell someone and he would ""lose his kids and go to jail."" The nurse noted he was not mentally ill but acutely stressed.

8The third statement was from Dr Chris Donatsch who was the psychiatric registrar at the hospital at the relevant time. He identified hospital notes he made at the time and said they were true. Those notes begin ""Self presented to E Dept with suicidal ideation. Claims he had a sexual relationship with a 13 y.o. girl 2 months ago. Feels remorseful, terrified of consequences ..."".

9The fourth statement was from Greg Telford who was an employee of the Department of Community Services in 2007. He said that between 2 October and 10 October 2007 he was asked by the hospital to come and talk to the respondent. He went to the hospital and told the respondent:

""I know what you're here for. I have to tell you straight up that prior to talking to me, that should you mention the young girl's name, I am a mandatory reporter and I will have to notify the authorities.""

10The following exchange occurred between the witness and the respondent:

Respondent: ""Yeah that's ok"".
Witness: ""Is it true that you had sex with the young girl?""
Respondent: ""Yeah and I've got to admit I wasn't the first.""
Witness: ""Regardless she is still a minor.""
Respondent: ""I want to take responsibility for my behaviour.""

11After objection was taken to the admission of the evidence the trial judge refused to admit the evidence from these four witnesses because it would be unfair within the meaning of that term in s90 of the Evidence Act 1995. He gave as the reason for doing this that at the time the admissions were made Dr Petroff had diagnosed the respondent as mentally disordered and quoted the definition in s15 of the Mental Health Act 2007 as follows:

""A person, whether or not the person is suffering from mental illness, is a mentally disordered person if the person's behaviour for the time being, is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment or control of the person is necessary (a) for the person's own protection from serious physical harm; or (b) for the protection of others from serious physical harm.""

12The trial judge also noted that to admit the evidence might prolong any trial because of arguments as to how reliable the confessions were.

13Because this is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown must first establish that the rejection of the evidence ""...eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case."" Here the case against the respondent in the absence of the confessions was the evidence of the complainant and some evidence of complaint. The evidence of the confessions was undoubtedly the strongest part of the Crown case and the rejection of that evidence did substantially weaken the Crown case. In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWLR 228 at [37] Spigelman CJ said:

""Even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed, may still be 'substantially weakened' if evidence of cogency or force is withheld.""

14Here the Crown case in the absence of the admissions may or may not succeed and the Crown is entitled to challenge the rejection of the evidence. 

15The rejection of the evidence by the trial judge was based on s90 of the Evidence Act 1995 which allows the rejection of evidence. Section 90(b) states ""having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."" In Em v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67; [2007] HCA 46 Gummow and Hayne JJ noted that while the section requires that regard be had to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it is the use of the evidence at the trial which is to be characterised as ""unfair"": at [107].

16Although the trial judge did not refer in his reasons for rejecting the evidence to the case of R v Medcalfe [2002] ACTSC 83 it was a case submitted to the judge as relevant because of the exercise of the power to reject confession evidence under s90 based on the mental state of the accused. That was a completely different case because the accused had earlier been found unfit to plead and there was psychiatric material detailing his mental condition. It was also a case where the confession was as a result of police questioning and the judge in the ACT Supreme Court formed the view as a result of the medical evidence the accused did not understand the caution and was giving answers he thought would please.

17In this case there was no evidence of the mental state of the respondent at the time of the admissions. A bare assertion that he was mentally disordered was not sufficient to conclude it would be unfair to admit the evidence. The doctor was not called to give evidence and it is plain from the hospital notes that the only basis for concluding the respondent was mentally disordered was his concern he might go to gaol as a result of committing the offences and was threatening to commit suicide.

18The onus of establishing unfairness under s90 lies on an accused as it did at common law, see Em v The Queen supra at [63]. Here that onus was not discharged. The admissions made were apparently spontaneous and the consideration that their admission might prolong a trial because of arguments about reliability was an irrelevant consideration.

19I propose:

(1)The Crown appeal be allowed.

(2)The order rejecting the confessions be set aside.

(3)The case be remitted to the District Court at Lismore for trial.

20HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

Criminal law — Evidence — Confessions —
Admissibility — Person in authority — Accused admitting crime to undercover
police officers — Whether undercover police officers “persons in authority” —
Whether inculpatory statements properly admitted at trial without voir dire to
determine their voluntariness.

 








Criminal law — Evidence — Possible involvement of
third party in commission of offence — Accused charged with first degree murder
— Trial judge excluding evidence suggesting that victim might have been killed
by third party — Whether evidence should have been admitted — Whether
sufficient connection between third party and crime.

 

Significant circumstantial evidence linked the accused
to the murder of his aunt.  To obtain additional evidence against him, the
police began an undercover operation.  Several officers, posing as members of a
criminal organization, worked at winning the accused’s confidence.  To
encourage him to talk about the murder, they suggested that they could use
their corrupt police contacts to steer the murder investigation away from him. 
The accused eventually confessed his involvement in the murder.  At no time was
he aware of the true identities of the undercover officers.  After a jury
trial, the accused was convicted of first degree murder.  The trial judge ruled
that the accused’s inculpatory statements to the undercover officers were
admissible, holding that the undercover officers could not be persons in
authority and that no voir dire on voluntariness was necessary.  She
also ruled that evidence of the possibility that a third person might have
committed the murder should be excluded, finding that there was insufficient
evidence of a link between the third party and the murder.  A majority of the
Court of Appeal upheld the rulings and the accused’s conviction.

 

Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 








To ensure fairness and to guard against improper
coercion by the state, statements made out of court by an accused to a person
in authority are admissible only if the statements were voluntary.  The
question of voluntariness is not relevant unless there is a threshold
determination that the confession was made to a “person in authority”.  A
“person in authority” is generally someone engaged in the arrest, detention,
interrogation or prosecution of an accused.  Absent unusual circumstances, an
undercover officer is not usually viewed, from an accused’s perspective, as a
person in authority.  In this case, the accused failed to discharge the
evidentiary burden of showing that there was a valid issue for consideration,
namely, whether, when he made the confession, he believed that the person to
whom he made it was a person in authority.  The accused believed that the
undercover officers were criminals, not police officers, albeit criminals with
corrupt police contacts who could potentially influence the investigation
against him.  Where, as here, an accused confesses to an undercover officer he
thinks can influence his murder investigation by enlisting corrupt police
officers, the state’s coercive power is not engaged.  The statements,
therefore, were not made to a person in authority and a voir dire
on voluntariness was unnecessary. [34-45]

 








Evidence of the possible involvement of a third party in the commission
of an offence is admissible if it is relevant and probative.  The evidence is
relevant and probative if there is a sufficient connection between the third
party and the crime.  Here, the trial judge made no error in excluding from the
jury the theory that P might have killed the accused’s aunt.  With respect to
motive, P’s threats against the victim relating to drug dealings were not
sufficiently connected to the murder.  The threat incident took place over a
year before the murder and there was no evidence that P contacted the victim
after this incident.  In addition, the victim had stopped selling drugs eight
months before she was murdered.  The other two possible
motives relied on by the defence were based on speculation, not evidence. 
On the issue of opportunity, while P was released from remand three days before
the victim was killed, this opportunity evidence, standing alone, is an
insufficient link between P and the murder.  Similarly, absent some connection
to the murder, the evidence of P’s bad character and propensity for violence is
inadmissible. [46-61]

1                                  
Abella J. — The appellant,
Cory Grandinetti, was convicted of first degree murder following a jury trial. 
There are two issues arising out of the trial that form the basis of this
appeal.  The first is whether inculpatory statements made by the accused were
properly admitted without holding a voir dire to determine their
voluntariness.  The statements were made by the accused to undercover police
officers pretending to be members of a criminal organization.  The second is
whether evidence that a third party might have committed the murder should have
been admitted.  In my view, the trial judge did not err in connection with
either issue, and the appeal should be dismissed.

 

I.       Background

 

2                                  
Connie Grandinetti was Mr. Grandinetti’s aunt.  She was found dead in a
ditch outside Fort Saskatchewan on April 10, 1997.  She had been shot twice in
the back of her head at close range.

 

3                                  
Significant circumstantial evidence linked Cory Grandinetti to the
murder.  In July 1996, Connie Grandinetti hired a lawyer to enforce payment of
child support from her ex-husband Jeff Grandinetti, Cory Grandinetti’s uncle. 
On January 15, 1997, her lawyer applied to the court for arrears of $12,000 and
ongoing child support of $1,000 per month.  Jeff and Connie Grandinetti were
unable to reach a settlement and the child support action was adjourned until
April 18, 1997, eight days after the murder.

 








4                                  
At the end of February 1997, Jeff Grandinetti asked a friend to lend him
$10,000.  He travelled from Edmonton to Calgary to pick up the cash.

 

5                                  
Cory Grandinetti told his ex-girlfriend in March 1997 that his uncle
Jeff Grandinetti wanted Connie Grandinetti killed.  He also told her that his
uncle had obtained the money, and that he, Cory, planned to kill his aunt with
an overdose of heroin.

 

6                                  
On April 4, 1997, Cory Grandinetti travelled to Calgary.  He was
carrying two vials of heroin and a gun.  On the evening of April 9, 1997, he
borrowed his grandfather’s truck and said he was going to visit his Aunt Diane. 
Instead, he picked up Connie Grandinetti at approximately 8:00 p.m. in front of
her apartment building.  He is the last known person to see her alive.

 

7                                  
In July 1997, with few leads to investigate but suspicious that Cory
Grandinetti was involved, the RCMP began an undercover operation, Project
Kilometer, in an attempt to obtain additional evidence against him.  Several
police officers posed as members of a criminal organization and worked at
winning Cory Grandinetti’s confidence.  Mr. Grandinetti thought the criminal
enterprise he was dealing with was a large international organization involved
in drug trafficking and money laundering.  He was led to believe that this
organization was moving to Calgary, that he had been chosen as its Calgary
contact, and that he could potentially make hundreds of thousands of dollars by
participating in the organization’s criminal activities.

 








8                                  
As part of Project Kilometer, the police engaged Mr. Grandinetti in
criminal activities, including money laundering, theft, receiving illegal
firearms, and selling drugs.  A number of police officers were involved in this
operation, including Constable Keith Pearce, known to the appellant as “Mac”,
Corporal Gordon Rennick, known as “Dan”, and Constable Robert Johnston, known
as “Zeus”.  “Mac” posed as the head of the criminal organization.  At no time
was the appellant aware of the true identity of the undercover officers.

 

9                                  
From the beginning, the undercover officers encouraged Mr. Grandinetti
to talk about his aunt’s murder, but he consistently refused to do so.  By late
October, the undercover officers decided a new tactic was necessary.  They
began trying to convince the appellant that they had contacts in the police
department who were prepared to act unlawfully, and that they had been able to
use those contacts in the past to influence an investigation.  On October 30,
1997, the undercover officers convinced Mr. Grandinetti that they had managed
to have a murder charge against “Dan” reduced to aggravated assault by using
their police connections to relocate a witness and retrieve incriminating
photos.  They reinforced the perception that they had corrupt police contacts
on November 13, 1997, when “Mac” told Mr. Grandinetti that he had easily
learned the name of the investigator on the Connie Grandinetti murder
investigation.

 








10                              
To further encourage Mr. Grandinetti to talk about Connie Grandinetti’s
murder, the undercover officers suggested to him that they could use their
corrupt police contacts to steer the Connie Grandinetti murder investigation
away from him.  When he continued to balk at talking about the murder, they
told him that he might be a liability to their organization because of the
ongoing murder investigation.  They forcefully suggested he “come clean” with
them to protect the organization from possible police interference.

 

11                              
This led Mr. Grandinetti to confess his involvement in the murder,
provide details to the undercover officers, and take them to the location where
Connie Grandinetti was killed.  The confessions were recorded.  On the basis of
his confessions to the undercover officers, Mr. Grandinetti was arrested on
December 9, 1997.

 

12                              
At trial, Nash J. made two rulings that form the core of this appeal: 
first, she ruled that Mr. Grandinetti’s inculpatory statements to the
undercover officers were admissible; and second, she excluded evidence of the
possibility that a third person might have committed the murder.

 

13                              
The defence position at trial was that the undercover officers were
“persons in authority” because Mr. Grandinetti believed they could influence
the investigation into the murder of his aunt through the corrupt police
officers they claimed to know.  This, the defence argued, shifted the burden to
the Crown to prove either that Mr. Grandinetti did not reasonably believe the
undercover officers were persons in authority, or that the statements were made
voluntarily.  The Crown, on the other hand, argued that the undercover officers
could not be persons in authority because the accused must believe that the
recipient of a confession can influence the investigation or prosecution by
aiding, not thwarting, the state’s interests.

 








14                              
The trial judge held a voir dire to determine the threshold
issue, namely whether Mr. Grandinetti had met his evidentiary burden of showing
that there was a valid issue about whether the undercover officers were or
could be persons in authority.  For this purpose, the defence called three
witnesses:  Corporal Rennick, Constable Johnston, and Mr. Grandinetti.

 

15                              
The trial judge ruled that the undercover officers could not be persons
in authority, that no voir dire on voluntariness was necessary, and that
the statements were admissible.  She found that Mr. Grandinetti was totally
unaware of the true identity of the undercover officers, and, in fact, had a
collegial relationship with them.  She emphasized that the “person in
authority” test is largely a subjective one, based on the reasonable beliefs of
the accused.  She concluded that logic and reason required that the definition
of “person in authority” be limited to people the accused believes are acting
in collaboration with the authorities.  In her view, the undercover officers
could not be considered persons in authority because Mr. Grandinetti viewed
them not as acting for or in collaboration with the interests of the state, but
rather against those interests.

 

16                              
The second disputed ruling of the trial judge was her decision, after
two voir dires, to exclude defence evidence suggesting that Connie
Grandinetti may have been killed by a third party, Rick Papin.  The two voir
dires were held to assess the relevance and probative value of the
evidence.

 








17                              
During the first voir dire, the defence tendered evidence of
threats made to Connie Grandinetti by Rick Papin.  The only witness was Dustin
Grandinetti, Connie Grandinetti’s son.  He testified that his mother sold
cocaine from 1995 to 1996, but that she had stopped selling drugs by the spring
of 1996.  Ms. Grandinetti had once paid her son $100 to drive her to a location
where she sold cocaine.  Dustin Grandinetti testified that this incident was
the only personal knowledge he had of his mother’s drug dealing.  Although he
had met Rick Papin once or twice, he never saw him deliver drugs to his mother.

 

18                              
Most of Dustin Grandinetti’s testimony consisted of hearsay statements. 
He testified that Connie Grandinetti told him she had stopped using Mr. Papin
as her drug supplier, and had begun selling drugs for someone else for less
than Mr. Papin charged.  She also told him that she became afraid of Mr. Papin
in early 1996.

 

19                              
The second voir dire on this issue was much more extensive than
the first. The trial judge considered not only the testimony of those who gave
evidence on the voir dire, but also the evidence Cory Grandinetti gave
at trial.  In the presence of the jury, Mr. Grandinetti had testified that he
picked up his aunt at approximately 8:00 p.m. on April 9, 1997, and that
she was looking for cocaine.  He said they went to several bars.  Ms.
Grandinetti went inside each bar for a few minutes while her nephew waited
outside.  Mr. Grandinetti and his aunt also went to a corner store, but left
after waiting for twenty minutes.  According to Mr. Grandinetti, his aunt was
looking for someone, but did not tell him who the person was.  Later, they
drove to a house where they talked.  Ms. Grandinetti told him about the
problems she had had in the last year with Rick Papin, who was both her former
lover and former cocaine supplier.  She told Mr. Grandinetti that when the
relationship ended, so did the cocaine sales.  She said that she felt she was
not allowed to sell cocaine for anyone else.  Mr. Grandinetti’s evidence was
that he dropped Ms. Grandinetti off at a bar just after midnight.

 








20                              
Mr. Grandinetti testified on the voir dire as well.  He stated
that Connie Grandinetti told him that Rick Papin had beaten up some of her
customers, broken into her home, held a knife to her throat, and threatened to
kill her.  According to him, she had also indicated that she was gathering
information to expose Rick Papin as an informant, and that she was afraid of
Mr. Papin.

 

21                              
Lawrence Berlinguette, Connie Grandinetti’s boyfriend at the time of her
death, testified on the second voir dire that Mr. Papin, along with his
associate, Calvin Dominique, broke into their apartment on March 21, 1996.  Mr.
Dominique hit Mr. Berlinguette in the face and broke his nose.  Mr. Papin had a
hunting knife and put the blade to Connie Grandinetti’s throat, ordering her to
stay away from his customers.  Mr. Papin also told Ms. Grandinetti that he did
not want her dealing drugs in town, and slapped her in the face a few times. 
Mr. Papin and Mr. Dominique claimed that Connie Grandinetti owed them money,
and accused her of informing on them to the police.  The incident lasted
approximately ten minutes.

 

22                              
Calvin Dominique and Rick Papin were charged with several offences
arising out of this incident, but the Crown entered a stay of all proceedings
on November 26, 1996.  The day after the assault, Mr. Berlinguette and Ms.
Grandinetti moved from their apartment to the other side of the  city.

 

23                              
Mr.  Berlinguette’s evidence was that although he and Connie Grandinetti
sold cocaine for Mr. Papin from February 8, 1996 until March 21, 1996, neither
of them had any contact with Mr. Papin or Mr. Dominique after March 21, 1996. 
He also stated that Ms. Grandinetti had stopped using and selling drugs eight
months before her death.








 

24                              
Elaine McGilvery, Rick Papin’s common‑law spouse from January 1995
until February 1996, also gave evidence on the second voir dire.  She
testified that during their relationship, Mr. Papin was involved in cocaine
trafficking and Connie Grandinetti was his runner.  In late February or early
March 1996, she said, Mr. Papin believed Connie Grandinetti had ripped him off
and informed on him to the police.  She was unaware of any contact between Ms.
Grandinetti and Mr. Papin after March 21, 1996, but by that point, her
relationship with Rick Papin had ended.  Ms. McGilvery also testified that
after the break-in, Connie Grandinetti told her she was afraid of Rick Papin.

 

25                              
According to Ms. McGilvery, Mr. Papin was physically and verbally
abusive to her.  He held a knife to her throat in February 1996, and threatened
to kill her a few times in 1996.  On January 18, 1997, he choked and threatened
her while she was in a bar because he was angry at her because he had hidden a
gun at her place and wanted it back.  Ms. McGilvery testified that she had no
personal knowledge that Mr. Papin carried a gun, and that she had never seen
him with a gun.  She did, however, say that she found a gun in her residence
which she believed was placed there by Mr. Papin.  She reported the January 18
incident to the police, resulting in Mr. Papin being arrested and charged with
several offences, including assault.  As a result of the charges arising from
the January 18 assault on Ms. McGilvery, and a separate charge of threatening
Ms. McGilvery, Mr. Papin was held in custody from January 18, 1997 until April
7, 1997.

 








26                              
During the summer of 1996, Ms. McGilvery became involved with Ricky
Whitford, who was in the Remand Centre with Mr. Papin from January to April
1997.  Ricky Whitford had known Mr. Papin since 1985.  Ms. McGilvery said she
told Mr. Whitford that Mr. Papin was a police informant, and that Mr. Whitford
wanted to expose Mr. Papin.

 

27                              
Mr. Whitford’s evidence on the second voir dire was that one to
two weeks before Connie Grandinetti’s death, he told his cousin, Calvin
Dominique, that Connie Grandinetti could get information to establish that Mr. Papin
was a police informant. Mr. Whitford planned to show the documentation
establishing that Mr. Papin was an informant to everyone at the Remand Centre
in the hopes that Mr. Papin would be stabbed or beaten up.  He also said that
Ms. McGilvery told him that Ms. Grandinetti was afraid of Mr. Papin.

 

28                              
Mr. Whitford testified that although Mr. Papin used to assault people at
parties regularly, the last time he had seen him exhibit violent behaviour was
in 1993. He also said that he had seen Mr. Papin with a nine‑millimetre
handgun and a .357 Smith and Wesson.

 

29                              
Mr. Whitford’s evidence was also that Mr. Papin was angry at Ms.
McGilvery and blamed her for his incarceration.

 

30                              
Terry Garnett, the deputy director of security for the Edmonton Remand
Centre, testified on the voir dire that Rick Papin was detained from
January 18, 1997 to April 7, 1997 at the Remand Centre.  According to him, the
records showed that neither Mr. Dominique, Ms. McGilvery, nor Ms. Grandinetti
visited Mr. Papin while he was in custody.

 








31                              
Constable Dennis Hartl, who also gave evidence on this voir dire,
arrested Connie Grandinetti on January 7, 1997 on a charge of selling cocaine
to an undercover police officer on March 1, 1996.  She was never formally
charged.  The sale was made on behalf of Rick Papin.  After her arrest, Ms.
Grandinetti provided information about a number of drug dealers, but she did
not provide any information about Mr. Papin.  She also told Constable Hartl
that she was not afraid of Mr. Papin and was willing to testify against him on
the break-and-enter charge arising from his 1996 assault in her apartment.

 

32                              
The trial judge, after conducting the two voir dires, ruled that
there was insufficient evidence of a link between Rick Papin and the murder of
Connie Grandinetti, and excluded the evidence.

 

33                              
The jury found Cory Grandinetti guilty of the murder of his aunt.  Mr.
Grandinetti appealed his conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal ((2003), 339
A.R. 52).  The majority (McFadyen and Côté JJ.A.) upheld the rulings and
dismissed the appeal.  Conrad J.A. dissented, holding that it was possible to
conclude that the undercover police officers were persons in authority,
therefore necessitating a voluntariness voir dire, and that there was a
sufficient link between Rick Papin and Connie Grandinetti’s murder to make the
evidence admissible.  The basis of this appeal is a challenge to the rulings of
the trial judge admitting the confessions and excluding the evidence that Rick
Papin might have committed the murder.

 

II.      Analysis

 

A.     The Admissibility of the Inculpatory
Statements








 

34                              
The confessions rule ensures that statements made out of court by an
accused to a person in authority are admissible only if the statements were
voluntary. The relevant principles were canvassed by this Court in R. v.
Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, and R. v. Oickle, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3,
2000 SCC 38.  In Oickle, at paras. 47-71, the Court set out the factors
relevant to the voluntariness inquiry.  The issue argued on this appeal by the
appellant was whether the impugned statements were made to a “person in
authority” within the meaning of Hodgson, and not whether they were free
and voluntary within the meaning of Oickle.

 

35                              
The rule, the policies supporting it, and the definition of “person in
authority”, were all considered in Hodgson.  Cory J. expressed the
rule’s rationale as follows:

 

The rule is based upon two fundamentally important
concepts: the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to
ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.

 

. . .

 

It cannot be forgotten that it is the nature of the authority exerted
by the state that might prompt an involuntary statement. . . . In
other words, it is the fear of reprisal or hope of leniency that persons in
authority may hold out and which is associated with their official status that
may render a statement involuntary. . . .  This limitation
[i.e., the person in authority requirement] is appropriate since most criminal
investigations are undertaken by the state, and it is then that an accused is
most vulnerable to state coercion. [paras. 48 and 24]

 








The underlying
rationale of the “person in authority” analysis is to avoid the unfairness and
unreliability of admitting statements made when the accused believes himself or
herself to be under pressure from the uniquely coercive power of the state.  In
Hodgson, although explicitly invited to do so, the Court refused to
eliminate the requirement for a “person in authority” threshold determination. 
As Cory J. stated, were it not for this requisite inquiry,

 

all statements to undercover police officers would become subject to
the confessions rule, even though the accused was completely unaware of their
status and, at the time he made the statement, would never have considered the
undercover officers to be persons in authority. [para. 25]

 

36                              
There is no doubt, as the Court observed in Hodgson, at para. 26,
that statements can sometimes be made in such coercive circumstances that their
reliability is jeopardized even if they were not made to a person in
authority.  The admissibility of such statements is filtered through
exclusionary doctrines like abuse of process at common law and under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to prevent the admission of statements that
undermine the integrity of the judicial process.  The “abuse of process”
argument was, in fact, made by Mr. Grandinetti at trial, but was rejected both
at trial and on appeal, and was not argued before us.

 

37                              
In Hodgson, the Court delineated the process for assessing
whether a confession should be admitted.  First, there is an evidentiary burden
on the accused to show that there is a valid issue for consideration about
whether, when the accused made the confession, he or she believed that the
person to whom it was made was a person in authority.  A “person in authority”
is generally someone engaged in the arrest, detention, interrogation or
prosecution of the accused.  The burden then shifts to the Crown to prove,
beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the accused did not reasonably believe
that the person to whom the confession was made was a person in authority, or,
if he or she did so believe, that the statement was made voluntarily.  The
question of voluntariness is not relevant unless the threshold determination
has been made that the confession was made to a “person in authority”.








 

38                              
The test of who is a “person in authority” is largely subjective,
focusing on the accused’s perception of the person to whom he or she is making
the statement.  The operative question is whether the accused, based on his or
her perception of the recipient’s ability to influence the prosecution,
believed either that refusing to make a statement to the person would result in
prejudice, or that making one would result in favourable treatment.

 

39                              
There is also an objective element, namely, the reasonableness of the
accused’s belief that he or she is speaking to a person in authority.  It is
not enough, however, that an accused reasonably believe that a person can
influence the course of the investigation or prosecution.  As the trial judge
correctly concluded:

 

[R]eason and common sense dictates that when the cases speak of a
person in authority as one who is capable of controlling or influencing the
course of the proceedings, it is from the perspective of someone who is
involved in the investigation, the apprehension and prosecution of a criminal
offence resulting in a conviction, an agent of the police or someone working in
collaboration with the police.  It does not include someone who seeks to
sabotage the investigation or steer the investigation away from a suspect that
the state is investigating. 

 

(Alta. Q.B., No. 98032644C5, April 30 1999, at para. 56)

 

40                              
Although the person in authority test is not a categorical one, absent
unusual circumstances an undercover officer will not be a person in authority
since, from the accused’s viewpoint, he or she will not usually be so viewed. 
This position is supported by precedent.  As Cory J. explained in Hodgson:

 








The receiver’s status as a person in authority
arises only if the accused had knowledge of that status.  If the accused cannot
show that he or she had knowledge of the receiver’s status (as, for example, in
the case of an undercover police officer) . . ., the inquiry
pertaining to the receiver as a person in authority must end. [para. 39]

 

See also Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 664; R. v. Todd (1901), 4
C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.), at p. 527.

 

41                              
The appellant conceded that undercover officers are usually not persons
in authority.  His position is that although undercover officers are not
usually persons in authority, when an undercover operation includes as part of
its ruse a suggested association with corrupt police, who the accused is told
could influence the investigation and prosecution of the offence, the officers
qualify as persons in authority.

 

42                              
However, under the traditional confession rule,

 

a person in authority is a person concerned with the prosecution who,
in the opinion of the accused, can influence the course of the prosecution.

 

(R. v. Berger (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 357 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 385,
cited in Hodgson, at para. 33)

 

43                              
This, it seems to me, is further elaborated in Hodgson by Cory J._s description of a person in
authority as someone whom the confessor perceives to be “an agent of the police
or prosecuting authorities”, “allied with the state authorities”, “acting on
behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities”, and “acting in concert with
the police or prosecutorial authorities, or as their agent” (paras. 34-36 and
47).  He amplified this theory as follows:

 








Since the person in authority requirement is aimed at controlling
coercive state conduct, the test for a person in authority should not include
those whom the accused unreasonably believes to be acting on behalf of the
state. Thus, where the accused speaks out of fear of reprisal or hope of
advantage because he reasonably believes the person receiving the statement is
acting as an agent of the police or prosecuting authorities and could therefore
influence or control the proceedings against him or her, then the receiver of the
statement is properly considered a person in authority. In other words, the
evidence must disclose not only that the accused subjectively believed the
receiver of the statement to be in a position to control the proceedings
against the accused, but must also establish an objectively reasonable basis
for that belief. . . .

 

. . .

 

. . . there is no catalogue of persons, beyond a peace
officer or prison guard, who are automatically considered a person in authority
solely by virtue of their status.  A parent, doctor, teacher or employer all
may be found to be a person in authority if the circumstances warrant, but
their status, or the mere fact that they may wield some personal authority over
the accused, is not sufficient to establish them as persons in authority for
the purposes of the confessions rule. . . . [T]he person in
authority requirement has evolved in a manner that avoids a formalistic or
legalistic approach to the interactions between ordinary citizens. Instead, it
requires a case‑by‑case consideration of the accused’s belief as to
the ability of the receiver of the statement to influence the prosecution or
investigation of the crime. That is to say, the trial judge must determine
whether the accused reasonably believed the receiver of the statement was
acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities. [paras. 34 and 36]

 

44                              
The appellant believed that the undercover officers were criminals, not
police officers, albeit criminals with corrupt police contacts who could
potentially influence the investigation against him.  When, as in this case,
the accused confesses to an undercover officer he thinks can influence his
murder investigation by enlisting corrupt police officers, the state’s coercive
power is not engaged.  The statements, therefore, were not made to a person in
authority.

 

45                              
The accused having failed to discharge the evidentiary burden of showing
that there was a valid issue for consideration, a voir dire on
voluntariness became unnecessary.








 

B.      The Evidence of Possible Third Party
Involvement

 

46                              
Evidence of the potential involvement of a third party in the commission
of an offence is admissible.  In R. v. McMillan (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 750
(C.A.), aff’d  [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, Martin J.A. stated the simple underlying
premise to be:

 

[I]t [is] self‑evident that if A is charged with the murder of X,
then A is entitled, by way of defence, to adduce evidence to prove that B, not
A, murdered X. [p. 757]

 

However, as he
explained, the evidence must be relevant and probative:

 

Evidence directed to prove that the crime was committed by a third
person, rather than the accused, must, of course, meet the test of relevancy
and must have sufficient probative value to justify its reception. 
Consequently, the Courts have shown a disinclination to admit such evidence
unless the third person is sufficiently connected by other circumstances with
the crime charged to give the proffered evidence some probative value. [p. 757]

 

47                              
The requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the third
party and the crime is essential.  Without this link, the third party evidence
is neither relevant nor probative.  The evidence may be inferential, but the
inferences must be reasonable, based on the evidence, and not amount to
speculation.

 








48                              
The defence must show that there is some basis upon which a reasonable,
properly instructed jury could acquit based on the defence:  R. v. Fontaine,
[2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, 2004 SCC 27, at para. 70.  If there is an insufficient
connection, the defence of third party involvement will lack the requisite air
of reality:   R. v. Cinous, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, 2002 SCC 29.

 

49                              
The trial judge correctly formulated the legal test for admitting third
party evidence:

 

The cases establish that an accused may adduce
evidence tending to show that a third person committed the offence.  The
disposition of a third person to commit the offence is probative and admissible
provided that there is other evidence tending to connect the third person with
the commission of the offence. 

 

(Ruling (voir dire), Appellant’s Record, at p. 64)

 

The remaining
question, therefore, is whether she correctly applied the test to the facts in
holding that there was an insufficient connection between Rick Papin and the
murder of Connie Grandinetti for the jury to hear the evidence.

 

50                              
The appellant argued that there was evidence tending to show that Rick
Papin had motive, opportunity and the propensity to murder Connie Grandinetti.

 








51                              
With respect to motive, the appellant relied first on the March 21, 1996
threat incident.  There is no doubt that threats can, under some circumstances,
provide evidence of motive or disposition.  But, there must be a sufficient
connection between the threats and the crime before evidence of the threats is
admissible.  In this case, I agree with the trial judge that there is not a
sufficient connection between the March 21, 1996 threat incident  and the April
10, 1997 murder.  The threats were made when Mr. Papin believed that Connie
Grandinetti was selling cocaine from another supplier to his customers. 
However, Mr. Berlinguette gave uncontradicted evidence that Ms. Grandinetti had
stopped selling drugs eight months prior to her murder.  Since the evidence
showed that Ms. Grandinetti was no longer selling drugs to Mr. Papin’s
customers, that motive was extinguished.

 

52                              
Moreover, the threat incident occurred more than a year before the
murder, and, according to Mr. Berlinguette, Ms. Grandinetti never saw Mr. Papin
again.  There was, in fact, no evidence that there was any contact between Rick
Papin and Connie Grandinetti after March 21, 1996.

 

53                              
The appellant also argued that Mr. Papin might have known that Connie
Grandinetti was a police informant and might have feared that she would inform
on him.  According to the appellant, Mr. Papin could have learned that Connie
Grandinetti was a police informant in one of two ways: either from the police
themselves, since Mr. Papin was also an informant, or from the fact that Mr.
Papin was also part of the investigation that led to Connie Grandinetti’s 1997
arrest for selling drugs in 1996.

 








54                              
I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s conclusion that
there was insufficient evidence reasonably to infer that Mr. Papin’s motive for
killing Ms. Grandinetti was either to punish her for, or prevent her from,
informing on him.  Constable Hartl, the officer who arrested Connie Grandinetti
in January 1997 for selling drugs the previous March, never suggested in his
evidence that anyone was told about Ms. Grandinetti’s decision to become a
police informant.  He also testified that despite becoming an informant, Connie
Grandinetti never informed on Rick Papin.  It is nothing more than speculation
to suggest that the police betrayed Ms. Grandinetti by telling Mr. Papin that
she was a confidential informant.  Further, there was uncontradicted evidence
that Mr. Papin blamed Ms. McGilvery, not Ms. Grandinetti, for his incarceration
in early 1997.

 

55                              
There was, moreover, no evidence that Rick Papin knew of Connie
Grandinetti’s January 7, 1997 arrest.  Although the appellant speculated that
Mr. Papin might have been subject to arrest or interrogation as part of the
same investigation that led to Ms. Grandinetti’s arrest, there was no evidence
that that ever happened.

 

56                              
The appellant argued in the alternative that Mr. Papin might have
learned from Mr. Dominique that Connie Grandinetti was planning to provide
information to Mr. Whitford exposing Mr. Papin as an informant.  According to
Mr. Whitford’s evidence, he told Mr. Dominique about Connie Grandinetti’s
involvement in his plan.  According to the appellant’s submissions, this could
lead to the inference that Mr. Dominique told Mr. Papin about it, especially since
the two men had been close associates.  According to the prison records, Mr.
Dominique never visited Mr. Papin while he was incarcerated.  There is no
evidence as to whether the two ever spoke on the phone.

 

57                              
Mr. Dominique did not testify.  Without his testimony, no direct
evidence supports the theory advanced by the appellant.  None of the evidence
indicated that there was even any contact between Mr. Dominique and Mr. Papin
while Mr. Papin was incarcerated at the Remand Centre in the months before Connie
Grandinetti’s death.  There was also some evidence that Mr. Papin and Mr.
Dominique had a falling out, namely the fact that Mr. Whitford was discussing
exposing Mr. Papin’s informant status with Mr. Dominique, something he was
unlikely to do if Mr. Dominique was still Mr. Papin’s “right-hand man”.








 

58                              
The arguments amount to a chain of speculation joined by gossamer links.
There was simply not enough evidence that Mr. Papin had a motive for killing
Connie Grandinetti.

 

59                              
The opportunity evidence relied on by the appellant was that Mr. Papin
was released from prison three days before Connie Grandinetti was killed. 
Standing alone, this evidence is palpably unprobative.  As the trial judge
found:

 

There is no evidence that Rick Papin had the
opportunity to commit the murder.  There is no evidence that he had access to
or contact with Connie Grandinetti when she was killed.  Although the evidence
establishes that he was not in custody, that fact alone, in my view, is not
evidence of opportunity as that factor has been considered by the courts.

 

(Ruling (voir dire), Appellant’s Record, at p. 71)

 

The fact that
Mr. Papin was released from the Remand Centre on April 7, 1997 is an
insufficient link between him and the murder on April 10, 1997.

 

60                              
The appellant argues additionally that there is ample evidence of Rick
Papin’s bad character and propensity for violence.  I agree.  There was
evidence that Rick Papin owned a gun, threatened his spouse verbally and
physically, and had previously been jailed for assault.  All of this evidence,
however, is inadmissible in the absence of evidence connecting Mr. Papin and
the murder.

 








61                              
I am therefore of the view that the trial judge made no error in excluding
from the jury the theory that Rick Papin might have killed Ms. Grandinetti. 
The threat incident, which took place over a year before the murder, was not
sufficiently connected to the murder.  The two other possible motives were
based on speculation, not evidence. The opportunity evidence was insufficient,
and the propensity evidence was, standing alone, deficient because it lacked a
sufficient link to the murder.

 

62                              
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

Appeal dismissed.

REASONS FOR  DECISION 

! 

The  appellant Mrs. Meth sued  on her own  behalf and  on behalf of 

her youngest  chzld  to  recover dmages  as a  result of the  death of her 
husband who was  kllled m  a motor vehcle accident on 8 September 1972. 
Her c l a m  was hsmlssed.
--------
She  sued  three  defendants. 

The  flrst,  Graham  Sulllvan,  was 

jomed on  the  basls  that  he  was  t h e  drlver  of  the  motor  vehlcle  m 
w h c h  the  deceased  was  a passenger  when  A t  rolled  over on the  road 
from  Tennant  Creek t o   t h e   Warrego  m e .   The  learned  trlal 
lead- 

Judge  held  that  there  was  no  evldence  t h a t   Sh~lllvan was  the  drlver 
at the  relevant  tune;  there  was  no appeal  from  that  p a r t   of  the  judgnent. 

Robert  Shaun Hoore,  the  second  defendant  and  now  the  flrst 
respondent,  was  sued  as  the  owner of  t h e  motor  v e h c l e .   The case 
agmst h m  was  that  he  was  g u l l t y  of  neglzgence m  allowmg  the  vehxle 
t o  be driven when  he  h e w  or ought  t o  have  known  t h a t   it was  m  an unsafe 

c o n b t l o n  and  m  f a l u g  t o  w a r n   t h e   flrst defendant  or the  deceased 
t h a t   it was  m  an  unsafe  conktlon. 
reference  to  the  first  defendant  IS no  longer relevant.  There was 

For reasons  just  mentioned,  the 

vehcle was  bemg  drzven 
evldence  that  at the  tune  of  the  accldent  the 
by a man  hown  only  by h s  flrst name  and  who  later  hsappeared.  He 
. was  not  jomed  as  a  defendant. 
The  nommal  defendant 

(now  the  second  respondent)  was  jomed 

as t h r d  defendant,  on  the  basls  that  although  a pollcy  of  msurance 

complymg  wlth  the  provulons  of  the  Motor  Vehlcles  Insurance  Act  of 

Queensland  was  current  m  r e g a d   t o   the  v e h c l e  at  the  tune  of  the 
accldent,  the  vehlcle  was,  m  terns  of  the Motor  Vehlcles  Act  of  t h e  
On that  basls  and  pursuant  to  s.82 of 

Northern  Territory,  -sured. 

the Act  (now  repealed)  the nommal  defendant  was  sued  m  the  alternatlve. 

After  the  hearmg  of  the  appeal  had  begun  the  Court  was  t o l d  by 

two  respondents  that  no  b s t i n c t l o n  was  made  m  regard 
counsel  for  the 
t o   t h e u   p o s l t l o n s  and  that  lf the  appeal  were  allowed  there  should  ‘be 
judgment  agamst  the nommal  defendant  only.  The  appellant  agreed  wlth 

t h s  approach.

The  lssues m  the  appeal  may  be  stated  qulte  shortly. 
Did the  owner  of  the 
motor  v e h c l e   OWP  t o   the  deceased

t o   ensure  that  the  vehlcle  was  m  a 

safe  condltlon

If  so,  h d  he  breach  that  duty? 
!Che  vehlcle  m  question was  a n  FC  Holden  ssdan  of the  1958-1959

IClugston  hmself  had only 
oomed  the  vehlcle  about  a week.  He  p a d  $130 o r  $180,  he  was  not  sure

It was  a  s t r a g h t   s t r e t c h   of  road,  the  weather  was  f m e ,   and 

the car w a s   t r a v e l l u g   a t   about  45  rmles  an  hour  at the  tune. 
Elaboratmg  hls  descrlptlon  of  w h a t   happened,  Mr.  Kmgston s a d  t h a t

back  of  t h e   c a r   m e b a t e l y   r e a r e d   up  and  that  the  car  rolled  over. 

Evidence  was  glven  by  Duncan  Townsley,  a  plant 

 mspector 

and 

motor mechanic,  regardmg  the  conbtlon  of  the  vehlcle  and  the  llkely 

cause  of  the  accldent. 

H m  Honour's  conclusion  was  m  these  terms. 

V h e  reasonable  lnference  1 s   that  the  accldent  was 
caused  by  the  t a l  shaft  becommg  deteched  at  the 
forward  end,  spearmg  m t o  the  ground and causmg

21 1, 

The learned trlal  Judge  held  that  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by 

the  owner  of  a motor  vehlcle  to  a g r a h t o u s  passenger  1 s   one  only  to 

w a r n   the  passenger  of  a  defect  m  the  vehlcle  h o w n   t o   t h e   e l v e r   b u t  

concealed  from the  passenger. 

As there was  no evldence  that  the  owner 

knew  o f   t h e   d e f e c t l v e   c o n b t l o n   o f   t h e   m v e r s a l   j o m t   w h u h  

caused 

t h e  tal shaft  to  become  detached  from  the  gearbox  at  Its forward  end, 
h l s  Honour & s u s s e d   the  appellantss  cl-.  He 

reached  that  vlew  of 

*he  duty  of  care  after 

a  conslderatlon  of  varlous  authorltles  whch 

It 

1s necessary  for  thls  Court  to  renew. 

HIS Honour  went  on  t o   h o l d   t h a t  

there was  no  sufflclent  evulence  to  w a r r a n t   a  concluslon  that  the  owner 
ought  t o  have  h o w n   of  the  defect,  a  concluslon whlch  does not  appear 

t o  have  been  necessary  havmg  regard to  the  prmclple  he  thought 

applicable  and  a  concluslon  whch  he  &d  not  elaborate. 

In my opmlon  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  owner  of  a motor 

v e h c l e   t o   a passenger  1s not  that  propounded  by  h s  Honour. 

A  conslderatlon  of  the  relevant  authorltles  usually  begms  wlth 
h c t a  of  Goddard L.J.  m Haseldme v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son  Ltd.  (1941)  2  K.B. 
343  at p.373: 

""If  A  agrees  to  drive  B  t o  the  s t a t l o n  m h s  car

But,  If  B  stops A  m  t h e   s t r e e t   and  asks  f o r  a

Goddard  L.J.  commented  t h a t   t h e

But,  with  respect  to  h m  Lordshlp,  that  earller  declslon  of  the  Privy 
Councll  was  e x p l m e d  by  Jacobs  J.A.  u Wanless  v.  P i e n u g  (1976)  SR 

(NSW)  249  at pp.256-257  as  no  such  authority. 

As  Jacobs  J.A.  pouted  out,  the  test  applled  by  the Privy  Councll 
was  whether  there was  any  endence  that  the  carnage  had  not  been  properly 

m a m t m e d   and  held  that  there  was  no  such  evidence. 

""he  p o m t   was 

slmply  whether  there  had  been  a  case  to  go t o   t h e   j u r y   and,  there  bemg 

evldence  t h a t   t h e   c a r n a g e   was  regularly exammed  by  a blacksrmth  every 
three months,  It was  not negllgerce  for  the  owner  t o   f a d  t o  examme  the 
state of  Its bolts  and  f a s t e m g s   b e f o r e   go-  for a  drlve.  There  1s 

mentlon  of  the  need 

t o  establish  ""neghgence  of  a gross descrlptlon"". 

In  the  words  of  Jacobs  J.A. 

""Such  a  p r u c l p l e  1s not  the  law  (see  Insurance 
Comrmssloner v.  Josce  (1948)  77  C . L . R m  
t h a t   does  not  affect  the  pout  of  present  debate"". 

I respectfully  adopt  that  analysls  of  Moffatt 

v.  Bateman  and  agree 

that  no  p r m c l p l e   can  be  drawn  from  It  that  the  owner  of  a v e h c l e  owes 

no  general  duty  of  care  to  a gratutous  passenger,  so  far as  concerns  t h e  

conbtlon  of  the  vekcle.

h l s  Honour's  remarks  may  have  been 

no  more  than  oblter  for 

he 

went  on  to  conslder  the  obhgatlon  of  a person  who  a c q u r e s  a  secondhand 

vehlcle,  notmg  that  m  the  lnstant  case  there  was  no  evldence  before 

the  jury  of

or of its use; 

nor was  there  any  evidence  from  whlch

Wanless v.  Plenlng  concerned  a  c l a m  by  a  gratuitous  passenger  m 
and overturned, serzously mjurmg b. He 

a  car whlch  ran off  the  road 
sued  the  defendant  (owner  anC b n v e r )   for damages, a l l e p g  neghgence 

i n  the  care,  control,  mamtenance 

and management  of  the  vehlcle. 

He relied 

pr-lly 

upon  a  f a l u r e  of  the  brakes.  The  judgments  were  m a y  
of the  doctrme  of r e s   I p s a   l o q u t u r .  

concerned  wlth  the  appllcatlon 

In  the  course  of  hls 

judgment  Jacobs  J.A.  mentioned  t h e   h c t a   m 

Dolbel v.  Dolbel  and Hweldme  v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son  Ltd.,  referred  to 
m  these  reasons.  HIS  Honour  commented 
law  r e l a t m g   t o   occupier's  l l a b l l l t y  was  appllcable  m  the  case  of  mjurles 

that  there  was  no  doubt  that  the

""There  1 s   then no  dlfference between  the  llcensee 
who  enters  a  home  and  the  llcensee  who  enters  a 
motor  vehicle""  (at p.256). 

But,  h s  Honour pouted  out,  the  act  of 

a person  drivmg a vehlcle  that 

has  not  been  properly  mamtamed  cannot  be  equated  with  the  llablllty

Holmes J.A.  concurred  w L t h   Jacobs  J.A. 

Asprey  J.A. 

took  a dLfferent  new. 

He accepted  what  was  s a d  by 

Goddard  L.J.  m Haseldlne  v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son Ltd.  as  approved  111 

v.  Bateman 
Dolbel  v.  Dolbel,  noting  that  both  cases  treated  Moffatt 
as authorlty  for  the  proposltlon  that  m  the  case  of  a gratuitous 

passenger  the  duty  of  the  drlver 

or owner  1 s   confined  t o  w w g  of  a 

known  defect. 

Wdess v.  Plenmg was  reversed  on  appeal  (Plenmg  v.  Wvlless 

(1967-1968)  11  C.L.R.  @8),  but  on  grounds  not  relevant  to  the  present 
pmceedlngJ.  However,  m  the  course  of 

hls judgment,  Wlndeyer  J. 

referred  to  the  remarks  of  Jacobs 

J.A.  already mentioned  and commented 

that  although  the  matter  was  not  free  fmm  dzfflculty,  ""because  not  free 
from  author;Ltles,""  he  ""would  be  lnclmed  to  thlnk  that  a g r a h t o u s  

passenger  could  be  s m p l y  a  fnelghbourl as  Jacobs  J.A.  apparently  thought"" 

(at p.512).  Windeyer  J.  added. 

""I do not  doubt  t h a t   the man who  drlves  a motor 
vehmle  when  he  knows  t h a t   It  1s not  roadworthy 
found  ..., and almost  c e r t m l y  would  be  found, 
and 1s  ldcely  to  get  out  o f   control,  could  be

anyone  to  take  It upon  the  road"". 
(at p.512). 
In my  vzew  there  1s no  authorlty  blndrng  upon  thls  Court  that 

holds  the  duty  of  the  owner  of  a motor  vehlcle  m motlon  t o  be  confmed

W l e  It may  be  loglcal,  if somewhat  unreal,  to  equate  a 

stationary motor  vehlcle with  a house  or  other  structure,  It  IS not 
IS  m motlon.  If 

l o g ~ c a l   t o  contmue  the  equatlon  once  the  vehrcle 

the  duty  owed  by the  owner  of  a  s t a t l c   v e h c l e   t o  a passenger  1s 

comparable  t o   t h a t   of  the  occupler  of  prermses,  there 

is no  reason 

m  law  or loglc why  a  different  and  broader  duty  should  not  arzse 
m  respect  of  a movlng vehlcle,  the  same  duty as IS  owed  t o   o t h e r  
users of  the  road.  For  mstance, 

(1980)  2  W.L.R. 

Lambert  v .

was  an  actlon under the  Engllsh  Fatal  Accldents  Act  where  p a r t   of  a 

towmg h t c h  became  detached,  causmg  a  t r a l e r  to  career  across  the 

road  into  the  path 

of  a  car.  The p l m t l f f  sued  the  owner  of  the  vehlcle, 

t h e  owner's  employee  and  drlver,  the  manufacturer  of  the  towmg  hztch, 

and  t h e   r e t a l e r  who  supplxed  and  f l t t e d  A t .  

It was  smply  taken  f o r

t h e  owner was  concerned,  was  whether  he  had 

f a l e d  t o   t a k e   that  care. 

In  an  analagous  way  the  duty  owed  by  an  occupler,  f o r  mstance 

a bullder of  prermses  m  the  course  of  construction,  is not  the  same  duty 

owed  in  respect  of  actlvltzes  bemg  carrled  out  on  the  premises,  f o r

W A R .   97. 

In my  opmlon  tlvs  Court  should  approach  the  matter  before  it on 

the  basls  that  the  f u s t  respondent,  as  owner  of  the motor  velvcle  lnvolved 

in  the  accident,  owed  a  duty  of  care 
steps  to  see  that  the  vehicle  was  m  a  safe  c o n b t l o n   t o   be  driven.

c a r r x d  a  current  Queensland  r e g u t r a t i o n .   The  endence of  Mr.  Townsley 
was  that  a  competent  service  of  the  vehlcle  would  have  lncluded 
lnspectlng  the  m v e r s a l   j o l n t s   and  t h a t   a  competent  inspection would 

h v e  revealed wear  m.  both m v e r s a l  Jolnts at  the  end  of  the  tal shaft. 

But  it was  not  suggested  that  any  defect  m  t h e  tal shaft would  have 
been  apparent  without  such a n  mspection. 
that  anyone  drlvmg  the  vehacle  would  have  become  aware  of such a  defect. 

i n  p a d l c u l a r   t h e r e   was no  evulence 

For the  appellant  to  succeed  ln e s t a b l l s h u g  negligence  on  the 

part  of  the  owner  of  the  motor  vehacle 

lt is necessary,  m  the  cmxmstances, 

f o r  h e r   t o   e s t a b l l s h   t h a t   at the  time  o f   purchase  the  vehcle  was  ln such 

an  obvlously bad  s t a t e  of  general  repalr  that  no  owner, exercislng 
reasonzble  care,  would  have  allowed  A t   t o  be  drlven untll  It had  undergone 
a  competent  lnspectlon  and  s e m c e .  

Mr.  Townsley's  report  of  11  September  shows  that  the  right  hand 

tyre  had  5%  wear,  the  r;l@  hand  rear  tyre  was  b a l d ,   t h e   l e f t   hand  f r o n t

""The  general  appearance  of  the  vehlcle  shows  neglect 
m  a l l  ways,  mechaucal  faults  found  could  have  been 
the  cause  of  the  actual  accldent"". 

A  mechazucal  f a u l t   was  held  t o  be  the  cause  of  the  accldent. 

Mr.  Moore  b d  not  e v e  evu3ence.  Mr.  Kmgston  was  asked  no 
questlons  about  the  conbtlon  o f   t h e   c a r ,   a t h e r   as  t o  the  tune  he 

owned  It or thereafter.  A  month  o r  so  after  the  accldent  he  took 
photographs  of  the  damaged  vehlcle  whlle  It was  m  the  pollce  yard  and 
those  photographs  were  tendered  m  evldence.  But  no  particular  use 
appears  t o  have  been  made  of  them  m  the  Supreme  Court  and  no p a r t ~ ~ l a r  
use  was  made  of  them  m  t h i s   Court. 

Both  m  exarmnation  m  d u e f   and  m  cross-ex-atlon  Mr.  Townsley 

of  t h e   v e h c l e   as 

w a s   asked  a  number of  questlons  abom  the  conhtlon 
observed by  him.  Much  of  that  evldence  related  to  the  conbtlon 
of  the 
drive  shaft,  wlth  a  descrzptlon  of  the  w a y  m  whxh  A t   IS  llnked t o  the 
gear  box  and t o  t h e   b f f e r e n t l a l ,   m  each  case  rnth  a unlversal  Jolnt. 
W. Townsley  spoke  of the need t o   grease  each  unlversal  j o m t ;   If t h s  1s 
not  done  lt 1 s   l l k e l y   t h a t   one  of  the  uuversal  j o m t s  wz11  glve way 
causmg  an end of the  tal shaft  t o   fall t o   t h e   ground.  As already 

trial  Judge held  that  thu was  the  cause  of tne 
mentioned,  the  learned 
accldent  and as  that  findug was  not  challenged,  It  1s unnecessary  t o  
spend  more tune  on t h s  aspect  of  the  car's  conbtlon.  Mr.  Townsley  b d  
say that  a  c o q e t e n t   s e r n c e   would  mclude  a  check  of the  mversal  j o l n t s ,  
and,  m  the  case  of  thuj v e h c l e ,   would  have  shown  them 
h s  o p m o n   t h e   v e h c l e   had  probably  travelled  2,500  mles  or  thereabouts 

t o  be worn.

before  the  accldent

Even in  the  case  of  the

But  I understand hls 

lllcely  source  of  concern. 

In my  n e w  the  evldence  led  m  the  Supreme  Court  on behalf  of  the

tended  to  focus  on  the  lack  of  adequate  mmtenance  of  the  vehlcle  over  a 

tune  and  on  the  defects  that  would  have  been  apparent  had  the  vehicle  been 

servlced o r  mspected  by  a  competent  mechanic.  A  person  who  buys  a motor

v e h c l e  i s  not  negligent  merely  because  he 

fails t o  have  t h e   v e h c l e  

serviced or l n s p e c t e d   m e d i a t e l y   a f t e r   or w i t h m  a  few  days  of  purchase. 
But  i f   there  1s somethlng m  the  appearance  of  the  vehicle 
or the  way  m 
whch  It z s   drlvug that  would  a l e r t  a  reasonably  careful  dr;zver  t o   t h e

t o  allow  the  car  on  the  road  without  a 

f o r  h m   t o  fa1 t o  

take  such  a  step. 

In  the  present  case  there  was  no  evidence  of  anythmg abnormal 

m  t h e  way  m  whlch  the  car  drove;  but 

i f   there was  somethmg  m  zts 

general  appearance 

t o   a l e r t   a  reasonably  careful  driver  to  a  posszble 

defect,  the  first respondent  may  have  been  negligent  m  allowlng  the  vehcle 

on  t h e  road. 

Although  the  learned  trial  Judge  held  there  was  msufficzent 

evidence  that  the  flrst  respondent  ought 

t o  have  lmown  of  the  defective 

c o n b t l o n   o f   t h e   u u v e r s a l   j o m t ,  

it was  a  conclusion  related  to  a  flndrng

the  nature  of  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  first respondent  to  the 

deceased,  such  a  frndrng was  not  conclusive  agaulst  the  appellant. 

A g a m  it was  clearly  coloured  by  hls  Honour's  view  of  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  owner  of  a motor  v e h x l e   t o  a  gratuitous  passenger,  a  vzew 

which  ln my respectful  opuuon was  m  error. 

I have  given  careful  consuleration  to  whether 

t h s  Court  i s  m

adduced  before 

to  reach  zts own  conclusion.  I am  of  the  opmon

t h a t  it is not  ln such a position  and  ought  n o t   t o   do  so.  There  a r e  I 

thmk  flndlngs  of  f a c t   t h a t   need  t o  be  made  ln the  light  of  the

on appeal from the court
of appeal for nova scotia

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Sexual assault — Consent — Complainant consenting to sexual
activity with male partner unaware that he had sabotaged condom — Whether
evidence establishing that there was no voluntary agreement of the complainant
to engage in the sexual activity in question or whether complainant’s apparent
consent was vitiated by fraud — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
ss. 265(3) (c), 273.1(1) .

                    The
complainant agreed to sexual activity with her partner, H, insisting that he
use a condom in order to prevent conception.  Unknown to her, H had poked holes
in the condom and the complainant became pregnant.  H was charged with
aggravated sexual assault.  The trial judge found that the complainant had not
consented to unprotected sex and convicted H of sexual assault.  On appeal, the
majority upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection was an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant did
not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  The dissenting judge held
that there was consent to the “sexual activity in question”, but that a new
trial was required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud.

                    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell and Wagner JJ.:  The
Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to
sexual activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence
establishes that there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  and it requires
proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the touching, its
sexual nature, or the identity of the partner. If the complainant consented, or
her conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of voluntary agreement to
the sexual activity in question, the second step is to consider under ss. 265(3) 
and 273.1(2)  whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate the
complainant’s ostensible consent or participation.  In this case, the main
issue is whether condom sabotage resulted in there being no “voluntary
agreement by the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question”
under s. 273.1(1)  or whether the condom sabotage constituted fraud
under s. 265(3) (c), with the result that no consent was obtained. Resolving
this issue requires the Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity
in question” in s. 273.1(1) .

                    There
are essentially two approaches to determining the meaning of what constitutes
voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question and the role of mistake
or deception in determining whether such agreement existed.  The first approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending beyond the basic sexual
activity the complainant thought she was consenting to at the time to
conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences flowing from it,
provided these conditions are “essential features” of the sexual activity or go
to “how” the physical touching was carried out.  The second approach defines
“the sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical act
agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner.  If
the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1) .  That
voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. 

                    The
primary tools of statutory construction including the plain words of the
provisions, the scheme of the provisions and the legislative history support a
narrow interpretation of the basic definition of consent in s. 273.1(1) . The
jurisprudence and the provisions also support this interpretation. This Court
has interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code  in the context of HIV non‑disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. 
The adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out” approach
would be inconsistent with the approach adopted in Cuerrier and Mabior
and would put the outcome in those cases in question.  Under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach, mistakes — they need not be
deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result in
a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of risk of
harm.  For example, there would be no consent found under s. 273.1(1)  in
cases involving deception about HIV status, even where the accused had a low
viral load and condom protection was used.  Finally, adopting the “essential
features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would re-introduce
a vague and unclear test for consent, and could also criminalize conduct that
lacks the necessary reprehensible character, casting the net of the criminal
law too broadly. 

                    Properly
interpreted, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question in s. 273.1(1) 
means that the complainant must subjectively agree to the specific physical
act itself, its sexual nature and the specific identity of the partner. The
“sexual activity in question” does not include conditions or qualities of the
physical act, such as birth control measures or the presence of sexually
transmitted diseases.  Here, the “sexual activity in question” was sexual
intercourse and the complainant voluntarily agreed to it.  On the question of
whether her agreement to the “sexual activity in question” was vitiated by
fraud, the dishonesty is evident and admitted.  The only remaining issue is
whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish fraud.  Where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that expose her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant may constitute a sufficiently serious
deprivation to vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c).  This application
of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c) is consistent with Charter
values of equality and autonomy, while recognizing that not every deception
that induces consent should be criminalized. In this case, there was no consent
by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).

                    Per Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330,
to determine how sexual activity will take place.  Society’s commitment to
protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires that individuals have the
right to determine who touches their body, and how the touching
will occur.  This protection underlies the definition of consent set out in
s. 273.1(1)  as “the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in
the sexual activity in question”.  Consent to the “sexual activity in question”
necessarily means the complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in
touching of a sexual nature and to the manner in which that touching is carried
out.  The starting point for the analysis of consent under the actus reus
of sexual assault is s. 273.1(1) .  When a complainant does not voluntarily
agree to the sexual activity which occurred, consent does not exist within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for the purposes of the actus
reus of sexual assault is complete.  If there is no consent ab
initio, it is pointless to inquire whether there was fraud under s. 265(3) (c)
which would have vitiated the complainant’s consent.  In other words, without
voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual activity
in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) .


                    Unlike
under s. 265(3) (c), which requires both a dishonest act and
a deprivation, consent under s. 273.1(1)  has never
required an analysis of the risks or consequences caused by unwanted sexual
touching.  It is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual activity that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of non-consensual
touching by applying s. 265(3) (c) whenever deception is later
discovered, adds a barrier to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the
activity which occurred was agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby
undermines the values of personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be
protected by making sexual assault an offence.

                    It
does not follow that because a condom is a form of birth control, it is not
also part of the sexual activity.  Removing the use of a condom from the meaning of sexual activity in
s. 273.1(1)  because the condom may have been intended for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual has no right to
require the use of a condom during intercourse where pregnancy is not at
issue.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  By any definition, when
someone uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part
of what is — or is not — consented to.  When individuals agree to sexual
activity with a condom, they mean an intact condom.  They are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1)  was intended to protect. 

                    A
person consents to how she will be touched, and she is entitled
to decide what sexual activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she
wishes. The fact that some of the consequences of her motives are more serious
than others, such as pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right
to decide how the sexual activity she chooses to engage in is carried out.  It
is neither her partner’s business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary
agreement to the manner in which the sexual touching is carried out, requires
the complainant’s consent to where on her body she was touched and with what. 
It does not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or
the characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status,
or health.  These consequences or characteristics, while undoubtedly
potentially significant, are not part of the actual physical activity that is
agreed to.  

                    In
this case, the question is not whether consent was vitiated by fraud.  It is
whether there was consent to the sexual activity in the first place.  The
complainant agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is,
sexual intercourse with an intact condom.  H deliberately sabotaged the condom
without her knowledge or agreement.  The fact that she only learned of the
deliberate sabotaging after the sexual activity took place, is of no
relevance.  What is relevant is what sexual activity she agreed to engage in
with H and whether he stuck to the bargain.  In this case, he did not.  Since
the complainant did not agree to how she was touched at the time it occurred, consent
within the meaning of s. 273.1(1)  did not exist.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
Control over the sexual
activity one engages in lies at the core of human dignity and autonomy: R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at
para. 28. This principle underlies the offences of assault and sexual assault.
Sexual activity without consent is a crime under the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . 

[2]                             
In this case, the complainant consented to
sexual activity with a condom to prevent conception.  Unknown to her at the
time, her partner, Mr. Hutchinson,   poked holes in the condom and the
complainant became pregnant.  Mr. Hutchinson was charged with aggravated sexual
assault. The complainant said that she did not consent to unprotected sex. The
trial judge agreed and convicted Mr. Hutchinson of sexual assault (2011 NSSC
361, 311 N.S.R. (2d) 1).  The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, per
MacDonald C.J.N.S., upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection
was an essential feature of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant
did not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  Farrar J.A., dissenting,
held that there was consent to the sexual activity, but that a new trial was
required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud (2013 NSCA 1, 325
N.S.R. (2d) 95). 

[3]                             
The immediate problem is how cases such as this
fall to be resolved under the provisions of the Criminal Code .  This is
an issue of statutory interpretation.  Underlying this is a broader question —
where should the line between criminality and non-criminality be drawn when
consent is the result of deception? 

[4]                             
The Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to sexual
activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence establishes that
there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) . If the complainant consented, or her
conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of consent, the second step is
to consider whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate her apparent
consent. Section 265(3)  defines a series of conditions under which the law
deems an absence of consent, notwithstanding the complainant’s ostensible consent
or participation: Ewanchuk, at para. 36. Section 273.1(2)  also lists
conditions under which no consent is obtained. For example, no consent is
obtained in circumstances of coercion (s. 265(3) (a) and (b)),
fraud (s. 265(3) (c)), or abuse of trust or authority (ss. 265(3) (d)
and 273.1(2) (c)).  

[5]                             
We conclude that the
first step requires proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the
touching, its sexual nature, or the identity of the partner.   Mistakes on the
complainant’s part (however caused) in relation to other matters, such as
whether the partner is using effective birth control or has a sexually
transmitted disease, are not relevant at this stage. However, mistakes
resulting from deceptions in relation to other matters may negate consent at
the second stage of the analysis, under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .

[6]                             
Applying this template to the facts in this case
leads us to conclude that, at the first step, the complainant voluntarily
agreed to the sexual activity in question at the time that it occurred.  The
question is whether that consent was vitiated because she had been deceived as
to the condition of the condom.  This question is addressed at the second
step.  The accused’s condom sabotage constituted fraud within s. 265(3) (c),
with the result that no consent was obtained.  We would therefore affirm the
conviction and dismiss the appeal.

II.          
The Provisions of the Criminal Code 

[7]                             
Section 265(1)  of the Criminal Code  establishes
the general offence of assault:

                              265. (1) A person commits an assault when

 

                              (a) without the consent of
another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly
or indirectly;

 

                              (b) he attempts or threatens,
by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes
that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability
to effect his purpose; or

 

                              (c) while openly wearing or
carrying a weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person
or begs.

[8]                             
Section 265(2) states
that this section applies to all forms of assault, including sexual assault. 

[9]                             
The offence of sexual assault is created by s.
271 :

                              271. Everyone who commits a sexual assault is guilty of

 

                              (a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and, if the
complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum punishment of
imprisonment for a term of one year; or

 

                              (b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 18
months and, if the complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum
punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.

[10]                         
Section 273.1(1)  defines “consent” as follows:

                             273.1 (1)
Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.

[11]                         
These provisions define
the basic offence of sexual assault.  They are supplemented by two additional
sets of provisions which give a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which no
consent is obtained.  Section 265(3) , which applies to all assaults, lists four
such situations involving the accused’s abuse of authority and use of force,
fear and fraud:

                             265. . . . 

 

                             (3)  For the purposes of this section,
no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by
reason of

 

                              (a) the application of force to
the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) threats or fear of the
application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (c) fraud; or

 

                              (d) the exercise of authority.

[12]                         
Section 273.1(2) lists
five non-exhaustive situations where no consent is obtained for purposes of the
sexual assault offences:

                             273.1 . . .


 

                             (2) No consent is obtained, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , where

 

                              (a) the agreement is
expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) the complainant is
incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

                              (c) the accused induces the
complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or
authority;

 

                              (d) the complainant
expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;
or

 

                              (e) the complainant, having
consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack
of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

[13]                         
Section 273.1(1) makes
the definition of “consent” for the purposes of sexual assault “[s]ubject to”
subsection (2) and to s. 265(3) . Thus, s. 273.1(1) does not replace the
circumstances of no consent in ss. 273.1(2)  and 265(3) . Fraud, for example,
continues to negate consent to sexual assault, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).


III.       
Issue

[14]                         
The main issue here is
whether the Crown proved that the complainant did not consent to the sexual
touching by the appellant. Did the condom sabotage, as the majority of the
Court of Appeal held, result in there being no “voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code ? Or should the condom sabotage be analyzed, as the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal concluded, under the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code ?  

[15]                         
Resolving this issue
requires this Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity in
question” in s. 273.1(1) . 

[16]                         
The basic rule of statutory interpretation is that “the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at
 p. 1. The task is to determine the intent of Parliament, insofar as this
can be done, by looking at the words used and the scheme and object of the
provision.  Every part of a provision or set of provisions should be given
meaning if possible:  Sullivan, at p. 210.

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Sexual Autonomy and the Criminal Law: Overview

[17]                         
The sexual assault offences invoke the criminal law to protect sexual autonomy. The Criminal
Code  and jurisprudence establish a high level of protection of the right to
choose whether to engage in sexual activity and with whom.  The absence of
consent to sexual activity, as part of the actus reus of the offence, is
judged subjectively from the complainant’s point of view: Ewanchuk, at
paras. 25-26. Consent cannot be implied, must coincide with the sexual
activity, and may be withdrawn at any time.  Additionally, no consent is
obtained if the apparent agreement to the sexual activity is obtained by
coercion, fraud or abuse of authority.  (We note that this is a case of
apparent agreement — the complainant subjectively agreed at the time sexual
intercourse occurred.  This is not a case where there was no such
agreement.  The question is whether, in spite of that agreement, no consent was
obtained in law because that agreement was obtained as a result of Mr.
Hutchinson’s deceit about the condition of the condom.)  Individually and
collectively, these features of sexual assault law protect Canadians’ sexual
autonomy. 

[18]                         
But the law has long recognized that there are
limits on how completely it may fulfil that objective through the blunt
instrument of the criminal law. As the most serious interference by the state
with peoples’ lives and liberties, the criminal law should be used with appropriate
restraint, to avoid over-criminalization.  It draws a line between conduct
deserving the harsh sanction of the criminal law, and conduct that is
undesirable or unethical but “lacks the reprehensible character of criminal
acts”: R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 133; A. Wertheimer,
Consent to Sexual Relations (2003).  The companion of restraint is certainty. 
The criminal law must provide fair notice of what is prohibited and clear
standards for enforcement: R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at paras. 14 and 19. 

[19]                         
The need for restraint and certainty, which
sometimes work at cross-purposes to absolute protection of sexual autonomy, has
influenced the law’s approach to consent, particularly where consent has been
obtained by deception.

B.           
Interpreting the Provisions: Two Approaches 

[20]                         
There are essentially
two approaches to the question of what constitutes “voluntary agreement . . .
to . . . the sexual activity in question” and the role of mistake or deception
in determining whether such agreement existed.

[21]                         
The first approach,
which has many variants, defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending
beyond the basic sexual activity the complainant thought she was consenting to
at the time to conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences
flowing from it, provided these conditions are “essential features” of the
sexual activity (reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, at paras. 71
and 81) or go to “how” the physical touching was carried out (reasons of Abella
and Moldaver JJ.).  Under this approach, whether a complainant’s mistake
prevents voluntary agreement to the sexual activity under s. 273.1(1)  depends
on the nature of the mistake. The difficulty with this approach, as we shall
see, is that it provides no clear line between mistakes that result in no
consent under s. 273.1(1) , and mistakes that do not.  The result of this lack
of clarity may be inappropriate criminalization and uncertainty in the law. 

[22]                         
The second approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical
act agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner. 
If the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  That voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. The
Code also sets out a number of situations in which, notwithstanding
apparent agreement, no consent is obtained. In particular, deceptions may
negate consent if they meet the requirements for fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[23]                         
The choice between these
approaches is a matter of statutory construction.  Which approach is correct
depends on (1) the wording, scheme and object of the provisions of the Criminal
Code ; (2) the jurisprudence on the provisions and their common law
predecessors; and (3) the underlying objectives of the criminal law.  We will
consider each of these in turn.

(1) The Wording,
Scheme and Object of the Legislation and the Scheme of the Provisions

[24]                         
The plain words of the provisions, read in their ordinary and natural sense, support a narrow
interpretation of the basic definition of “consent” in s.  273.1(1) . The
ordinary meaning of the “sexual activity in question” is the physical act
agreed to; there is nothing in the wording to suggest that it includes the
conditions or qualifications of the sexual act.   

[25]                         
The scheme of the provisions — a basic
definition of “consent” in s. 273.1(1) , coupled with circumstances vitiating
such agreement in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2)  — also supports a narrow
interpretation of “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in
question”.  

[26]                         
The “essential features”
approach of the Court of Appeal and the “how the physical act is carried out”
approach of Abella and Moldaver JJ. do not conform to this two-part scheme. The
fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) deals with situations where consent to
the sexual activity has been given because of a deception by the accused. But
under these approaches, all deceptions about “essential features” of the sexual
activity or about “how” the sexual activity was carried out would result in a
finding of no consent to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) .
Many deceptions would be dealt with at the first step under s. 273.1(1) , rather
than where the scheme of the Criminal Code  suggests they should be dealt
with, under s. 265(3) (c). Section 273.1(1)  would do most of the work
that the fraud provision was intended to do, rendering the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) redundant in many cases, contrary to the principle that
every word and provision in a statute has a meaning and a function.

[27]                         
Finally, the object of
s. 273.1, as revealed by its legislative history, does not support a broad
reading of the “sexual activity in question”.  The definition of “consent” in
s. 273.1 was part of a parcel of amendments added to the Criminal Code 
in 1992, intended to address Parliament’s concerns about sexual violence
against women and children and to promote and ensure the full protection of s.
7  and s. 15  Charter  rights (see the preamble to Bill C-49, containing
the 1992 Criminal Code  amendments, S.C. 1992, c. 38). The centerpiece of
the revisions was a new provision narrowing the defence of honest belief of
consent. An accused who chooses to rely on the defence of honest belief of
consent is required to take reasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant
was consenting. Parliament’s intention was to “overcome the apparent
unwillingness by some to let go of the debunked notion that unless a
complainant physically resisted or expressed verbal opposition to sexual
activity, an accused was entitled to assume that consent existed”: R. v.
Ewanchuk, 1998 ABCA 52, 57 Alta. L.R. (3d) 235, at para. 58.  Section 273.1
therefore signalled that the focus should be on whether the complainant
positively affirmed her consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  There
was no suggestion that Parliament intended to expand the notion of “sexual
activity” by including not only the sexual act for which consent is required,
but also potentially infinite collateral conditions, such as the state of the condom.

[28]                         
In summary, the primary
tools of statutory construction all point to a rejection of the broad
interpretation of the “sexual activity in question” under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. 

          (2) The Jurisprudence

[29]                         
This Court has
interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code 
in the context of HIV non-disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. In
our view, adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out”
approach would put the outcomes in those cases in question and replace the
clarity and restraint achieved by those decisions with confusion and
over-criminalization. 

[30]                         
Initially, the common
law of fraud in sexual relations focussed on the nature of the deceit and asked
whether it went to certain “essential” characteristics of the act. If the
deception went to the sexual nature of the act or the identity of the partner,
it was said to vitiate consent: R. v. Clarence (1888), 22 Q.B.D. 23 (Cr.
Cas. Res.).  This test was incorporated into Canada’s first Criminal Code  in
1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29). Parliament restricted deceptions vitiating consent to
“false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act”
(ss. 259(b) and 266).  The formulation, however, did little to bring
certainty or rationality to the law of consent to sexual activity.  The problem
was where and how to draw the line between those aspects of the sexual activity
that went to the “nature and quality of the act” and those that did not: A.
Hooper, “Fraud in Assault and Rape” (1968), 3 U.B.C. L. Rev. 117, at p.
121.  Simply put, the “nature and quality of the act” did not show courts where
to draw the line — or even help them to do so —  between deceptions that did
and did not vitiate consent.

[31]                         
In view of this unsatisfactory state of affairs,
the Criminal Code  in relation to sexual offences was overhauled in 1983.
In 1983, the language of the “nature and quality of the act” was dropped and
the language of the present s. 265(3) (c) was adopted so that “no consent
is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of . . .
fraud” — without any specification of the nature of the deception (S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 19).

[32]                         
While for a time
Canadian courts continued to apply a restrictive interpretation of fraud,
influenced by the earlier jurisprudence concerning the “false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act”, the law of fraud in
relation to sexual assault, as we shall see, had a new beginning in Canadian
law with the Court’s judgment in Cuerrier. 

[33]                         
Three aspects of Cuerrier are
particularly important. First, the majority held that the concept of fraud in
the new s. 265(3) (c) was not restricted to deceptions as to the nature
and quality of the act: para. 108. The former jurisprudence was rejected as
being too restrictive, but at the same time, the majority recognized that some
limitations on the concept of fraud are clearly necessary: para. 135.  

[34]                         
Second, the majority
introduced an analysis of fraud that required two elements to be present before
consent was vitiated by fraud: deceit and injury or, expressed differently,
dishonesty and deprivation or risk of deprivation: Cuerrier, at paras.
110-16. With only two narrow exceptions that we will discuss shortly, consent
will be vitiated by fraud only when consent is obtained by lies or
deliberate failure to disclose coupled with a significant risk of
serious bodily harm as a result of the sexual touching:  paras. 125-39. As Cory
J. wrote for the majority, at para. 135: 

The existence of fraud should not
vitiate consent unless there is a significant risk of serious harm.  Fraud
which leads to consent to a sexual act but which does not have that significant
risk might ground a civil action. However, it should not provide the foundation
for a conviction for sexual assault.  The fraud required to vitiate consent
for that offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm. [Emphasis
added.]

[35]                         
Third, the majority
accepted that the traditional notion of fraud in relation to the nature and
quality of the act and the identity of the partner would continue to vitiate
consent: Cuerrier, at para. 118. We understand this to mean that
deceptions in relation to the sexual nature of the act and the identity of the
partner (narrowly defined) vitiate consent without proof that the sexual
activity gave rise to the risk of serious bodily harm.

[36]                         
The basic architecture of this approach was very
recently approved by the Court in Mabior. The Court said: 

. . . the
Cuerrier approach is in principle valid.  It carves out an
appropriate area for the criminal law — one restricted to “significant risk of
serious bodily harm”.  It reflects the Charter  values of autonomy,
liberty and equality, and the evolution of the common law, appropriately
excluding the Clarence line of authority.  The test’s approach to
consent accepts the wisdom of the common law that not every deception that
leads to sexual intercourse should be criminalized, while still according
consent meaningful scope. [Emphasis added; para. 58.]

[37]                         
The Court in Mabior explained how the Cuerrier
test applies to deceptions about HIV status. The Court concluded that HIV
non-disclosure will not vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c) if (1) the
accused’s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low; and (2) condom
protection was used. Notably, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity, under
s. 273.1(1)  was not in issue; the case proceeded on the basis that there had
been subjective consent to the sexual touching at the time it had occurred and
the only issue was whether fraud vitiated consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[38]                         
An approach that asks
whether the deception went to an “essential feature” of the act or “how the
sexual act was carried out” is inconsistent with the Court’s approach in Cuerrier
and Mabior.  Consider two hypotheticals.  In the first, the accused lies
about the fact that the condom has holes in it so that the complainant who
insists that he uses a condom will consent to the sexual activity.  In the
second, the accused lies about his HIV status so that the complainant will
consent to have sex without a condom.  From a legal perspective, what is the
difference between, on one hand, deceiving the complainant about the condition
of the condom and creating a risk of pregnancy, and on the other hand,
deceiving the complainant about HIV status so that she will agree to
unprotected sex?  Since Cuerrier, it is clear that the latter situation
must be analyzed under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  Why then not the former? Consistency and certainty in the law
require that both situations be treated the same. 

[39]                         
Both the Court of Appeal majority’s approach and
the approach proposed by Abella and Moldaver JJ. are also fundamentally at odds
with the holdings in Cuerrier and Mabior that apparent consent is
vitiated by fraud only where there is both deception and deprivation. Under the
Court of Appeal’s approach and that of our colleagues, mistakes — they need not
be deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result
in a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of harm or
risk of harm. This is contrary to the fundamental point made in Cuerrier
and affirmed in Mabior: “The fraud required to vitiate consent for that
offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm” (Cuerrier, at
para. 135).

[40]                         
These inconsistencies
are not merely semantic — they may affect outcomes under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. HIV status may well be an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity under the Court of Appeal majority’s
approach. It could also be characterized as part of the “how” under Abella and
Moldaver JJ.’s approach. If the use of an intact condom goes to the manner in
which the sexual activity occurred, why not the exchange of diseased fluids?
Thus, under these approaches, deceptions about HIV status could result in a
finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1) , even where the accused had a
low viral load at the relevant time and condom protection was used. That
conclusion, however, would be in direct conflict with Cuerrier and Mabior.


[41]                         
In short, adopting the “essential features”/“how
the act was carried out” approaches would make the law inconsistent, highly
formalistic and unduly uncertain.  The law would be
inconsistent because there is no reason in principle to analyze a case of a lie
that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a
condom differently.  It is highly formalistic because an error with respect to
any essential feature or “physical” element, presumably including whether a
condom is of a certain make or design, would vitiate consent while lies on
matters relating to the physical safety of the complainant would not, absent an
actual risk or harm.  It is uncertain because, as we shall see, it is difficult
to tell which matters form part of the “essential features” or the “how” and
which do not. 

(3)        Underlying Objectives of the Criminal Law: Restraint
and Certainty

[42]                         
Our jurisprudence has
consistently confirmed that in interpreting criminal law provisions, the twin
watchwords of restraint and clarity must inform the inquiry.  In Cuerrier
and Mabior, this Court narrowly limited the sorts of deceptions that
vitiate consent in order to create certainty in the law and limit criminal
liability to serious, reprehensible conduct. The Court held that deceptions
with respect to anything other than the sexual nature of the act or the
identity of the partner will only vitiate consent if there is dishonesty which
gives rise to a risk of physical harm, beyond the injury inherent in being lied
to in order to induce consent. This jurisprudence provides a clear line between
criminal and non-criminal conduct and avoids over-criminalization. Adopting the
“essential features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would
undercut the important objectives achieved by the Court’s jurisprudence.  These
approaches re-introduce a vague and unclear test for consent and broaden the
scope for criminalization, including for HIV non-disclosure, thus effectively
reversing this Court’s efforts to restrain and clarify the scope of
criminalization in those circumstances in Cuerrier and Mabior.


[43]                         
The Court of Appeal
majority’s “essential features” approach is inherently uncertain and prone to
over-criminalization.  Historically, such approaches have proven unworkable
because they are incapable of producing a sufficiently clear or restrained
standard for the purposes of defining the scope of criminal liability. 

[44]                         
The majority of the
Court of Appeal held that the “essential features” of the sexual activity are
determined by the complainant’s subjective conditions for consent to that
activity. There need be no deception or dishonesty on the part of the partner. 
It follows that the “essential features” of the sexual activity vary from
person to person. It would therefore be impossible to predict what a particular
person considers “essential”. It is also unclear how “essential” the feature
must be to the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal also held that
not all conditions for consent will be considered “essential features” of the
sexual activity; they drew the line between characteristics that merely affect
motive to engage in the sexual activity and characteristics that are
“components” of the sexual activity. But this line is blurry. We are told that
the use of an effective condom is a “component” of the sexual activity, not
part of the motive to engage in the sexual activity. Yet the elimination of the
risk of pregnancy may well be a motivation for agreeing to the sexual act.
Indeed, on the complainant’s evidence in this case, she would not have
consented to sex without a condom. 

[45]                         
Justices Abella and
Moldaver introduce a variation on this approach but one which, as we see it, is
equally uncertain. Under their approach, the “sexual activity in question”
extends to “how” the sexual touching occurs, but not to the consequences of the
sexual activity. But it is not clear what the “how” of the act includes, or
whether agreement is undermined by only deception or also by a complainant’s
unilateral mistake. Presumably, it extends to any physical aspect of the sexual
activity to which the complainant has not agreed in advance — a vast swath of
conduct indeed. And again, the line is blurry; many aspects of the sexual
activity can be characterized as both part of the “how” and part of the
consequences. This case provides an example. Abella and Moldaver JJ. hold that
a sabotaged condom is part of “how” the sexual touching occurred, but
sabotaging a condom also amounts to a deception about the potential
consequences of the physical act — namely, pregnancy. 

[46]                         
These approaches would
also result in the criminalization of acts that should not attract the heavy
hand of the criminal law. We have already noted the difficulty of seeing why
the presence of a sexually transmitted infection would not be a “component” of
the sexual activity or part of “how” the sexual touching occurs. Under the
Court of Appeal majority’s “essential features” test, a man who pierces a
condom may be found guilty of sexual assault; why would a woman who lies about
birth control measures not be equally guilty? Under Abella and Moldaver JJ.’s
test, the quality or effectiveness of a condom changes the sexual
activity that takes place; why would it not follow that an individual might be
prosecuted for using an expired condom or a particular brand of condom? 
Anomalies abound.  The “how the physical act was carried out” test appears not
to capture a woman who lies about taking birth control pills, but it might well
capture a woman who lies about using a diaphragm.  

[47]                         
Conversely, the “how the act was carried out”
approach would not capture conduct that is as equally reprehensible as Mr.
Hutchinson’s actions, like substituting a partner’s birth control pills with
sugar pills.  We do not see any principled basis for criminalizing the act of
sabotaging condoms, but not the act of sabotaging birth control pills.

[48]                         
This difficulty is
apparent on the facts of this case. The trial judge found that the complainant
did not voluntarily agree to sexual intercourse without contraception and that
Mr. Hutchinson knew this:  paras. 44 and 47. What was critical to her consent
was contraception and what she sought to mitigate was the risk of pregnancy. 
Yet on the approach adopted by our colleagues, her lack of voluntary agreement
would result from the use of sabotaged condoms, but not from a lie by Mr.
Hutchinson to the effect that he was sterile. These different results on the
issue of voluntary agreement respectfully lack rational justification in a case
such as this one in which the whole concern of the complainant was pregnancy —
a risked consequence of the sexual activity. Her consent did not turn on the
“how” of the sexual act, but on whether the risk of pregnancy was mitigated to
a degree which she thought sufficient.

[49]                         
Ultimately, these
approaches lead to empty semantic arguments incapable of furnishing a
principled and clear line between criminal and non-criminal conduct. This
conclusion is reinforced by the experience of other jurisdictions. 

[50]                         
We earlier referred to
the difficulties of line drawing inherent in the “nature and quality of the
act” test in Clarence and the Canadian Criminal Code until its
revision in 1983.  Courts experienced great difficulty in formulating
principled reasons for why a certain deception did or did not relate to the
nature and quality of the act and there was no principled basis upon which to
confine the test to serious deceptions meriting the ultimate force of the
criminal law:  see, e.g., Hooper; Cuerrier.  

[51]                         
A further example is the
distinction made in U.S. criminal and tort law between deceptions going to the
fact (“fraud in the factum”) which vitiate consent for the purposes of rape and
battery and other deceptions that act as inducements (“fraud in the
inducement”) which do not. As expressed by one leading text, the rule is that
“if the deception relates not to the thing done but merely to some collateral
matter” the consent is valid:  R. M. Perkins and R. N. Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd
ed. 1982), at p. 1079.  No matter how beguiling it appears at first, the
distinction has proved unworkable. It is not helpful in differentiating between
legally effective and ineffective consent and where it attempts to draw the
line has no basis in principle: see, e.g., P. J. Falk, “Rape by Fraud and Rape
by Coercion” (1998), 64 Brook. L. Rev. 39, at pp. 159-61; D. A. Fischer,
“Fraudulently Induced Consent to Intentional Torts” (1977), 46 U. Cin. L.
Rev. 71, at pp. 79, 87 and 98. As Peter Westen put it, “The
interchangeability of [fraud in the factum and fraud in the inducement] enables
courts and commentators to conceptualize any fraud that they regard as
sufficient to invalidate acquiescence as a fraud in the factum”: The Logic
of Consent (2004), at p. 198 (emphasis in original); see also, E. W.
Puttkammer, “Consent in Rape” (1924-1925), 19 Ill. L. Rev. 410, at p.
423; Wertheimer, at p. 206; J. Feinberg, “Victims’ Excuses: The Case of
Fraudulently Procured Consent” (1986), 96 Ethics 330.

[52]                         
What these lines of
authority have in common is that they, like the “essential features” or “how
the physical act is carried out” approach, attempt to draw a line between
deceptions that do and do not vitiate consent by adjectivally categorizing the
subject matter of the deception. Deceptions described as going to the “nature
and quality of the act” or the “fact” (as opposed to the “inducement”) vitiate
consent, while other types of deceptions do not.  But the attempted distinction
has proven to be too unclear, too easily manipulated, and too unconnected with
underlying policy rationales to provide a useful marker of liability.  

[53]                         
The lesson is clear.  Broad adjectival
approaches to the “sexual activity in question” produce not only uncertainty,
but also may criminalize conduct that lacks the necessary reprehensible
character, casting the net of the criminal law too broadly. There is no reason
to expect that attempting to categorize deceptions as to whether they go to the
“essential features” of the act or to “how the physical act is carried out”
will fare any better that did other adjectival approaches in the past.

C.           
The Correct Approach

[54]                         
We conclude that Farrar
J.A. was correct to interpret the “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
to refer simply to the physical sex act itself (for example, kissing, petting,
oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys). The complainant must agree to
the specific physical sex act. For example, as our colleagues correctly
note, agreement to one form of penetration is not agreement to any or all forms
of penetration and agreement to sexual touching on one part of the body is not
agreement to all sexual touching.  

[55]                         
The “sexual activity in question” does not
include conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control
measures or the presence of sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, at the first
stage of the consent analysis, the Crown must prove a lack of subjective
voluntary agreement to the specific physical sex act. Deceptions about
conditions or qualities of the physical act may vitiate consent under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code , if the elements for fraud are
met. 

[56]                         
This approach fits within the ordinary meaning of s. 273.1(1)  and the scheme of the Code,
and it does not pose problems of uncertainty, over-criminalization, or
inconsistency with Cuerrier and Mabior. 

[57]                         
In our view, “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the
sexual activity in question” also encompasses both the sexual nature of the
activity (i.e., that the act was sexual in nature as opposed to being for a
different purpose, such as a medical examination) and the identity of the
partner (defined in the narrow sense of the specific identity of a partner who
is personally known to the complainant). While identity and the sexual nature
of the act were troublesome issues for the early cases, and while Cuerrier,
in obiter, suggests that they might be considered at the second stage of
the consent analysis under s. 265(3) (c), the better view is that
“voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in question” will not
exist under s. 273.1(1)  if the complainant did not subjectively agree to the
sexual nature of the act or the specific identity of the partner. As a result,
a complainant’s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner or the sexual
nature of the act — whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception —
will result in no consent under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

[58]                         
The sexual nature of the act is
expressly included by the reference in s. 273.1(1)  to the “sexual
activity in question”. If one voluntarily agrees to a non-sexual activity (for
example, a medical examination), one is not voluntarily agreeing to a sexual
activity.  Similarly, in our view, the identity of the partner, in the narrow
sense, should be included in the “sexual activity in question” under s.
273.1(1) ; if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific
individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with
B.  

[59]                         
A number of early cases support this interpretation. For example, in R.
v. Flattery (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 410 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the court upheld a
conviction of rape where a man obtained sex from a girl on the pretext of
medical treatment. The court noted that the case was not a case where a man
induced consent to sex through fraud; rather, the victim consented to a surgical
operation — not to a sexual act. Thus, there was no consent to any sexual
activity. 

[60]                         
Similarly, R. v. Dee (1884), 14 L.R. Ir. 468 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the
court upheld a conviction of rape where a man pretended to be the victim’s
husband. May C.J. stated that “[t]he act she permitted cannot properly be
regarded as the real act which took place; therefore, the connexion was done,
in my opinion, without her consent, and the crime of rape was constituted” (p.
479). 

[61]                         
In Dee, Palles C.B. stated:

. . . an act done under the bona
fide belief that it is another act different in its essence is not
in law the act of the party. That is the present case — a case which it is
hardly necessary to point out is not that of consent in fact sought to be
avoided for fraud, but one in which that which took place never amounted to
consent. The person by whom the act was to be performed was part of its
essence. The consent of the intellect, the only consent known to the law, was
to the act of the husband only . . . . [Emphasis in original; p. 488.]

[62]                         
In Clarence, Stephen J. acknowledged that there is abundant
authority for the idea that frauds about identity or the sexual nature of the
act vitiate consent. However, he commented:

I should myself prefer to say that
consent in such cases does not exist at all, because the act consented to is
not the act done. Consent to a surgical operation or examination is not a
consent to sexual connection or indecent behaviour. Consent to connection with
a husband is not consent to adultery. [p. 44]

[63]                         
More recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. G.C., 2010 ONCA 451, 266 O.A.C.
299, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach
and held that the complainant’s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when
it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the “sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1  of the Criminal Code . (See also R.
v. O.A., 2013 ONCA 581, 310 O.A.C. 305.)

V.          
Application

[64]                         
The first question is
whether the complainant voluntarily agreed to the “sexual activity in
question”. On the approach we propose, the “sexual activity in question” was
the sexual intercourse that took place in this case. Effective condom use is a
method of contraception and protection against sexually transmitted disease; it
is not a sex act. 

[65]                         
There is no dispute that the complainant
subjectively consented to sexual intercourse with Mr. Hutchinson at the time
that it occurred. We conclude that the Crown did not prove that there was no
voluntary agreement to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code . 

[66]                         
The next question is whether any of the
circumstances in which voluntary agreement is not effective apply. These
circumstances are listed in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2) . The only provision
argued is s. 265(3) (c). So the key issue is whether the complainant’s
agreement to the sexual activity in question was vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code . 

[67]                         
As we have seen, “fraud”
for the purposes of consent has two elements: (1) dishonesty, which can include
the non-disclosure of important facts; and (2) deprivation or risk of
deprivation in the form of serious bodily harm which results from the
dishonesty (Cuerrier). Did the Crown prove that no consent was obtained
by virtue of fraud?

[68]                         
The dishonesty in this
case is evident and admitted. Mr. Hutchinson obtained the complainant’s consent
to sexual intercourse only by failing to disclose the critical fact that he had
sabotaged the condoms and thereby compromised their contraceptive value. The
only remaining issue is whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish
fraud.  

[69]                         
Mr. Hutchinson argues
that the universal threshold for deprivation under s. 265(3) (c) post-Cuerrier
is a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”, and that the Crown did not
establish that here.  The Crown argues that a new trial is required to
determine whether the risk of pregnancy caused by the sabotaged condoms
constituted a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”. These arguments
over-read Cuerrier.  The Court in Cuerrier was addressing the
specific risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  It did not foreclose the
possibility that other types of harm may amount to equally serious deprivations
and therefore suffice to establish the requirements of fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[70]                         
The concept of “harm”
does not encompass only bodily harm in the traditional sense of that term; it
includes at least the sorts of profound changes in a woman’s body — changes
that may be welcomed or changes that a woman may choose not to accept —
resulting from pregnancy. Depriving a woman of the choice whether to become
pregnant or increasing the risk of pregnancy is equally serious as a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” within the meaning of Cuerrier,
and therefore suffices to establish fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c).


[71]                         
We conclude that where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that deprive her of
the benefit of that choice by making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant by removing effective birth control, may
constitute a sufficiently serious deprivation for the purposes of fraud
vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[72]                         
This application of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c)
is consistent with Charter  values of equality and autonomy, while
recognizing that not every deception that induces consent should be
criminalized. To establish fraud, the dishonest act must result in a
deprivation that is equally serious as the deprivation recognized in
Cuerrier and in this case. For example, financial deprivations or mere
sadness or stress from being lied to will not be sufficient.

[73]                         
In this case, while the
Crown did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant’s
pregnancy was the result of the damaged condoms, Mr. Hutchinson exposed her to
an increased risk of becoming pregnant by using a faulty condom.  As the trial
judge found, a condom with a pinprick in it is no longer effective birth
control (para. 27).  This constituted a sufficient deprivation for fraud, within
the meaning established in Cuerrier.

[74]                         
We conclude that there
was no consent in this case by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .  Mr. Hutchinson is therefore guilty of
sexual assault.

VI.       
Disposition

[75]                         
We would dismiss the
appeal. 

                    The reasons of Abella,
Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. were delivered by

[76]                         
Abella and
Moldaver JJ. — This case involves a woman who agreed to sexual intercourse with a condom.  When a
woman agrees to have sexual intercourse with a condom, she is consenting to a
particular sexual activity.  It is a different sexual activity than sexual
intercourse without a condom.  Her reasons for requiring a condom as
part of the activity may be to prevent pregnancy, or they may be a matter of
personal preference.  But whatever her reasons, they are beyond the scope of
the criminal law.  What is within its scope is what she actually agreed
to, not why.  The deliberate and undisclosed thwarting of her agreement as to
how the intercourse is to take place turns the sexual activity into a
non-consensual act, regardless of its consequences.  This engages s. 273.1(1) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , whose purpose is to
ascertain whether there was consent to the activity in the first place.  This
is, first and foremost, a function of everyone’s right to decide whether and
how to engage in sexual activity.

[77]                         
The factual events which
gave rise to these proceedings are not in dispute.  The complainant agreed to
have sexual intercourse with Craig Hutchinson with a condom so that she would
not get pregnant. Condom use, therefore, clearly meant an intact condom.  Mr.
Hutchinson secretly poked holes in the condom and used it during sexual
intercourse.  The complainant only learned of this when he later told her what
he had done.  At trial, Mr. Hutchinson was convicted of sexual assault under s.
271  of the Criminal Code .

[78]                         
The issue before this
Court is which Criminal Code  provision applies in examining whether
there was consent.  The trial judge and a majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
found that s. 273.1(1)  applied and concluded that under that provision, there
was no consent to the sexual activity in question.  The dissenting judge was of
the view that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse generally and
that the condom was not part of the sexual activity.  He would have ordered a
new trial to determine whether the consent had been vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c). 

[79]                         
We would dismiss the appeal.  The starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1) .  The question is not whether consent was
vitiated by fraud, it is whether there was consent to the sexual activity in
the first place.  In our view, there was no such consent, making s. 273.1(1) 
the applicable provision.  The complainant in this case agreed to engage in sexual
activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual intercourse with a condom.  It
goes without saying that when someone agrees to sexual intercourse with a
condom, she is agreeing to sexual intercourse with an intact condom. 
The deliberate sabotaging of that condom without her knowledge or agreement
makes what happened different from what the complainant agreed to.      Since
the complainant never agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with a sabotaged
condom, there is therefore no consent under s. 273.1(1)  and the inquiry for the
purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.

Analysis

[80]                         
The relevant provisions,
s. 273.1(1)  and s. 265(3) (c), state:

     273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the purposes of
sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question.

 

265.
. . .

 

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where
the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of 

 

(a)
the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the
complainant;

 

(b)
threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person
other than the complainant;

 

(c)
fraud; or

 

(d)
the exercise of authority.

[81]                         
In R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
330, this Court set out the governing framework for
analyzing whether the elements of sexual assault are met in a given case.  The mens
rea for sexual assault requires the accused to have knowledge of, or be
willfully blind to, the complainant’s lack of consent.  The central focus of
the analysis of the actus reus of sexual assault, on the other hand, is
to determine what the complainant agreed to, and what in fact took place.  The actus
reus requires proof of three elements: “(i) touching, (ii) the sexual
nature of the contact, and (iii) the absence of consent” (para. 25).  While the
first two elements are determined objectively, the third — the absence of
consent — “is subjective and determined by reference to the complainant’s
subjective internal state of mind towards the touching, at the time it
occurred” (para. 26).  It is the third component of the actus reus that
we are concerned with in this appeal. 

[82]                         
In Ewanchuk, the foundational principles underlying the law of sexual assault were distilled by
Major J. as follows:

Society is committed to protecting the
personal integrity, both physical and psychological, of every individual.
Having control over who touches one’s body, and how, lies at the
core of human dignity and autonomy. The inclusion of assault and sexual assault
in the Code expresses society’s determination to protect the security of
the person from any non-consensual contact or threats of force. The common law
has recognized for centuries that the individual’s right to physical integrity
is a fundamental principle, “every man’s person being sacred, and no other
having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner” . . . .  It
follows that any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal.  [Emphasis
added; para. 28.]

[83]                         
In other words,
society’s commitment to protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires
that individuals have the right to determine who touches their body, and
how the touching will occur.  The right to determine how sexual
touching is to occur clearly encompasses a person’s right to determine where
one’s body is touched and by what means.  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in Ewanchuk to determine how sexual
touching will take place.

[84]                         
This protection
underlies the definition of consent set out in s. 273.1(1)  as being “the
voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in
question”.  When it defined consent in s. 273.1(1)  in this way in 1992,
Parliament’s intent was to address the “fundamental” issue of giving full and
clear meaning to the concept of “consent” (Kim Campbell, Minister of Justice
and Attorney General of Canada, House of Commons Debates, vol. IX, 3rd
Sess., 34th Parl., June 15, 1992, at pp. 12027-28; see also pp. 12041 and
12043). As another parliamentarian explained:

     Consent is the crux of
sexual assault trials. If it has been established that consent has been given,
the woman’s claim of attack is rejected. It is imperative that the law be
absolutely clear on this matter, as must the partners involved in the sexual
activity.

 

     The bill states that
consent is the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question. There is no need for lawyers to be present. All you need
are two people who understand each other’s needs . . . . 

 

(Shirley
Maheu, M.P. from Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, ibid., at p. 12045)

[85]                         
Since the protection of
personal integrity underlies the requirement for consent in s. 273.1(1) ,
consent to the “sexual activity in question” necessarily means the
complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in touching of a sexual nature
and to the manner in which that touching is carried out.  In other words,
without voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual
activity in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s.
273.1(1) .

[86]                         
The dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal, like McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J., concluded that the
specific sexual activity in question here was “sexual intercourse”.  Since the
complainant consented to sexual intercourse, there was consent within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) .  In the dissenting judge’s view, the term “sexual
activity” in s. 273.1(1)  has a narrow meaning, referring only to “actual
incidents of physical touching, whether oral sex, or intercourse, or another
‘category’ of activity, and not to the conditions of that touching” (para.
127 (emphasis in original)).  With respect, adverting to generic, categorical
labels of sexual activity obscures the purpose of the consent inquiry regarding
the actus reus of sexual assault.  The complainant must consent to the
sexual touching which actually took place (Ewanchuk, at
para. 26).  And this Court confirmed in R. v. J.A., [2011] 2
S.C.R. 440, that the relevant time for determining that consent is when the
activity occurred.  To interpret “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
without regard to the specific touching that occurs extinguishes the right of a
person to decide whether to give or withhold consent to the sexual activity
which is to take place.  

[87]                         
The dissenting judge’s
technical definition of “sexual activity in question” also suggests that once a
person consents to a “category” of sexual activity, the inquiry goes to s.
265(3)  to determine whether that general consent was vitiated.  This, with
respect, reads out the protection in Ewanchuk for the “how” of the
sexual touching.  A person who has consented to being touched over her clothing
above the waist, is not consenting to being touched under her clothing below
the waist. Both instances are “touching”, but only one was agreed to.  In the
same way, agreeing to “penetration” does not thereby mean consenting to any or
all forms or penetration. The notion that general consent is given under s.
273.1(1)  so long as the other person’s actions fall somewhere within the
generic category of what the complainant agreed to, such as touching or
penetration, is untenable.  It represents the triumph of terminology over
personal integrity and completely undermines Ewanchuk’s basic principle
that “any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal” by virtue of
the fact that it was unwanted (para. 28 (emphasis added)).

[88]                         
A person consents to how
she will be touched, and she is entitled to decide what sexual
activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she wishes. The fact that
some of the consequences of her motives are more serious than others, such as
pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right to decide the manner
of the sexual activity she wants to engage in.  It is neither her partner’s
business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary agreement to the manner
in which the sexual touching was carried out, requires the complainant’s
consent to where on her body she was touched and with what.  It does
not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or the
characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status, or
health.  These consequences or characteristics, while potentially significant,
are not part of the actual physical activity that is agreed to.  If we included
them in the meaning of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) , we
would be criminalizing activity that thwarts the motives of a
complainant, instead of focussing on the unwanted physical activity that
actually took place.  To state the proposition demonstrates its unacceptable
reach.  While it is true that the third element of the actus reus — the
complainant’s absence of consent to the touching —is a subjective inquiry, it
must nonetheless relate to the specific way in which he or she is touched, not
to why.  The avoidance or pursuit of pregnancy may well motivate why the
specific sexual activity is being agreed to, but the motivation for the sexual
activity is not the sexual activity itself.  

[89]                         
That is why we would not adopt the
“essential features” test proposed by the majority of the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal, under which “if there is no consent to an essential feature of the
sexual act itself, there can be no consent to ‘the sexual activity in
question’” (para. 46).  By focussing on what is an “essential” feature of the
sexual activity to the complainant, there is a risk of capturing “features”
which are not a part of the how of the sexual activity.  In other words,
the language of “essential features” opens the door to a broader inquiry than
whether the complainant consented specifically to the sexual touching which
occurred.  To the extent that our colleagues have conflated our approach
with the “essential features” test, it does not, with respect, reflect our
reasons.

[90]                         
But neither do we agree
that the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) must be the framework for
analyzing consent in sexual assault cases whenever deception is involved.  When
a complainant does not voluntarily agree to the sexual activity which occurred,
consent does not exist within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for
the purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.  

[91]                         
Unlike under s. 265(3) (c), which
requires both a dishonest act and a deprivation, consent
under s. 273.1(1)  has never required an analysis of the risks or consequences
caused by unwanted sexual touching.  This Court has consistently affirmed that
it is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual touching that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of all
non-consensual sexual touching if deception is later discovered, adds a barrier
to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the activity which occurred was
agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby undermines the values of
personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be protected by making
sexual assault an offence.  

[92]                         
Regardless of whether deception occurred in a
given case, the analysis under s. 273.1(1)  must link consent to the specific
sexual activity which occurred, including how the sexual touching was
physically carried out.  In other words, did the complainant consent to where
she was touched and by what?  We therefore think the following two-part
test for analyzing consent under the actus reus of sexual assault flows
inevitably from Ewanchuk:

Under s.
273.1(1), has the complainant consented to the identity of her sexual partner,
the sexual nature of the touching, and the manner in which the sexual touching
was carried out? 

If so, are
there any circumstances that vitiate the complainant’s consent under s.
265(3) ?  

[93]                         
This approach does not,
as our colleagues suggest, “do most of the work that the fraud provision was
intended to do”.  What it does do, is give meaning to the word
“consent”.  Indeed, as our colleagues themselves point out, there are many
situations in which a person’s deception does not change the manner in which
the sexual activity is actually carried out. Section 265(3) (c) may well
apply to those deceptions that do not fall under s. 273.1(1), either because
the deception does not go to the manner in which a person is touched, does not
involve the identity of one’s partner, or does not pertain to the sexual nature
of the touching.  If there was no consent ab initio to the sexual
activity, however, it is pointless to inquire under s. 265(3) (c) whether
consent was vitiated by fraud.  The two inquiries are conceptually distinct and
must remain so.  One goes to the manner in which the sexual touching is
carried out, the other to the consequences of the sexual touching.  The
fact that the violation of someone’s consent results in a deprivation does not
change the fact that there was no consent to begin with.  

[94]                         
In our view, both R. v. Cuerrier,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, and R. v. Mabior, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, are
examples of cases that were properly decided under s. 265(3) (c).  In
those cases, this Court set out the applicable approach to sexual assault cases
under s. 265(3) (c) involving non-disclosure or deception as to the
existence of a disease.  The complainants had consented to the manner in
which the sexual activity had been carried out, the identity of their sexual
partner, and the sexual nature of that touching.  The complainants had
consented to sex with and, in some cases, without condoms, and the sexual
intercourse took place in accordance with that agreement.  The significant
issue before the Court was whether the complainants’ consent had been vitiated
by fraud because the accused had not disclosed that he was HIV-positive (Cuerrier,
at para. 77; Mabior, at para. 106).[1] 
As the risk of HIV transmission is a consequence of sexual activity, and the
complainants had consented to the manner in which the sexual activity occurred,
these cases were properly decided within the realm of s. 265(3) (c).  There are, moreover, important policy considerations that justify
deciding HIV non-disclosure cases under s. 265(3) (c).  Requiring a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” in HIV non-disclosure cases ensures
that the criminal law does not further stigmatize and criminalize an already
vulnerable group.  

[95]                         
This approach was never intended to replace the
governing framework for analyzing consent in sexual assault cases set out in Ewanchuk.  
By further redefining the deprivation component of the fraud test affirmed in Mabior
only two years ago, our colleagues leave open the possibility that other
“equally serious deprivations” could establish deprivation in future cases. 
This makes the deprivation component a moving target, and generates uncertainty
in an already complex area.  

[96]                         
While the starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1), unlike our colleagues, we see no legal danger
or uncertainty in recognizing that in a given case, lack of consent could
theoretically have been established under either provision. What is
fraught, however, is redefining the concept of consent in a way that
significantly limits the protective scope of s. 273.1(1) and erodes a person’s right, confirmed in Ewanchuk,
to decide what sexual activity will take place.  

[97]                         
The heart of our disagreement with McLachlin
C.J. and Cromwell J. turns on whether the use of a condom is included in the
manner in which the sexual activity is carried out.  According to our
colleagues, the use of a condom during sexual intercourse does not change the “specific
physical sex act” which occurs, but rather is merely a “collateral conditio[n]”
to the sexual activity.  In their view, so long as there is consent to “sexual
intercourse”, this general consent is not vitiated by a deception about condom
use unless it exposes the individual to a deprivation within the meaning of s.
265(3) (c), which they conclude in this case means depriving a woman of
the choice to become pregnant by “making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant”.

[98]                         
With respect, it does not follow that because a
condom is a form of birth control, it is not also part of the sexual activity. 
Removing the use of a condom from the ambit of what is consented to in the
sexual activity because in some cases it may be used for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual is precluded from requiring a condom during
intercourse where pregnancy is not at issue.  That is, individuals who
engage in sexual activity that has no risk of pregnancy, either because of age,
fertility, or gender, for example, would have no legal right to insist upon the
use of a condom.  If one of those individuals has insisted upon the use of a
condom, and their partner has deliberately and knowingly ignored
those wishes — whether by not using a condom at all, removing it partway
through the sexual activity, or sabotaging it — that individual will
nonetheless be presumed to have consented under the approach suggested by our
colleagues.  In other words, because the person could not become pregnant, the
criminal law will not uphold his or her right to sexual autonomy and physical
integrity.  With respect, even aside from the problematic analogy between
pregnancy and bodily harm, this result does not reflect the fact that everyone
has a right to insist on a condom as part of the sexual activity — for whatever
reason.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  We fail to see how condoms
can be seen as anything but an aspect of how sexual touching occurs.  When
individuals agree to sexual activity with a condom, they are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1) was intended to protect.

[99]                         
It is worth remembering
that three decades ago, this Court overturned a decision of the New Brunswick
Court of Appeal, R. v. Chase (1984), 55 N.B.R. (2d) 97, that touching a
woman’s breast was an assault, but not a sexual one.  The Court of Appeal
concluded that a breast was only a “secondary” sexual characteristic and that
“sexual” should be given “its natural meaning as limited to the sexual organs
or genitalia”.   A man who had grabbed a woman’s breasts had therefore
committed an assault, but not a sexual assault, since

the contact was not with the
sexual organs of the victim but to the mammary gland, a secondary sexual
characteristic. 

 

. .
. to include as sexual an assault to the parts of a person’s body considered as
having secondary sexual characteristics may lead to absurd results if one
considers a man’s beard. Nor am I prepared to include those parts of the human
body considered erogenous zones lest a person be liable to conviction for
stealing a goodnight kiss. . . .  It seems to me that the word “sexual” as used
in the section ought to be given its natural meaning as limited to the sexual
organs or genitalia. [paras. 13-14]

In this Court, McIntyre
J., had “no difficulty” overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, concluding
instead that a sexual assault had been committed by the accused ([1987] 2
S.C.R. 293, at p. 303). 

[100]                     
To say that condom use
is not part of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) but rather a
collateral condition, is reminiscent of the artificially narrow approach to the
word “sexual” taken by the Court of Appeal in Chase and rejected by this
Court. We must similarly take care not to adopt an interpretation of “sexual
activity in question” that unreasonably or arbitrarily excludes certain forms
of touching from the meaning of s. 273.1(1).  By any definition, when someone
uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part of what
is — or is not — consented to.  And if what is consented to is sexual activity
with a condom, the condom is expected to be intact.  If it is not intact because
of its deliberate sabotaging, the activity that has been agreed to has been
unilaterally changed by the saboteur.  

[101]                     
What took place here was sexual intercourse with
a sabotaged condom, a sexual activity to which the complainant did not
consent.  The fact that she only learned of the deliberate sabotaging after
the sexual activity took place, is of no relevance.  What is relevant is what
sexual activity she agreed to engage in with Mr. Hutchinson and whether he
stuck to the bargain.  He did not.  Since the complainant did not agree at any
time to how she was touched, consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) did not
exist. 

[102]                     
Nor can we see why
requiring the consistent approach to consent in sexual assault set out in Ewanchuk
— and never abandoned by this Court — can now be said to lead to
“over-criminalization”.  Sexual assault is a crime.  What s. 273.1(1) does is
explain, clearly and simply, that the actus reus of sexual assault is
made out when someone does not agree to the manner of the sexual touching, that
is, when an individual engages in sexual touching in a way that is contrary to
the complainant’s wishes, thereby violating his or her bodily integrity. This
on its own, however, is half the story.  The mens rea for the offence of
sexual assault captures those who knowingly touch the complainant in a
way that he or she has not agreed to, thereby disregarding the complainant’s
right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  While the criminal law
must remain sensitive to concerns about over-criminalization, those concerns
should not be used to generally undermine the hard-fought legislative protection
for someone’s right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  It is also
worth remembering the Chief Justice’s comments in J.A. — with the
Court’s unanimous agreement on this point — where she observed that “even mild
non-consensual touching of a sexual nature can have profound implications for
the complainant” (paras. 63 and 121).

[103]                     
The complainant in this
case agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual
intercourse with an intact condom.  Mr. Hutchinson deliberately sabotaged the
condom without her knowledge or agreement.  It trivializes the seriousness of
the violation of the complainant’s integrity that occurred to analogize a
sabotaged condom, as our colleagues have done, to its brand or expiration
date.  Because of the deliberate deceit of her partner, the sexual activity was
not carried out in the manner that the complainant had agreed to.  Put simply,
the complainant did not consent to how she was touched, and thus she did not
voluntarily agree to the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1 of the Code.

[104]                     
We would therefore dismiss the appeal.

    1 HIS HONOUR: Khaled Sharrouf, who I shall hereafter refer to as ""the accused"", was arrested on 8 November 2005. He was charged, I am informed, with an offence of conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. He has been in custody since that time. The accused and his alleged co-conspirators faced committal proceedings during the early part of 2007. He was, along with the others, committed to stand trial on 30 April 2007. On 31 May 2007 he and his co-accused were arraigned before me in the Supreme Court.  
     
      
    2 An indictment, signed by Paul Shaw for and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was presented on that day by the Crown Prosecutor. The charge in the indictment, leaving aside the particulars, was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, charges in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 31 May 2007 that Omar Baladjam, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, Mohammed Omar Jamal, Mirsad Mulahalilovic, Khaled Sharrouf and Mazen Touma between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts."" 
        
       
      
    3 The charge arises from sections 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. To this charge the accused and the other men pleaded not guilty.  
     
      
    4 On the same day, the trial, including a range of contemplated pre-trial applications, was set down for hearing on 25 February 2008. The pre-trial procedures are to be completed so far as they possibly can be before a jury is empanelled. They began in fact on 25 February 2008 and have been continuing since that day. It is likely they will continue for some months.  
     
      
    5 Mr Brewer and Mr Michael Pickin appear for the accused Khaled Sharrouf. Mr Geoff Bellew SC appears for the Crown on the present application. Both the Crown and Mr Pickin have raised the issue of the accused's unfitness to be tried. Relevantly, a motion filed on behalf of the accused raising the issue was first notified to the Court in November 2007. It is agreed between the parties that this Court is exercising Federal jurisdiction, but that by virtue of sections 68(1) and 79 of the Judiciary Act (Commonwealth) a range of State laws relating to procedures for trial are, in general terms, to apply to the accused in connection with the offence with which he is charged. 
     
      
    6 It.Is also common ground between the parties that in relation to the narrow issue of determination of unfitness, the New South Wales legislation known as the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 governs the procedures to be followed.  
     
      
    7 There is, subject to one qualification I will mention later, no Commonwealth legislation dealing with the procedure to be adopted in this Court in determining an initial issue of fitness. Certainly there is no Commonwealth legislation governing the procedure to be followed in the present substantive application, although there is legislation governing the procedures subsequently to be adopted in the event that an accused person is to be found unfit (see sections 20B and following of the Crimes Act Commonwealth).  
     
      
    8 A preliminary issue has arisen. It is within a narrow compass. The essential question is whether the fitness hearing, as I shall for convenience call it, is to proceed before a judge and jury, or before a judge alone. The issue arises in the following circumstances: Prior to 1 January 2006 a fitness hearing was to be held with a jury, unless the accused made an election to have the issue determined by a judge alone. The legislation, as it operated prior to 1 January 2006, created on occasions significant problems for the legal representatives of an accused person where a fitness issue had arisen. How could the lawyers be satisfied they had operable and effective instructions from the client, when the fitness issue raised concerns about the fundamental ability of that client to understand and make decisions regarding issues in the proceedings generally?  
     
      
    9 The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act 2005 altered the situation significantly. This legislation came into force on 1 January 2006. It inserted into the legislation by virtue of schedule 1(4) section 11(1) which is now in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “11(1) The question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the judge alone."" 
        
       
      
    10 Of course, the amending Act made other significant changes as well. It is not necessary to recite or refer to these, however, in relation to the narrow issue I have to determine. Those other changes may become relevant at a later stage if a finding of unfitness is made. It is important, however, to note that there was also enacted what might be described as a transitional provision. It was created by schedule 1(4). The provision is in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “An amendment made by schedule 1(4)…applies to proceedings for offences whether or not the offences were committed before, on or after the commencement of the amendment. It does not apply to proceedings commenced before the commencement of the amendment.” 
        
       
      
    11 The issue I have posed for determination will be answered by a consideration of two questions: First, what is meant by the word ""proceedings"" where it appears in the transitional provision? Secondly, depending on the answer to the first question, when were those proceedings relevantly commenced in the case of Mr Sharrouf?  
     
      
    12 The Crown has urged the court to find, first, that the term ""proceedings"" should be construed as meaning the proceedings which are currently before this Court; secondly, to find that such proceedings commenced when the indictment was first presented on 31 May 2007. It will follow, if these submissions are accepted, that the procedures in the new section 11 are to govern the fitness hearing.  
     
      
    13 Mr Pickin, on the other hand, urges the Court to find that the term ""proceedings"" is to be given a wider and less restricted meaning than that suggested by the Crown. Counsel submits the expression could and should embrace the initial charging of the accused by the police in November 2005. So construed, the proceedings would have commenced prior to 1 January 2006. Importantly, Mr Pickin submits that the section 11 amendment removes a traditional right to a determination of fitness by a jury of peers. Mr Pickin submits that, for this reason, the Court should be cautious in accepting the interpretation urged by the Crown. 
     
      
    14 In my view, the submissions of the Crown in relation to the preliminary issue are to be preferred. The first issue to be determined is the meaning of the term ""proceedings"" in the transitional provision. In turn, this provision directly relates to Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The application of Part 2 is stated in section 4 of the legislation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Application 
        
       
       
        
        4. This Part applies to criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court (including criminal proceedings within the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and criminal proceedings in the District Court.” 
        
       
      
    15 Secondly, section 5 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Person by whom question of unfitness may be raised 
        
       
       
        
        The question of as person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the Court.” 
        
       
      
    16 The presence of the term ""proceedings"" in this section reinforces that the same term where it appears in the transitional provisions is a reference to criminal proceedings either in the Supreme Court or the District Court and to no other.  
     
      
    17 Further support for this construction is to be found in sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Act. The issue as to fitness may be raised before arraignment but, once again, the sections proceed on the basis that the issue will arises in the Supreme Court or District Court proceedings. Section 10 further reinforces the same conclusion.  
     
      
    18 In the course of his argument, Mr Pickin referred to the fact that committal proceedings are usually commenced by a court attendance notice, known as a CAN (section 47 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and that trial proceedings in the lower courts are commenced in those courts by the issue and filing of a CAN (ss 172 and 178 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986). This in each case is undoubtedly so. But essentially, for the reasons I have stated, the term ""proceedings"" in the transitional provisions is not apt to refer to proceedings of that type, but rather it is concerned with criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court and District Court.  
     
      
    19 Mr Pickin also referred to s 20B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. This section, the practical application of which neither counsel could vouch for nor recall, appears to confer power on a magistrate, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial, to refer the proceedings to a higher court to enable the issue of fitness to be considered. This is the qualification I mention earlier. The section appears in Part 1B Division 6 of the Commonwealth legislation. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Division 6-Unfitness to be tried. 
        
       
       
        
        20B Consequences of preliminary finding that person unfit to be tried. 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences, the question of the person's fitness to be tried in respect of the offence, is raised by the prosecution, the person or the person's legal representative, the magistrate must refer the proceedings to the court to which the proceedings would have been referred had the person been committed for trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the court to which the proceedings have been referred finds the person charged to be fit to be tried, the court must remit the proceedings to the magistrate and proceedings for the commitment must be continued as soon as practicable. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where a court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to which proceedings have been referred under subsection (1); or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) before which a person appears in proceedings for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences; finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence concerned.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Three points may be observed. First, whether the section could ever have had any real or appropriate application in the present matter is not necessary to determine. The fact is that no application was ever made to the committing magistrate in this matter. Secondly, Mr Pickin does no more than suggest that the existence of the section should be thrown into the mix on the construction point. Thirdly, while I have given consideration to Mr Pickin's argument, I do not think the section has any bearing on the construction point, essentially for the reasons I have already expressed. In those circumstances I simply put the section to one side.  
     
      
    21 I turn now to consider the question as to when the criminal proceedings in this Court commenced. This in turn takes me to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and to s 130 of the same legislation. The former section defines ""criminal proceedings"" to mean:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) proceedings relating to the trial of a person before the Supreme Court or the District Court; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) proceedings relating to the sentencing of a person by the Supreme Court or the District Court; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) proceedings relating to an appeal under the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 
         2001 to the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction.” 
        
       
      
    22 The relevant part of the latter section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “130(1) In this section, court means the Supreme Court or District Court; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the Court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury (and any orders) may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial."" 
        
       
      
    23 This section was considered by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Michael Taylor (2003) NSWCCA 194 and, more recently, in Regina v Janceski (2005) NSWCCA 281. 
     
      
    24 In the first of those cases a problem arose as to whether the new form of self-defence should go to the jury or whether the previous self-defence regime had application. This issue, in turn, depended on whether the Crimes Amendment Self-Defence Act 2001 applied to the trial or not.  
     
      
    25 The appellant, Mr Taylor, had been arraigned on 5 October 2001 on an indictment that charged him with murder. The appellant on that day entered a plea of not guilty and the trial was fixed for hearing and eventually commenced on 25 March 2002. The Crown Prosecutor presented a fresh indictment on that day. It contained the same charge as the earlier indictment, but it was differently dated and signed by a different Crown Prosecutor.  
     
      
    26 For some reason, the jury was discharged on that day and the proceedings were stood over to the following day, when again a new indictment was presented. It contained the same charge, but was dated a day later. It was signed by the same prosecutor who had signed the indictment the day before. 
     
      
    27 Between the date of the original arraignment and the trial date, the Crimes Amendment Self-Defence Act had come into force. There was a transitional provision, which provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This division applies to offences committed before or after the commencement of this division, except as provided by this section.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) This division does not apply to an offence if proceedings for the offence (other than committal proceedings) were instituted before the commencement of this division.""  
        
       
      
    28 So, the issue before the trial Judge (it was myself as it happened) was whether the proceedings for the offence had been instituted before 22 February 2002, the date when the new legislation came into force. The trial Judge found that the proceedings had been ""instituted"" on 5 October 2001.  
     
      
    29 The Court of Criminal Appeal (Bell J with whom Spigelman CJ and Miles AJ agreed) dismissed the appeal and, in particular, held that the trial Judge had been correct to hold that the new legislation had no application to the conduct of the trial. This was on the basis that the proceedings for the offence alleged against the appellant had been instituted prior to the date on which the new legislation commenced.  
     
      
    30 In the course of her judgment, Bell J addressed s 130(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. At para 150, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any event, regardless of convenience, the indictment is the originating process in criminal proceedings in the District Court and the Supreme Court and once presented may only be amended or substituted in accordance with the provisions of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    31 Later, at para 153, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 130 confers jurisdiction on the court with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment.” 
        
       
      
    32 And again at para 154 her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The institution and conduct of proceedings on indictment in this Court is governed by the provisions of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         and the Common Law, to the extent the latter is not altered by the former. It seems to me the proceedings for the offence of the murder of Adam Scott were instituted in this Court on a date no later than 5 October 2002 when the appellant entered his plea upon his arraignment before Kirby J. It was then that the appellant was deemed to have put himself on the country for trial in respect of the charge that he had murdered Adam Scott."" 
        
       
      
    33 This decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal makes it clear, and this is reinforced by the language of s 130, that criminal proceedings in this Court are commenced as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned.  
     
      
    34 Mr Pickin sought to distinguish the situation in the present matter because the section under consideration in Taylor made express reference to ""proceedings (other than committal proceedings)"" being instituted before the commencement of the division. Mr Pickin submitted that, if the transitional provision in the present matter had included a reference to committal proceedings, there would be no arguable issue. However, he argued that the present reference is general and that the available construction is accordingly a broad one. 
     
      
    35 Now, it is true that the transitional section in Taylor was in a different form than the provision under consideration in the present preliminary question. I do not consider, however, that the distinction sought to be made by Mr Pickin is a valid one. First, the reference to ""committal proceedings"" in the legislation under consideration in Taylor was, in my opinion, really no more than a statement of the obvious. It did not otherwise impinge upon the correct interpretation of the issue as to when the relevant proceedings had commenced.  
     
      
    36 Secondly, the absence of a reference to ""committal proceedings"" in the present transitional provision does not, and indeed could not, in my opinion, take the argument any further. It is clear that criminal proceedings in this Court commence upon the presentation of an indictment and the arraignment of an accused. There was, in the present matter, simply no need for the legislature to refer to ""committal proceedings"".  
     
      
    37 In Janceski Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed)referred to section 130 in the following terms at para 41: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even prior to the enactment of section 130, the District Court's jurisdiction in a criminal matter only arose upon the presentation of an indictment. That rule is now enshrined in section 130, which was enacted to overcome any doubt about the Court's ability to make pretrial orders (see  
        Jago v District Court (NSW) 
         (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 36 to 37).""  
        
       
      
    38 There is, in that case, a valuable discussion by Howie J on the same point. At para 219 his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The presentation of an indictment and the arraignment of the accused before the jury panel is a step in the proceedings that marks the commencement of the trial:  
        R v Nicolaidis 
         (1994) 33 NSWLR 362 at 367. But it serves no other purpose and I do not believe that it is a necessary step provided that there has previously been an indictment filed and provided that the accused has been arraigned on that indictment. The proceedings for trial on indictment commence upon the filing or presentation of a valid indictment. When the accused is first arraigned and pleads 'not guilty' he is 'taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial': Section 154 of the Act. Thereafter the Court has jurisdiction to make orders with respect to the conduct of the proceedings: Section 130(2) of the Act."" 
        
       
      
    39 There is also a helpful analysis by Howie J of the importance of an indictment in a criminal trial. This appears between paras 231 and 234. I have received considerable guidance from this analysis.  
     
      
    40 At para 232 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The presentation of an indictment is therefore the most fundamental of the procedures that attend a criminal trial for an indictable offence. So far as the Courts in this State are concerned, there is neither any other procedural step necessary nor any alternative step available for the commencement of a criminal trial in the District or Supreme Court.""  
        
       
      
    41 These authorities make it perfectly clear that criminal proceedings in this Court against the accused commenced on 31 May 2007 and not at any earlier time. Consequently, the new section 11 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 will apply to the question of the accused's unfitness to be tried for the offence with which he is charged. This means that the question is to be determined by a judge alone and not by a judge and jury.  
     
      
    42 I direct that the Fitness hearing proceed before me on Tuesday 25 March 2008.

Cur. adv. vult.

         

The following written judgments were delivered:—



               1989, Feb. 9
               Mason C.J. and Wilson J.
               
This appeal raises the important question whether, at common law, a court, when awarding damages for breach of contract or negligence, can include in its award damages, assessed by reference to appropriate interest rates, for the loss of the use of money which the plaintiff paid away and lost as a direct consequence of the defendant's breach of contract or negligence. There is the further question whether the presence of s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                  SA (""the Act"") inhibits any development of common law principles which would favour an affirmative answer to the primary question. The appellants would be entitled to an award of interest under s. 30c in the absence of good cause shown. However, it has not been suggested that the relevant component of the damages awarded to the appellant could be accommodated within the ambit of the power conferred by the section: but cf. Wheeler v. Page
                  
    [24]
  .


(1982) 31 S.A.S.R. 1, at p. 5.


               
The appellants, who are accountants, were the defendants in an action in the Supreme Court of South Australia brought by the respondents. The respondents carried on business under the name of Radio Electrix, selling, hiring and servicing television sets and other electronic goods. In 1982 the business was transferred to Walker Stores Pty. Ltd., that company having been incorporated to acquire and conduct thereafter the respondents' business. The appellants were engaged to prepare the partnership and individual income tax returns for the respondents for the years ended 30 June 1974 to 30 June 1981. The partnership paid the income tax of each partner out of its trading account and the amount was debited to the personal account of each partner in the books of the partnership.
               
In the partnership return for the year ended 30 June 1975 the appellants made an error in calculating the amount of depreciation allowable as a deduction. The error was carried through in the returns in succeeding years and it resulted in an overpayment of tax. Radio Electrix made provision in its books for depreciation of assets which exceeded that allowed for tax purposes. To calculate the firm's taxable income it was necessary to add to the profit shown on the firm's books the difference between the depreciation shown in the books and that allowed for taxation. The depreciation shown in the books was accumulated in a ""Provision for Depreciation"" account. In the first year for which the appellants prepared the returns the calculation of adding the difference back in was done correctly. In the second year the difference between the accumulated provision for depreciation as shown in the books and the accumulated provision for taxation as allowed for tax purposes was added back in. Consequently, the appellants' calculation of the respondents' taxable income was significantly greater than the correct amount and the respondents paid more tax than was necessary. This error was repeated each year until discovered by another accountant. The respondents were able to recover the overpaid tax for the years ending 30 June 1978, 1979 and 1980, and to amend the return for the year ending 30 June 1981, but the tax paid earlier was not recoverable as the right to recover was statute-barred.
               
The respondents sued the appellants for the loss of the amount of the income tax overpaid in the years ending 30 June 1975, 1976 and 1977, totalling $47,469.62, with compound interest at market rates upon that amount and upon the increased provisional tax which they were required to pay. As an alternative to the claims for interest, the respondents claimed damages at the trial for loss of the use of the money overpaid in these years by way of tax and paid by way of additional provisional tax. They alleged negligence and breach of contract. Bollen J. at first instance found the appellants liable for the negligent discharge of their obligations. He held that the respondents were not entitled, apart from s. 30c, to interest by way of damages. That section provides:
                     

                        
(1) Unless good cause is shown to the contrary, the court shall, upon the application of a party in favour of whom a judgment for the payment of damages, compensation or any other pecuniary amount has been, or is to be, pronounced, include in the judgment an award of interest in favour of the judgment creditor in accordance with the provisions of this section.

                        
                        
(2) The interest —
                              
(a) shall be calculated at such rate of interest as may be fixed by the court;

                              
                              
(b) shall be calculated —
                                    
(i) where the judgment is given upon an unliquidated claim — from the date of the commencement of the proceedings to the date of the judgment; or

                                    
                                    
(ii) where the judgment is given upon a liquidated claim — from the date upon which the liability to pay the amount of the claim fell due to the date of the judgment,

                                    
                                 
or in respect of such other period as may be fixed by the court; and

                              
                              
(c) shall be payable in respect of the whole or any part of the amount for which judgment is given in accordance with the determination of the court.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
(3) Where a party to any proceedings before the court is entitled to an award of interest under this section, the court may, in the exercise of its discretion, and without proceeding to calculate the interest to which that party may be entitled in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, award a lump sum in lieu of that interest.

                        
                        
(4) This section does not —
                              
(a) authorize the award of interest upon interest;

                              
                              
(ab) authorize the award of interest upon exemplary or punitive damages;

                              
                              
(b) apply in relation to any sum upon which interest is recoverable as of right by virtue of an agreement or otherwise;

                              
                              
(c) affect the damages recoverable upon the dishonour of a negotiable instrument;

                              
                              
(d) authorize the award of any interest otherwise than by consent upon any sum for which judgment is pronounced by consent; or

                              
                              
(e) limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                     

                  

               

               
Nevertheless, Bollen J. held the respondents could recover damages for the loss of the use of the overpaid amounts. In calculating those damages, he accepted ""that the [respondents] would have put most of the overpaid tax into the business"" and said:I think that had the [respondents] had the overpaid tax for their use at the times of overpayment and thereafter they could and would have used much of it to produce a profit which may fairly be assessed at 10 per cent on that money.He assessed the damages for the loss of the use of the money by reference to an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and then reduced the sum to account for the possibility that some of the money would not have been put back into the firm. Judgment against the appellants was subsequently entered as follows:
                     

                        
                           
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                    Overpaid Tax

                                    (Interest)
                                    3,062.00%B1
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    $145,378.71
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
The provisions relating to Biar's and Whitbread's work related to the ascertainment of the extent of overpayment of tax and are not relevant for purposes of this appeal.
               
The respondents challenged that award of damages in the Full Court. King C.J., with whom Millhouse and Jacobs JJ. agreed, thought that damage resulting from the loss of the use of the money was ""within the reasonable contemplation of the parties within the meaning of the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale
                     
    [25]
  
                  "" and should be included in the damages award. His Honour accepted Bollen J.'s finding that the money would have been used to pay off the loans bearing the highest interest and that some of the money might have been used in the business in other ways. Given the fact that the business was profitable, King C.J. concluded that, to the extent that the respondents would have devoted the additional funds to the business, ""their loss could not be less than the rate of interest which they were paying on the [highest interest] loans"", this rate being 20 per cent and thus substantially higher than the 10 per cent used by Bollen J. in calculating the damage suffered through the loss of the use of the money. Accordingly, King C.J. concluded:[T]he loss occasioned by the overpayments of tax, assuming that all the additional money was devoted to the business, should be measured by compound interest at [the highest interest loan's] rate on the amounts overpaid for the period during which the appellants were deprived of their use. The loss arising from loss of use of the money on that basis to 30th November 1986 would amount to $334,521.64. The loss continued to run until the date of judgment, namely 26th February 1987.King C.J. reduced that amount on the basis that it could not be inferred that all of the money would have been used in the business. His Honour thought that some of it might have been used ""for nonbusiness purposes"". His Honour adjusted downward that figure and ""estimate[d] the loss arising from loss of use of the money by reason of the overpayments at $270,000"" on the footing that the appellants' knowledge of the partnership business and of the circumstances of the partners was such that it was within the reasonable contemplation of the appellants that the loss would result from the negligent preparation of the income tax returns in question. In the result the Full Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the appellants' cross-appeal.
               
The appellants appeal to this Court against, among other things, the award of damages for the loss of the use of money assessed by reference to an annual compound interest rate of 20 per cent. The respondents seek to cross-appeal against the ruling that some of the overpaid amounts would not have been used in the business and the consequential reduction in the award of damages for the loss of the use of money. It is convenient to begin with the appellants' contentions and then to turn to the cross-appeal.
               
Before us Mr. Bennett Q.C., for the appellants, submitted that, where a purely financial loss is inflicted, damages caused by the consequential unavailability of money should not be awarded. This, he asserted, is the first time that a court has awarded damages for loss of use of money caused by a negligently inflicted loss of money. Mr. Bennett also argued that, because the legislature has intervened by enacting s. 30c, interest should not be awarded otherwise than in accordance with that provision.
               
It is certainly true to say that the common law hitherto has turned its face against awarding interest as compensation for the late payment of damages. It has been considered that the decision of the House of Lords in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.
                  
    [26]
   necessarily denied the entitlement of a plaintiff to such an award. What is meant by the expression ""late payment of damages"" in this context and whether the respondents' claim for loss of the use of money in this case is for the late payment of damages are central questions for decision.


[1893] A.C. 429.


               
This is not the occasion to trace the tortuous path by which the common law of England arrived at the position that interest will not be awarded for the late payment of damages: see Tehno-Impex v. Gebr. Van Weelde
                  
    [1]
  . However, it is necessary to mention, if only very briefly, the common law attitude towards interest before Lord Tenterden's Act 1833 
                  UK made statutory provision for the award of interest in some cases. In mediaeval times religious hostility to usury meant that the law gave little encouragement to the recovery of interest directly or by way of damages for late payment. As late as 1807 the reporter of De Havilland v. Bowerbank
                  
    [2]
   commented:It would fortunately be a very difficult matter to fix upon another point of English law, on which the authorities are so little in harmony with each other.

Lord Tenterden's decision in Page v. Newman
                  
    [3]
   confirmed the traditional rule that a creditor was not entitled to interest, in the absence of agreement, when the borrower failed to repay money lent on the due date. Lord Tenterden C.J. said
    [4]
   it would be ""productive of great inconvenience"" if a rule were adopted that ""interest is due wherever the debt has been wrongfully withheld after the plaintiff has endeavoured to obtain payment of it"" because ""it might frequently be made a question at Nisi Prius whether proper means had been used to obtain payment of the debt, and such as the party ought to have used"". His Lordship referred to ""the long-established rule"" against awards of interest in such cases.

                  Page v. Newman led to the enactment of Lord Tenterden's Act in 1833. Sections 28 and 29 of that Act qualified the common law by granting the court a discretion to award interest on ""debts or sums certain"" in certain torts and in claims upon policies of insurance.
               
It was against this background that the House of Lords decided in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. that the plaintiff could not recover an award of interest on a provisional amount payable under an agreement because there was no debt or sum certain payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time within the meaning of s. 28 of the Act of 1833. Their Lordships also decided that the plaintiff could not recover interest by way of damages for detention of the debt, the law on that subject, unsatisfactory though it was, having been too long settled to permit of departure. Although Lord Herschell L.C. considered that the ground assigned in Page v. Newman was not ""a satisfactory reason for excluding altogether any claim to interest by way of damages in cases where justice requires that it should be awarded"", he thought that the course of authority and the fact of limited legislative intervention precluded judicial review of the common law
    [5]
  . His Lordship reached this conclusion reluctantly because he thought that the rule should be:when money is owing from one party to another and that other is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order to recover the amount due to him, the party who is wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought not in justice to benefit by having that money in his possession and enjoying the use of it, when the money ought to be in the possession of the other party who is entitled to its use
    [6]
  .The decision stands for the proposition that in England, at common law, in the absence of any agreement or statutory provision for the payment of interest, a court has no power to award interest, simple or compound, as compensation for the late payment of a debt: President of India v. La Pintada Compania Navigacion S.A.
                  
    [7]
  . For a long time the decision was regarded as applying to any form of damages, including special as well as general damages.

The same view with respect to the late payment of damages was expressed in this country by Latham C.J. in his dissenting judgment in Marine Board of Launceston v. Minister for the Navy
                  
    [8]
  . His Honour said:When an action is brought for damages for breach of contract or for tort, the amount of damages is never increased (apart from some statutory provision, e.g., Lord Tenterden's Act) because there has been delay caused by negotiation and litigation or by other circumstances. The loss of the use of the money ultimately awarded as damages is not part of the loss occasioned by the tort or breach of contract itself. It is a loss due entirely to delay in the payment of money ultimately held to be due, and is not recoverable as part of the damages.See also Starke J.
    [9]
  . The majority did not address the point.

Very recently in an action for damages for negligence in failing to take reasonable care in dealing with the plaintiff's request for the arrangement of insurance cover for its ship, this Court rejected a claim by the plaintiff to include in the damages award a sum representing the loss it had suffered by being deprived of the insurance moneys since 1975:Norwest Refrigeration Services Pty. Ltd. v. Bain Dawes (W.A.) Pty. Ltd.
                  
    [10]
  . Gibbs C.J., Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ. said
    [11]
  :It [the plaintiff] argues that if the Sonoma had been covered effectively under the fleet policy then it would either have received the sum insured from the insurer in 1975 or if it became necessary to sue the insurer it would probably have received the sum insured plus interest on that sum pursuant to s. 33 of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                     WA. On this basis, Norwest claims that the interest is an integral part of the damages themselves. It is not merely a case of seeking interest on a sum assessed as the damages flowing from a tort. In our opinion, however it be put, the argument cannot succeed. At common law, no court could award interest in a case such as this, whether by way of interest on damages or as damages: London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.

In 1987 the House of Lords expressed a view similar to that taken by Latham C.J. In President of India v. Lips Maritime Corpn
                  
    [14]
   Lord Brandon of Oakbrook said:There is no such thing as a cause of action in damages for late payment of damages. The only remedy which the law affords for delay in paying damages is the discretionary award of interest pursuant to statute.It followed, in the opinion of their Lordships, that the umpire in that case was wrong when he added to the owner's claim for liquidated damages for demurrage a further damages component, though he was right to award interest (but not compound interest) on the amount of demurrage payable by the charterer as from a date being two months from the completion of discharge. Critical to the decision was the conclusion that ""a claim for demurrage sounds in damages rather than in debt""
                  
    [15]
  , even though the claim is for liquidated damages. The point is that there is a due date for payment of a debt, but no such date in the case of damages. And the parties had by their contract quantified the damages which were payable in the event of breach.

At this distance in time it seems somewhat surprising that the argument in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. made no reference to the principles enunciated in Hadley v. Baxendale governing the recovery of damages for breach of contract. The explanation no doubt lies in what in 1893 was thought to be the paramountcy of the rules relating to the recovery of interest, so that the recovery of interest stood apart from the general principles governing damages. And we need to recall that until well into the present century the common law set its face against the recovery of pure economic loss in tort. Indeed, Liesbosch, Dredger v. S.S. Edison (Owners)
                  
    [16]
   held that impecuniosity giving rise to financial loss was a separate and concurrent cause and too remote from the tort. Loss or damage due to late payment of a debt was not seen as recoverable by way of damages. Such loss or damage was regarded as too remote.


[1933] A.C. 449, at p. 460.


               
It was not until 1952 that it was recognized that loss due to the late payment of a debt or damages might be recoverable in accordance with Hadley v. Baxendale. It was then acknowledged that loss of this kind might constitute special damage within the contemplation of the parties under the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale. In Trans Trust S.P.R.L. v. Danubian Trading Co. Ltd.
                  
    [17]
   the Court of Appeal recognized that a failure to pay money would give rise to an entitlement to damages for breach of contract if a special loss was foreseeable at the time of the contract as the consequence of non-payment. Denning L.J. asserted
    [18]
   that the ground on which the law refused interest for late payment of a debt or damages was that interest was ""
                     ""generally presumed not to be within the contemplation of the parties"": see Bullen & Leake, 3rd ed., at p. 51""
                  
    [18]
  . Denning L.J. went on to say: ""That is, I think, the only real ground on which damages can be refused for non-payment of money. It is because the consequences are as a rule too remote.""

Subsequently in Wadsworth v. Lydall
                  
    [19]
   the Court of Appeal, applying what had been said in Trans Trust S.P.R.L., held that a plaintiff was entitled to recover as special damages the loss suffered by him as the result of the failure of the defendant to pay a sum of £10,000 due to him under a contract, the circumstances being that the defendant ought to have known that the plaintiff would need to acquire another farm or smallholding, using the £10,000 payable under the contract for the purpose, and that if the £10,000 was not paid the plaintiff would be compelled to incur expense in arranging alternative finance and paying interest. The Court of Appeal distinguished London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. on the ground that it was concerned with the first, but not the second, limb in Hadley v. Baxendale. Brightman L.J. said
    [20]
   of the action in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.:The action was an action for an account. The House was concerned only with a claim for interest by way of general damages. If a plaintiff pleads and can prove that he has suffered special damage as a result of the defendant's failure to perform his obligation under a contract, and such damage is not too remote on the principle of Hadley v. Baxendale
                     
    [21]
  , I can see no logical reason why such special damage should be irrecoverable merely because the obligation on which the defendant defaulted was an obligation to pay money and not some other type of obligation.

In La Pintada
                  
    [22]
   the House of Lords approved Wadsworth v. Lydall and the distinction drawn by Brightman L.J. between that case and London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. The House of Lords, though acknowledging the injustices caused by the old common law rule as confirmed by its 1893 decision, concluded that it could not depart from that decision. This was because Parliament had chosen to remedy some of those injustices in certain circumstances and because the rule had been judicially qualified by limiting its application to claims for general, as opposed to special, damages

  .

In confining the authority of its earlier decision, the House of Lords opened the way to a logical and principled development of the law of damages on the topic now under consideration. The means by which this initiative was achieved — asserting that the 1893 decision was concerned only with the first limb in Hadley v. Baxendale
                  
    [24]
   — enabled the House of Lords to escape from the rigours of stare decisis. London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.
                  
    [25]
   does not confront us quite so starkly, but Norwest Refrigeration
                  
    [26]
   presents a similar problem, with which we shall deal in due course.

However, for the moment, it is necessary to examine the distinction made by the House of Lords along with the consequence that the distinction entails. In the first place, the distinction is a gloss on London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. which proceeded on the broad footing that interest by way of damages was too remote, without discriminating between the refinements of Hadley v. Baxendale of which no mention was made. Secondly, and more importantly, the circumstances which are now held to attract the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale — take, for example, those in Wadsworth v. Lydall — are very often circumstances which in any event would attract the first limb. If a plaintiff sustains loss or damage in relation to money which he has paid out or forgone, why is he not entitled to recover damages for loss of the use of money when the loss or damage sustained was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the relevant breach of contract or tort? After all, that is the fundamental rule governing the recovery of damages, according to the first limb in Hadley v. Baxendale Ltd. (see Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Industries Ltd.
                  
    [27]
  ) and, subject to proximity, in negligence. The object of the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale was to include loss arising from special circumstances of which the defendant had actual knowledge when that loss does not fall within the first limb because it does not arise from ""the ordinary course of things"" of which the defendant has imputed knowledge: see Victoria Laundry
                  
    [27]
  . To allow a plaintiff to recover special, but not general, damages, is illogical, subverts the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale from its intended purpose and introduces a new element into the general measure of damages for negligence.


[1949] 2 K.B. 528, at p. 539.
[1949] 2 K.B. 528, at p. 539.


               
If the distinction between the two limbs is to be rigorously applied in claims for damages for loss of the use of money, a plaintiff who actually incurs the expense of interest on borrowed money to replace money paid away or withheld from him will be entitled to recover that cost, so long as the defendant was aware of the special circumstances, but not otherwise. The expense must fall within the second limb of Hadley v. Baxendale in order to be compensable. It cannot fall within the first limb because the defendant cannot be fixed with imputed knowledge of the plaintiff's financial situation and of his need to incur expense by borrowing money. Furthermore, a plaintiff who is not compelled to borrow money by way of replacement of money paid away or withheld will not be entitled to recover for the opportunity lost to him, i.e., lost opportunity to invest or to maintain an investment. This is because in the ordinary course of things the defendant appreciates that the plaintiff will replace from his other resources the money lost, so that opportunity cost falls more readily within the first limb of Hadley v. Baxendale. How can this difference in treatment be justified? In each case the plaintiff sustains a loss and, ex hypothesi, the defendant's wrongful act or omission is the effective cause of that loss, at least if we put Liesbosch, Dredger
                  
    [28]
   to one side.


[1933] A.C. 449.


               
In Canada it seems that a plaintiff is entitled to recover interest charges actually incurred on money borrowed on the defendant's default or if the plaintiff owes money to anyone equal to the amount of the claim and is paying interest on it: Waddams, Law of Damages (1983), §833; and see Atlantic Salvage Ltd. v. City of Halifax
                  
    [29]
   where the plaintiff's claim for interest succeeded on the ground that it had been indebted to its bank for a sum exceeding the amount of the claim throughout the period. But it has been acknowledged that it is anomalous to allow interest only to a plaintiff who has an overdraft: Municipal Spraying & Contracting Ltd. v. J. Harris & Sons Ltd.
                  
    [30]
  . If a justification exists for the difference in treatment, it must have its genesis in a policy that encourages recovery of expense actually incurred and discourages or denies recovery of opportunity cost. Yet it is not easy to see any cogent reason for the adoption of such a policy; the award of compensation for opportunity cost would not expose the courts to insuperable problems in fact-finding.


(1978) 94 D.L.R. (3d) 513.
(1979) 35 N.S.R. (2d) 237.


               
Indeed, such a policy would be at odds with the fundamental principle that a plaintiff is entitled to restitutio in integrum. According to that principle, the plaintiff is entitled to full compensation for the loss which he sustains in consequence of the defendant's wrong, subject to the rules as to remoteness of damage and to the plaintiff's duty to mitigate his loss. In principle he should be awarded the compensation which would restore him to the position he would have been in but for the defendant's breach of contract or negligence. Judged from a commercial viewpoint, the plaintiff sustains an economic loss if his damages are not paid promptly, just as he sustains such a loss when his debt is not paid on the due date. The loss may arise in the form of the investment cost of being deprived of money which could have been invested at interest or used to reduce an existing indebtedness. Or the loss may arise in the form of the borrowing cost, i.e., interest payable on borrowed money or interest foregone because an existing investment is realized or reduced.
               
The requirement of foreseeability is no obstacle to the award of damages, calculated by reference to the appropriate interest rates, for loss of the use of money. Opportunity cost, more so than incurred expense, is a plainly foreseeable loss because, according to common understanding, it represents the market price of obtaining money. But, even in the case of incurred expense, it is at least strongly arguable that a plaintiff's loss or damage represented by this expense is not too remote on the score of foreseeability. In truth, it is an expense which represents loss or damage flowing naturally and directly from the defendant's wrongful act or omission, particularly when that act or omission results in the withholding of money from a plaintiff or causes the plaintiff to pay away money.
               
The truism that there is no cause of action for the late payment of damages is sometimes proffered as a justification for not compensating loss by way of incurred expense and opportunity cost for money paid away or withheld. True, a defendant commits no tort by contesting the plaintiff's claim for damages or for that matter by contesting the plaintiff's claim to recover a debt. But the problem is not concerned with finding a cause of action; rather it is a problem of defining the limits of recoverable damages for an established cause of action. The argument for denying the recovery of incurred expense and opportunity cost in the sense already discussed rests on the more limited proposition that a plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for late payment of damages otherwise than in the form of interest in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. As a matter of logic and principle, as well as commercial reality, this proposition has little to commend it in the circumstances of the present case.
               
Incurred expense and opportunity cost arising from paying money away or the withholding of moneys due to the defendant's wrong are something more than the late payment of damages. They are pecuniary losses suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's wrong and therefore constitute an integral element of the loss for which he is entitled to be compensated by an award of damages. Fitzgerald J. made this very point in Sanrod v. Dainford
                  
    [31]
   when he said:[W]hatever may be the position otherwise in respect of damages under the [Trade Practices] Act, I can myself perceive no difficulty in accepting that, when money is paid in consequence of misleading conduct, the loss suffered by that conduct includes not only the money paid but also the cost of borrowing that money or the loss from its investment, as the case may be: cf. Frith v. Gold Coast Mineral Springs Pty. Ltd.
                     
    [32]
  ; affirmed
    [33]
  . Interest awarded as a component of damages in such circumstances is not for loss of the use of the money awarded as damages, but for loss of the use of the money paid over in consequence of the misleading conduct and is directly related to the misleading conduct.Notwithstanding that these remarks were made in relation to the payment of money in consequence of misleading conduct, the underlying principle is one of wider application. The point is that the loss of the use of the money paid away is so directly related to the wrong that the loss cannot be classified simply as due to the late payment of damages: see also General Securities Ltd. v. Don Ingram Ltd.
                  
    [34]
   (the plaintiff recovered a business loss incurred as a borrower in consequence of the lender's breach of obligation to advance the money) and Pelletier v. Pe Ben Industries Co. Ltd.
                  
    [35]
   (damages awarded on a contract to purchase a truck in consequence of the defendant's wrongful dismissal of the plaintiff from his employment). These cases proceed on the proposition that the cost of borrowing money to avoid a loss caused by a breach of contract is recoverable and not too remote.

[1976] 6 W.W.R. 640.


               
Authority provides scant instruction on the ambit of the principle that at common law compensation is not awarded for the late payment of damages. The notion, if not the principle, is perhaps best illustrated by the comments of Dr. Lushington in The Amalia
                  
    [36]
  . There the question arose whether the party who had negligently caused a maritime collision resulting in the total loss of a Belgian ship was liable in admiralty to pay interest on the damages awarded. The report states that Dr. Lushington, after pointing out that restitutio in integrum applied, as it did at common law, entitling the party aggrieved to a full indemnity, observed that:Interest was not given by reason of indemnification for the loss, for the loss was the damage which had accrued, but interest was given for this reason, namely, that the loss was not paid at the proper time. If a man is kept out of his money, it is a loss in the common sense of the word, but a loss of a totally different description and clearly to be distinguished from a loss which has occurred by damage done at the moment of a collision. The principle, therefore, which the Registrar and merchants had acted upon was that just stated: viz., to give interest from the time when the loss ought to have been paid for. Thus Lord Stowell expressly stated in the case of The Dundee
                     
    [37]
  , that he gave interest beyond the value of the damaged ship by reason of detention of payment and not by way of damages. To that principle his Lordship entirely acceded.The loss, though too remote at common law, was compensable in admiralty. And the loss of which Dr. Lushington was speaking was a loss which was due exclusively to the late payment of damages.

The cost of borrowing money to replace money paid away or withheld, in consequence of the defendant's breach of contract or negligence, is directly related to the wrong and is not too remote in the sense in which the common law regarded the loss attributable to late payment of damages as being too remote. We reach this conclusion more readily, knowing that legal and economic thinking about the remoteness of financial and economic loss have developed markedly in recent times. Likewise, opportunity cost should not be considered as being too remote when money is paid away or withheld.
               
Once it is accepted that the cost of borrowing money to replace money paid away or withheld is not too remote, it is pointless to insist on a distinction between the award of damages for loss of the use of money in the case of a liquidated claim and the award of such interest in an unliquidated claim. The award of damages in accordance with Hadley v. Baxendale is unrelated to, and free from, any requirement that there is, or should be, any ""wrongful"" withholding of money, be it a debt or damages.
               
There can be no objection to the recovery of the cost of borrowing as consequential loss by reference to the notion that the loss is one which arises after the plaintiff's cause of action accrues or becomes complete. Such a notion is by no means an absolute bar to recovery for loss arising after that date. It was acknowledged by this Court in Johnson v. Perez
                  
    [38]
   that the rule that damages for breach of contract or tort are assessed at the date of breach or when the cause of action arises is not universal. Wenham v. Ella
                  
    [39]
   is a striking illustration of a plaintiff recovering loss which accrued after his cause of action became complete. There the plaintiff recovered damages for the loss of income he sustained by reason of the defendant's breach of contract for refusing to transfer income-producing land pursuant to the contract between the parties, the loss being within the contemplation of the parties
    [40]
  . In that case the Court took account of the fact that the plaintiff had paid the entire consideration payable by him as purchaser and of the fact that the defendant had had the use of the plaintiff's money. Menzies J. noted
    [41]
  :In the interval between the breach and judgment, the purchaser would be out of pocket, and the vendor in pocket, by the amount of the return from the land.The significance of the decision is that by reason of the breach the plaintiff lost income after breach and damages were awarded for that head of loss. Gibbs J. observed that it was immaterial whether the damages came within the first or second limb of Hadley v. Baxendale 
                  ""or indeed whether both are applicable""
                  
    [42]
  . There was no suggestion that the plaintiff's loss was to be attributed to the late payment of damages.

We turn now to examine the distinction made in Lips Maritime
                  
    [43]
   between a claim for interest on a debt and a claim for interest on damages. Properly understood the plaintiff's claim in Lips Maritime
                  
    [43]
   was for interest by way of damages for the late payment of damages and as such the claim failed. The demurrage clause liquidated exchange losses according to a stipulated formula. The plaintiff sought interest on the unpaid liquidated losses. A claim for interest on unpaid liquidated losses or damages is of necessity a claim for late payment of damages and one which goes beyond the measure of damages agreed between the parties. Accordingly Lips Maritime
                  
    [43]
   is not inconsistent with the award of damages assessed by reference to appropriate interest rates as a component or head of loss in the assessment of a plaintiff's damages.

                  Norwest Refrigeration
                  
    [44]
   presents a different problem. The remarks in the joint judgment about the non-award of damages by way of interest at common law were obiter. The plaintiff's claim for interest was based on the statutory provisions, which had been amended during the course of the litigation, not on the common law. Moreover, no reference was made in argument to Trans Trust or to Wadsworth v. Lydall and the decision antedated La Pintada and Lips Maritime. Furthermore, Norwest Refrigeration did not involve a claim for damages for the loss of the use of money paid away or withheld as a result of breach of contract or negligence. For these reasons it is not an obstacle to an award of interest in favour of the respondents.


(1984) 157 C.L.R. 149.


               
There remains for consideration the argument, reflecting what was said in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. and La Pintada, that legislative intervention in the form of s. 30c precludes further development of common law principle. We see no reason for construing s. 30c in such a way that it forecloses the authority of the courts to award damages in accordance with the principle established by Hadley v. Baxendale and the measure of damages governing claims in tort. The section is not intended to erect a comprehensive and exclusive code governing the award of interest. It is a provision intended to provide a plaintiff with some protection against the late payment of damages. The section does not attempt to regulate the measure of compensation to be awarded for a specific head of loss. The provisions of s. 30c(4)(b) and (e) expressly recognize that interest may be recoverable at common law quite apart from the statute.
               
Sub-section (4)(e) states that s. 30c ""does not limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest"" (our emphasis). It would be a strange result if, in the face of this provision, the Court were to hold that the enactment of s. 30c precluded the award of damages for loss of the use of money, in accordance with the logical development of fundamental common law principle so as to accord with commercial reality, to a plaintiff deprived of the use of money paid away or withheld as the result of the defendant's negligence or breach of contract. Where a legislative provision is designed to repair the failings of the common law and is not intended to be a comprehensive code, the existence of that provision is not a reason for this Court refusing to give effect to the logical development of common law principle. It would be ironic if a legislative attempt to correct defects in the common law resulted in other flaws becoming ossified in the common law.
               
Equity has adopted a broad approach to the award of interest. It has long been accepted that the equitable right to interest exists independently of statute: Wallersteiner v. Moir [No. 2]
                  
    [45]
  . Equity courts have regularly awarded interest, including not only simple interest but also compound interest, when justice so demanded, e.g., money obtained and retained by fraud and money withheld or misapplied by a trustee or fiduciary: La Pintada
                  
    [46]
  . In admiralty, simple interest has been awarded in a variety of cases standing outside the authority conferred by statute. As Sir Robert Phillimore said in The Northumbria
                  
    [47]
  :The principle adopted by the Admiralty Court has been that of the civil law, that interest was always due to the obligee when payment was not made, ex mora of the obligor; and that, whether the obligation arose ex contractu or ex delicto.See also La Pintada

Likewise in Scotland the courts followed the civil law. The principle is that interest is awarded, as of right, whenever a principal sum of money was ""withheld, and not paid on the day when it ought to have been paid"", in the words of Lord Westbury in Carmichael v. Caledonian Railway Co.
                  
    [49]
  ; Riches v. Westminster Bank Ltd.

  . This principle, like that applied in admiralty, was the one favoured but not adopted by Lord Herschell in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.
                  
    [51]
  . However, the Scottish courts drew a distinction between debt and damages. They awarded interest on a debt from the date of service of the summons and interest on damages only from the date of the judgment. It was only then that the sum was quantified: see the discussion in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Lord Denning M.R., in Jefford v. Gee

Although the admiralty model has obvious attractions, the common law has steadfastly declined over a very long time to adopt the admiralty approach in awarding compensation for late payment of damages in the general run of cases. But we see no reason for allowing the reluctance of the common law to extend to cases where the defendant's breach of contract or negligence has caused the plaintiff to pay away or the defendant to withhold money and, as a result, the plaintiff has been deprived of the use of the money so paid away or withheld. The recovery of compensation for the loss may be ascribed to the operation of the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale
                  
    [54]
  . However, we would prefer to put it on the footing that it is a foreseeable loss, necessarily within the contemplation of the parties, which is directly related to the defendant's breach of contract or tort.


(1854) 9 Ex. 341 [156 E.R. 145].


               
On this footing the Full Court was correct in awarding damages for the added cost of funding the business with borrowed money as a result of the loss of the use of money overpaid in tax. The award of interest was of necessity compound interest. Simple interest would not reflect accurately the extent of the respondents' loss. Simple interest almost always undercompensates the injured party's true loss. Bowles and Whelan, Judgment Awards and Simple Interest Rates, International Review of Law and Economics, vol. 1 (1981) 111, at p. 112 observe:If the plaintiff was expecting payment for a consignment of goods, but did not receive his money, the extent of his loss could be measured approximately by the amount of income that he could otherwise have generated simply by putting the proceeds into a deposit account at a bank. Such a move would attract compound interest, since the bank would automatically add to the account any interest generated. Equally, a plaintiff in a tort action can be thought of as incurring opportunity costs best measured by compound rather than simple rates. Had he received his award immediately upon the damage occurring, it may be assumed that he would have invested it at compound rates in just the same way as would the plaintiff who is suffering from a breach of contract.The disdain of the common law for interest, especially compound interest, is a ""relic from the days when interest was regarded as necessarily usurious"" (Ogus, Law of Damages (1973), p. 98).
               
The Full Court in the present matter concluded that the damage sustained by the respondents resulting from the loss of the use of money was ""within the reasonable contemplation of the parties"" and should therefore be part of the basis on which damages are assessed. It found that had the respondents had the money they would have used it to pay off their most expensive loans or, if the return on the money would have been greater if put into the business, they would have taken that course. Consequently, the Court ascertained the value of the injury arising from the loss of the use of the money, as a minimum, at the rate of the most expensive loans which was 20 per cent and then reduced the resulting figure by 20 per cent in order to accommodate the finding of the trial judge that not all the money wrongly paid away would have been applied in reduction of those loans.
               
Both the appellants and the respondents challenged this approach to the assessment of the respondents' damages. The appellants contended that the Full Court erred in failing to take into account the incorporation of the partnership business in 1982 and that the adoption of 20 per cent interest as the basis of the calculation was unsupported by the evidence and wrong. The consequence of incorporation, so it was argued, was that any loss thereafter was sustained by the company, not the partnership. But, in reality, the incorporation of the company did not put an end to the losses being suffered by the respondents. They individually were required to pay the tax and it was paid on their behalf by the partnership. Their accounts with the partnership were debited so that they individually were the persons deprived of the use of the money thus paid away. They were still without the money which, had they enjoyed the use of it, subject to the findings of fact already mentioned, would have been invested with the company. But whether it would have been lent at interest or used as share capital so as to generate greater profit for distribution by way of dividends to the respondents and the members of their families (as owners of the company) is a matter of speculation. It may not follow that the extent of the respondents' loss after the company took over the business is to be measured by reference to the company's most expensive loans. It might be more appropriate to measure the loss on the basis of opportunity cost by reference to current market rates of interest.
               
For their part the respondents seek special leave to cross-appeal in order to challenge the finding by Bollen J. that some of the lost money would not have been used to pay off the loans or have been invested in the business. The respondents contend that the finding of fact was unsupported by the evidence. However, the finding was endorsed by the Full Court. King C.J. said:While there is every reason to suppose that most of the money would have been devoted to the business, there are insufficient grounds for finding that all of it would have been so used. I think that a fair calculation of the [respondents'] loss must take into account the possibility that part of the money would, if available, have been used for non-business purposes  There is no firm basis for arriving at the amount of the adjustment. It is a matter of judgment on the sparse material available.In the light of these observations, the Chief Justice adopted a broad-brush approach and adjusted downward the amount assessed for the loss of the use of the money. It might be said that the finding of fact would not necessarily exclude the prospect of the respondents recovering damages on the basis of opportunity cost.
               
Consideration of these arguments of the appellants and the respondents respectively, with respect to the approach taken by the Full Court to the actual ascertainment of damages, leads us to the view that this Court should not entertain them. As King C.J. pointed out, the materials are sparse. They do not provide a suitable vehicle for the determination of any point of general principle. What is more we do not consider that the appellants' argument about ""lifting the corporate veil"" does raise a question of general principle. Rather, as it seems to us, the argument calls for an examination, based on facts and inferences arising from inadequate materials, directed to the ascertainment of the loss suffered personally by the respondents. In these circumstances the preferable course is to refuse special leave to cross-appeal and to exclude from the appeal the arguments based on the incorporation of the company.
               
Accordingly, we would vary the grant of special leave to appeal by confining it in the manner indicated, dismiss the appeal, and refuse special leave to cross-appeal.
            


               
Brennan and Deane JJ.
               
We agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and Wilson J. and are in general agreement with the reasons given by their Honours for those orders.
               
There is, in our view, a critical distinction between an order that interest be paid upon an award of damages and an actual award of damages which represents compensation for a wrongfully caused loss of the use of money and which is assessed wholly or partly by reference to the interest which would have been earned by safe investment of the money or which was in fact paid upon borrowings which otherwise would have been unnecessary or retired. On the one hand, there is no common law power to make an order for the payment of interest to compensate for the delay in obtaining payment of what the court assesses to be the appropriate measure of damages for a wrongful act. If such interest is to be awarded at common law, it must be pursuant to statutory authority. On the other hand, there is no acceptable reason why the ordinary principles governing the recovery of common law damages should not, in an appropriate case, apply to entitle a plaintiff to an actual award of damages as compensation for a wrongfully and foreseeably caused loss of the use of money. To the extent that the reported cases support the proposition that damages cannot be awarded as compensation for the loss of the use of a specific sum of money which the wrongful act of a defendant has caused to be paid away or withheld, they are contrary to principle and commercial reality and should not be followed.
               
In the present case, the breach of the duty of care which the appellants owed to the respondents caused overpayments of tax by the respondents. The direct and foreseeable effect of those overpayments was that specific sums of money (i.e. the amounts of the overpayments), which would otherwise have been available to avoid, repay or offset the costs of some of the significant borrowings of the respondents' business, were unavailable to the respondents from the time of the respective overpayments. The injury sustained by the respondents by reason of the loss of the use of the amounts of the overpayments was as foreseeably caused by the breach of the appellants' duty of care as would have been the case if the appellants had wrongfully deprived the respondents of the use of their money by locking it in a foolproof safe and withholding the key. The quantum of damages which represents appropriate compensation for that loss plainly fell to be assessed by reference to (among other things) the rates of interest paid by the respondents upon borrowings which would probably have been avoided, retired or offset but for the overpayments.
            


               
Dawson J.
               
In 1973 the first three respondents, who are brothers, and the fourth respondent, who is the wife of the first of them, began to carry on a business at Murray Bridge in South Australia under the name of Radio Electrix. The business was that of selling, hiring, and servicing television sets and other electrical appliances. The business was acquired through the brothers' father, who was the managing director of a similar business carried on under the name of Radio Rentals. The Murray Bridge business was a branch of Radio Rentals before it was purchased by the first four respondents. Of the remaining two respondents, the fifth is the mother of the first three respondents and the sixth is the wife of the second respondent. They subsequently became partners in Radio Electrix.
               
The appellants are three firms of accountants which were, in effect, the one continuing firm differently constituted from time to time. It is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to differentiate between the appellants. Nor is it necessary to have regard to the differing interests of the respondents in the partnership since they were content to have any judgment made jointly in their favour. It is therefore possible to proceed for convenience upon the basis that there was one cause of action rather than a separate cause in the case of each partner. I should perhaps add at this point that Radio Electrix was incorporated in 1982, the business being carried on thereafter by Walker Stores Pty. Ltd. It will be necessary to refer later to this circumstance.
               
The appellants acted as accountants for Radio Rentals and when the Murray Bridge branch was acquired by the partnership they were engaged by the partnership. One of the functions of the appellants as accountants for the partnership was to prepare its income tax returns and those of the individual partners. This they did each year until 1981. The partnership paid the income tax of each partner in those years out of its trading account and the amount was then debited to the personal account of the partner.
               
In the partnership return for the year ended 30 June 1975 an error was made in the calculation of depreciation as an allowable deduction. Radio Electrix made provision in its own books for the depreciation of assets which was greater than that allowed for taxation purposes. This made it necessary to adjust the profit shown in the partnership books in order to obtain a figure for tax purposes by adding to it the difference between the depreciation calculated for partnership purposes and the depreciation allowed for taxation purposes. This was done correctly on the first occasion in 1974 but in 1975 what was added back was not the difference between the depreciation shown in the books for that year and the depreciation allowed for taxation purposes but the difference between the accumulated provision for depreciation shown in the books and the accumulated provision for depreciation allowed for taxation purposes. The result was that the partnership profit, and the taxable income of each of the partners, were shown in their returns to be greater than they in fact were. The error was repeated in each year thereafter until it was discovered by another accountant engaged by the respondents to advise them upon the incorporation of the business. The respondents were able to amend the relevant returns for the year ended 30 June 1981 and to recover from the Commissioner of Taxation the amounts of tax overpaid for the three preceding years, but they were barred from recovering the amounts overpaid in the years ending 30 June 1975, 1976 and 1977.
               
The respondents commenced an action for damages against the appellants to recover the income tax overpaid in those years which, in total, came to $47,469.62. They also claimed compound interest at market rates upon the amount overpaid and upon the increased provisional tax which they were required to pay. The respondents alleged that their losses were caused by the appellants' negligence, either in breach of contract or in breach of a duty of care in tort.
               
At trial, a claim, expressed as an alternative to the claim for interest, was made for loss of the use of the money overpaid by way of tax and paid as additional provisional tax. The trial judge, Bollen J., took the view that the law does not permit interest to be awarded as damages, but upheld the alternative claim for loss of use of money. He accepted evidence given by the respondents that they would have put most of the money overpaid back into the partnership business and concluded that had the respondents ""had the overpaid tax for their use at the times of overpayment and thereafter they could and would have used much of it to produce a profit which may fairly be assessed at 10% on that money."" Upon the basis of simple interest at ten per cent per annum, the trial judge calculated the relevant amounts due to the respondents as at 30 November 1986, as follows:
                     

                        
                           
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                    Overpaid tax
                                    $47,469.62
                                 
                                 
                                    Loss of use of money
                                    $67,858.53
                                 
                                 
                                    Loss of use in relation to payment of excess provisional tax
                                    $16,044.60
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
He recognized the need for additional calculation in relation to the period between 30 November 1986 and the date of judgment and concluded with the following observation:No doubt it rather looks as if I have allowed interest as a component of damages but at a lesser rate than sought by the plaintiffs. I have not. I have assessed loss caused by loss of use of money which the plaintiffs should have had. In assessing I have used 10% on that money as a guide, considered and rejected ""deduction"" for contingencies and thus stumbled to a result.
               

               
The respondents appealed to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia against the award of damages made by the trial judge. The appellants cross-appealed. The Full Court, King C.J., Jacobs and Millhouse JJ., upheld the appeal. The Chief Justice, with whom Jacobs and Millhouse JJ. agreed, reached the conclusion that:
                      the loss occasioned by the overpayments of tax, assuming that all the additional money was devoted to the business, should be measured by compound interest on the amounts overpaid for the period during which the appellants were deprived of their use. The loss arising from loss of use of the money on that basis to 30th November 1986 would amount to $334,521.64. The loss continued to run until the date of judgment, namely 26th February 1987.
               

               
The rate of interest selected by the Chief Justice was that charged by Mutual Acceptance (Finance) Ltd., a company to which the partnership owed substantial funds during the relevant period. That rate was the highest paid by the respondents for borrowed funds and was in excess of 20 per cent per annum. Allowing for the possibility that some of the additional money may not have been put back into the business if it had been available and recognizing that the loss of the use of the money continued to the date of judgment, the Chief Justice estimated ""the loss arising from loss of use of the money by reason of the overpayments at $270,000"". This amount was held to be payable by the appellants upon the basis that the appellants' knowledge of the partnership business and the circumstances of the partners were such that it was reasonably within their contemplation that such a loss would result from the negligent preparation of the relevant income tax returns. Accordingly the Full Court allowed the appeal, dismissed the cross-appeal and increased the amount of the judgment. The appellants now appeal from the decision of the Full Court and the respondents cross-appeal upon the basis that the amount allowed for the loss of use of money ought to have been calculated upon the full amount of the tax and provisional tax overpaid. The critical question is whether the respondents were entitled to any award in their favour by way of damages for the loss of the use of the money paid in error to the Commissioner of Taxation.
               
Bollen J. sought to draw a distinction between damages for the loss of use of money and interest upon the money lost, but it is a distinction without a difference in the present context. Interest is merely a method of calculating the cost of money and it could in this case, statutory interest apart, only be recovered by the respondents by way of damages: see Williston, Law of Contracts, 3rd ed. (1968), vol. 11, ¶1412.
               
In dealing with the question of the respondents' entitlement to damages in the form of interest on the money paid away, it is essential to identify at the outset the nature of the obligation for the breach of which the respondents have claimed damages. Whether arising from contract or tort that obligation consisted of a duty on the part of the appellants to take care: a duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence in the practice of their profession. The appellants do not now question that they were in breach of this duty in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 and that the loss incurred by the respondents in each of those years because of the overpayment of tax and the payment of additional provisional tax was the result of their negligence. Upon each occasion on which overpayment occurred in the relevant years the respondents suffered a wrong for which they now sue and the cause of action for each wrong, whether it be regarded as a breach of contract or a tort, was complete at the time of overpayment. Any further loss caused by the failure to meet the liability to which the cause of action gave rise must, if it is recoverable at all, be recoverable upon some basis other than as part of the cause of action constituted by the negligence of the appellants.
               
The respondents sue for damages for negligence, not for debt. In other words, they sue for compensation for the breach of a duty of care and not to recover a sum of money due and payable. The failure to pay a debt may entail loss in addition to the amount of the debt as a result of the breach of the same obligation as gives rise to the debt itself. Whether or not such further loss is recoverable depends upon whether it is sufficiently foreseeable and therefore not too remote. On the other hand, when, as is ordinarily the case having regard to the course of litigation, damages are not immediately recoverable and additional compensation is sought for the delay, what is claimed are damages for the non-payment of damages, a remedy which the law does not recognize. This is the distinction which was drawn by Latham C.J. (in dissent but not upon this point) in Marine Board of Launceston v. Minister for the Navy
                  
    [55]
   when he said:When an action is brought for damages for breach of contract or for tort, the amount of damages is never increased (apart from some statutory provision, e.g. Lord Tenterden's Act) because there has been delay caused by negotiation and litigation or by other circumstances. The loss of the use of the money ultimately awarded as damages is not part of the loss occasioned by the tort or breach of contract itself. It is a loss due entirely to delay in the payment of money ultimately held to be due, and is not recoverable as part of the damages.And in Norwest Refrigeration Services Pty. Ltd. v. Bain Dawes (W.A.) Pty. Ltd.
                  
    [56]
   Gibbs C.J., Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ. in a joint judgment drew the same distinction in a case in which the plaintiff sought to recover, in addition to damages for negligence on the part of the defendant in failing to effect insurance cover over its fishing vessel, an amount representing the loss which it suffered by being deprived of the insurance moneys. The majority observed
    [57]
  :It [the plaintiff] argues that if the Sonoma had been covered effectively under the fleet policy then it would either have received the sum insured from the insurer in 1975 or if it became necessary to sue the insurer it would probably have received the sum insured plus interest on that sum pursuant to s. 33 of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                     WA. On this basis, Norwest claims that the interest is an integral part of the damages themselves. It is not merely a case of seeking interest on a sum assessed as the damages flowing from a tort. In our opinion, however it be put, the argument cannot succeed. At common law, no court could award interest in a case such as this, whether by way of interest on damages or as damages: London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.

These observations do not pass judgment upon the justice of the situation. Indeed, the injustice of requiring a plaintiff always to bear the whole cost of delay attendant upon the commencement and prosecution of litigation has now been recognized by legislation in most jurisdictions in a somewhat more generous way than the legislation referred to by Latham C.J. in the passage above. In South Australia the relevant provision is s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                  SA which is as follows:
                     

                        
(1) Unless good cause is shown to the contrary, the court shall, upon the application of a party in favour of whom a judgment for the payment of damages, compensation or any other pecuniary amount has been, or is to be, pronounced, include in the judgment an award of interest in favour of the judgment creditor in accordance with the provisions of this section.

                        
                        
(2) The interest —
                              
(a) shall be calculated at such rate of interest as may be fixed by the court;

                              
                              
(b) shall be calculated —
                                    
(i) where the judgment is given upon an unliquidated claim — from the date of the commencement of the proceedings to the date of the judgment; or

                                    
                                    
(ii) where the judgment is given upon a liquidated claim — from the date upon which the liability to pay the amount of the claim fell due to the date of the judgment,

                                    
                                 
or in respect of such other period as may be fixed by the court; and

                              
                              
(c) shall be payable in respect of the whole or any part of the amount for which judgment is given in accordance with the determination of the court.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
(3) Where a party to any proceedings before the court is entitled to an award of interest under this section, the court may, in the exercise of its discretion, and without proceeding to calculate the interest to which that party may be entitled in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, award a lump sum in lieu of that interest.

                        
                        
(4) This section does not —
                              
(a) authorize the award of interest upon interest;

                              
                              
(ab) authorize the award of interest upon exemplary or punitive damages;

                              
                              
(b) apply in relation to any sum upon which interest is recoverable as of right by virtue of an agreement or otherwise;

                              
                              
(c) affect the damages recoverable upon the dishonour of a negotiable instrument;

                              
                              
(d) authorize the award of any interest otherwise than by consent upon any sum for which judgment is pronounced by consent; or

                              
                              
(e) limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest.

                  UK, s. 35A. But the statutory provision for interest, limited as it is, does not create a cause of action where none existed and, indeed, underlines its absence by the very provision which it makes.
               
The legislation applies in the case of a judgment for a sum of money, whether sounding in debt or in damages. But the difference between debt and damages is crucial in any examination of the position at common law. In cases of debt the obligation upon the part of the debtor is to pay a sum of money and if the creditor suffers any loss in addition to the sum owed, by reason of the failure of the debtor to pay on time, that loss flows from the breach of that obligation, which constitutes the cause of action. Recoverability is limited only by the question of the remoteness of the loss. With damages, the obligation giving rise to the cause of action is different. Taking this case, the obligation on the part of the appellants was to exercise reasonable skill and care in the preparation of the respondents' income tax returns. Any loss suffered by the respondents as a result of the breach of that obligation was payable by way of damages but any delay in the payment of those damages constituted no breach of the obligation to exercise due skill and care. No question of remoteness arises because the loss due to delay in the payment of damages does not flow from the breach, that is to say, forms no part of the respondents' cause of action.
               
Even in cases of debt, the courts have adopted a restrictive approach upon the question of remoteness, an approach which reflects the law's early view of usury: see Atiyah, The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract (1979), pp. 65-67, 422-423; Simpson, History of the Common Law of Contract (1975), pp. 114-117, 510-518.
               
In London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.
                  
    [60]
   interest awarded by an official referee upon a debt which he found to be due upon account was disallowed by the House of Lords. It thought that it was compelled by authority and the enactment of the Civil Procedure Act 1833 
                  UK (""
                     Lord Tenterden's Act
                  "") to reach that conclusion, but it did so with stated reluctance. The case of Page v. Newman
                  
    [61]
   particularly influenced the decision. In that case, decided in 1829, the question in issue was whether interest lay on a debt in the absence of express agreement or trade usage to that effect. Lord Tenterden, delivering the opinion of the Court of King's Bench
    [62]
  , held that:It is a rule sanctioned by the practice of more than half a century, that money lent does not carry interest we ought not to depart from the long established rule, that interest is not due on money secured by a written instrument, unless it appears on the face of the instrument that interest was intended to be paid, or unless it be implied from the usage of trade, as in the case of mercantile instruments.Only four years later in 1833 Lord Tenterden sponsored an Act which provided, for the first time, for interest on judgments.

It was in this context that Lord Herschell L.C. said in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.
                  
    [63]
  :
                      one cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that Lord Tenterden, who presided and delivered that judgment, was the author of the statute to which I have been directing the attention of your Lordships under which interest can now be allowed; and when he dealt with the allowance of interest in this statute he certainly introduced language which kept such claims within very narrow limits; speaking for myself, they seem to be too narrow for the purposes of justice. Nevertheless, having regard to the view of the law laid down by the Court of King's Bench in the case which I have just mentioned, and to the statute passed subsequently with obvious reference to it by the Legislature, and the absence since that time of any case in which the doctrine of Lord Mansfield or of Best C.J. has received practical effect in any decision in any of the courts, I do not think it would be possible nowadays to reopen the question, even in this House, and to hold that interest under such circumstances could be awarded.The decision in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. occasioned no great satisfaction at the time and legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1934 to ameliorate its effect. Section 3(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 
                  UK conferred a discretion upon courts to include in any judgment an award of simple interest from the date upon which the cause of action arose to the date of the judgment in any proceedings for the recovery of any debt or damages, except where interest was payable as of right by virtue of an agreement or otherwise. Provision for interest in one form or another is now to be found in the United Kingdom and Australia in the Acts which I have set out above.


[1893] A.C., at pp. 440-441.


               
There were, however, still gaps in the legislation and one such gap was disclosed in President of India v. La Pintada Compania Navigacion S.A.
                  
    [64]
  . In that case it was held that the then current United Kingdom legislation, the Supreme Court Act 1981 
                  UK, s. 35A, afforded no claim for interest upon a sum paid late but before the commencement of proceedings. Nor, so it was held, did the common law afford any such claim in the circumstances of that case. But the House of Lords took the opportunity to review the decision in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. and, whilst declining to depart from it, explained and limited it in the light of two intervening decisions of the Court of Appeal, Trans Trust S.P.R.L. v. Danubian Trading Co. Ltd.
                  
    [65]
   and Wadsworth v. Lydall
                  
    [66]
  . The limitation placed upon London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. was to treat the claim for interest in that case as having been made under the first limb of the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale
                  
    [67]
   and as being too remote under that part of the rule. That is to say, it was held that London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. decided no more than that damages for the detention of a debt are, in the absence of special circumstances, beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties. That, of course, does not preclude the recovery of damages by way of interest if those damages are claimed and proved to arise from special circumstances which are known or ought to be known by the party against whom they are claimed, that is to say, if they fall within the second limb of the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale. The interest claimed in President of India v. La Pintada Compania Navigacion S.A. was not claimed to arise from any special circumstances and was held to be irrecoverable at common law. Whilst recognizing that this result did less than complete justice, the House of Lords took the view that the intervention of the legislature by the modification of the rule laid down in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. precluded any abrogation of that decision by judicial determination.

This case, however, lies outside the ambit of the decision in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. The respondents' claim in this case was not for the recovery of a debt but for damages for the breach of a duty of care on three separate occasions. There were, as the Full Court observed, three separate breaches and three separate causes of action. Each of those causes of action was complete at the time money was paid in error as a result of the appellants' failure to take due care in the preparation of the respondents' income tax returns. At that point the loss flowing from the appellants' negligent conduct crystallized and any further loss accruing as a result of the time taken to effect recovery could form no part of any of those causes of action. 
               
The matter may be tested by asking what would have been the situation if the appellants' error had been discovered on each occasion immediately after it had been made and the money overpaid by the respondents had been promptly repaid to them by the appellants. There could be no question that such repayment would have met the full measure of the respondents' damage. The measure of damages flowing from a tort or breach of contract does not expand according to the length of time taken to obtain an award or effect recovery. No doubt the time taken to effect recovery may occasion further loss by reason of a plaintiff's being kept out of money which is due to him. But that further loss stems not from the tort or, save in cases of debt, from the breach of contract but from the delay in payment. Nor is it to the point to say that the plaintiff is entitled to full restitution. That only provokes the question ""full restitution for what?"" and the answer must be for the tort or breach of contract and not for delay in recovery. No doubt it is just also to provide for compensation for delay in recovery if that delay is not due to any fault on the part of the plaintiff and that is precisely what has been done by legislation in a specific manner. It would be a fundamental error both in logic and principle for this Court to attempt to achieve the same end by somehow incorporating in the original cause of action a head of damages intended to compensate, not for future losses flowing from the tort or breach of contract, but for failure to pay those losses already incurred as a result of the tort or breach of contract.
               
An analogous situation occurred in President of India v. Lips Maritime Corpn
                  
    [68]
   where an umpire in arbitration proceedings had awarded both demurrage and damages for the late payment of the demurrage. The damages for late payment were calculated by reference to the depreciation in sterling between a time determined by the umpire to be the time at which demurrage ought to have been paid and the date of the award. But as Lord Brandon of Oakbrook observed
    [69]
  :Once it is recognized that a claim for demurrage sounds in damages rather than in debt, it becomes apparent that the two concepts, first, of a contractual date for the payment of such damages, and, secondly, of a claim for damages for breach of contract in not paying them by such date, have no basis in law. As I said earlier an owner's cause of action for demurrage, being one for damages, albeit liquidated damages, accrues de die in diem from the moment when the ship is detained beyond the stipulated lay days. There is no such thing as a cause of action in damages for late payment of damages. The only remedy which the law affords for delay in paying damages is the discretionary award of interest pursuant to statute. It follows that the umpire's decision in the present case, in dealing with the owner's claim in respect of demurrage, to add the damages element to the demurrage element, was wrong in law 
                  
               



[1988] A.C. 395.
[1988] A.C., at pp. 424-425.


               
It has been said that as a matter of general principle damages should be assessed as at the date of the wrong: see Wenham v. Ella
                  
    [70]
  , per Gibbs J. The exceptions to the principle — for example, in personal injury claims — throw some doubt upon the extent of its generality, but there can be no doubt about its application in this case. There is no basis for the selection of any other time for the assessment of damages. That is not to say, however, that when damages are assessed as at the time of the wrong, foreseeable future losses which flow from the wrong, and not merely from delay in compensating for the wrong, may not be included in any award. Thus in Wenham v. Ella, which was a case in which damages were awarded for breach of a contract to procure the transfer of a part interest in an income-producing parcel of land, an amount for loss of profits as well as the value of the interest in the land was included in the damages. Moreover, the quantification of future losses may be made by reference to events which have occurred between the time when the cause of action arose and judgment upon the basis that actual facts are preferable to speculation: Willis v. The Commonwealth
                  
    [71]
  . Damages so assessed nevertheless form part of the loss flowing from the breach and are not damages for delay in the payment of damages.


(1972) 127 C.L.R. 454, at p. 473.
(1946) 73 C.L.R. 105, at p. 109.


               
The distinction between foreseeable future losses and loss due to delay in the payment of damages is fundamental. As I have said, to draw the distinction is not to deny the justice of compensation for delay in the payment of damages. The legislature has recognized this in South Australia by making provision for compensation in s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act. Even in the absence of this section precedent would have constituted a considerable obstacle in the way of this Court making its own provision. I have described the sort of difficulties which would be encountered in Trident General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. McNiece Bros. Pty. Ltd.
                  
    [72]
  . The difficulties are, however, insuperable having regard to the presence of s. 30c. That section makes detailed provision for compensation by way of interest in a way which must necessarily prevail over any solution at common law. Under the section the right to interest is liable to be defeated by good cause shown and no compound interest is to be awarded. The interest claimed by the respondents in this case is compound interest and it is claimed as an absolute right. I am unable to see how the Court, even if it were otherwise able to do so, can grant such a claim in the face of the statute. True it is that the statute says in sub-s.(4)(e), that s. 30c does not ""limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest"" but the plain matter of fact is that there was no enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest of the kind claimed by the respondents at the time s. 30c came into force. It is surely one thing to interpret sub-s.(4)(e) as preserving existing remedies. It is quite another thing to construe it as authorizing, in effect, the amendment of the section by the provision of remedies patently inconsistent with the legislative intent. It might at once be observed that similar provision was to be found in s. 28 of Lord Tenterden's Act which, it would seem, was directed to preserving the right, at that time, to recover interest in accordance with trade usage, a right referred to in Page v. Newman. That provision was not thought sufficient to justify the award of interest in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co., notwithstanding the House of Lords' preference for that result. Similarly, I do not think that s. 30c(4)(e) can justify departure from established principle in a manner inconsistent with the remainder of the section. There is nothing to indicate that the paragraph was intended to be anything more than a saving provision.


(1988) 165 C.L.R. 107, at p. 160.


               
This case may serve as an illustration of the distinction between foreseeable future losses and loss due to delay in the payment of damages. The loss by reason of the overpayment of income tax could, and could only, be measured at the time of overpayment by reference to the amount overpaid. It contained no element of future loss. On the other hand, the loss arising from the payment of additional provisional tax could not be measured solely by reference to the additional amount paid. The payment of provisional tax constitutes a payment on account of an income tax liability yet to be assessed. Even if an extra amount is paid in error, that amount will be brought into account when income tax is assessed in the following year. Yet that amount is lost to the taxpayer during the intervening time and he is entitled to be compensated for the loss if it is the result of another's negligent conduct. It is a future loss in the sense that it runs from the time of payment of the additional provisional tax until that payment is offset against liability to tax in the following year. The respondents are therefore entitled to damages in respect of the amount of provisional tax paid in error in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977. The proper measure of compensation upon the findings of fact in the courts below is appropriately interest upon each of the amounts involved between the time of payment and the time that income tax assessed in the following year became due and payable. No question of compound interest arises since the period involved in each instance is not significantly more or less than a year. The appropriate rate of interest is the commercial rate expressed upon an annual basis. The commercial rate of interest may be taken to be that paid by the partnership to Mutual Acceptance (Finance) Ltd. from time to time upon loans made by that company to the partnership during the relevant period. It was not suggested before us that if interest were to be paid for the loss of use of money, that was an inappropriate rate.
               
It follows from what I have said that, apart from interest upon the amounts of provisional tax paid in error, the respondents are not entitled at common law to damages for loss of the use of the amounts overpaid in the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 as a result of the negligence of the appellants. The respondents are, of course, entitled in the absence of good cause shown to an award of statutory interest pursuant to s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act.
               
A further question raised by the appellants' grounds of appeal is whether the Full Court was in error in assessing damages by failing to take into account the incorporation of the partnership business in 1982. Any loss sustained by the respondents ceased to accrue, it was said, when the partnership business passed to the company. For the reasons given above, the incorporation of the partnership business can have no relevance in the calculation of the respondents' damages. Any loss recoverable by the respondents had been sustained by them before 1982. It is unnecessary to consider the point further.
               
I would allow the appeal, refuse special leave to cross-appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial judge and the Full Court. I would remit the matter to the trial judge to enable him to enter judgment by way of damages in the sum of the amounts of income tax overpaid in the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 together with an amount by way of damages for the loss of the additional provisional tax in those years calculated in accordance with these reasons and for interest determined in accordance with s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act.",1989-02-09 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused is a young person charged with the murder of his father, Mr John McCann at Schofields on 30 December 2007. The death occurred when the accused was just short of his 15th birthday.Background2 A question arose as to the accused’s fitness to be tried. A hearing in relation to this issue was held before Buddin J in 2009. On 16 June 2009 his Honour delivered judgment in which he found on the balance of probabilities that the accused was unfit to be tried: R v JH [2009] NSWSC 551. In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) his Honour referred the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal).3 Forensic reviews were carried out by the Tribunal on 20 August 2009 and 11 February 2010. Reports of the Tribunal of 23 September 2009 and 17 February 2010 are before me. The Tribunal found that the accused would not become fit to be tried during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness. On 5 November 2009 the Director of Public Prosecutions notified the Court that further proceedings would be taken in respect of the offence. As a consequence the matter has been listed for special hearing before me pursuant to s 19 of the Act. 4 The purpose of a special hearing is to ensure that, despite the accused’s unfitness to be tried, he is acquitted unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt that on the limited evidence available he committed the offence charged (s 19(2)). The hearing has been conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings (s 21(1)). The accused has been legally represented (s 21(2)). 5 At the commencement of the hearing he was arraigned upon an indictment containing the single charge of murder. He did not enter a plea but was taken to have pleaded not guilty (s 21(3)(a)). He has raised a defence that could properly have been raised at an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings (s 21(3)(c)). Although he had a right to give evidence he equally has a right not to and he has availed himself of the latter (s 21(3)(d)).6 The hearing has been before me without a jury. That is now the default position provided by s 21A of the Act. No election was made by either party for there to be a jury. The verdicts available to me are the verdicts that would have been available to a jury, if there was one, and my verdict will have, for all purposes, the same effects as a verdict of a jury (s 21B(1)). The available verdicts are:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) not guilty of the offence charged;  
         
        (b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness;  
         
        (c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged; and  
         
        (d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged (s 22(1)). 
        
       
      
    7 In this case there has been no suggestion that I should consider finding that the accused committed the alternative offence of manslaughter.8 If I am to return a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness, the only realistic outcome is that the accused will be detained as a forensic patient and not released until such time as the Tribunal is satisfied of certain matters, including, and most importantly, that the safety any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release (s 43(a)).Some relevant legal propositions9 It is necessary that I formally record some legal principles to which I must have regard: s 21B(2) of the Act (see also Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250).10 The Crown bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act of the accused that caused the death of Mr McCann and that it was accompanied by an intention to kill him, an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him, or a reckless indifference to human life. In the circumstances in which Mr McCann’s death occurred, it has not been disputed that it was accompanied by an intention to kill. 11 The accused did not give evidence. He was quite entitled not to. His silence is not evidence against him and nor does it constitute any sort of admission by him. Similarly, his silence may not be used to fill any gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution. It cannot assist one iota in the assessment of whether the prosecution has proved its case. See Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25; 205 CLR 50 per Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [67].12 The defence case concedes that I would find that the accused committed the act causing death and that it was accompanied by the necessary intention. However it is contended that I would be satisfied that the accused was mentally ill at the relevant time and so I should return the special verdict provided by s 38 of the Act, that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness. This requires a consideration as to whether, at the time of the killing, the accused was labouring under a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and the nature of the act he was doing, or that if he did know, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong: R v M’Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718; R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; 55 CLR 182. The onus of proof in respect of this issue is upon the accused and the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; 105 CLR 659; R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511. 
     
      
    13 It is the second leg of the test in M’Naghten that is in issue in this case, that is whether the accused did not know what he was doing was wrong. It is not to the point whether he knew what he was doing was legally wrong. Regina v Cheatham [2000] NSWCCA 282.14 The Crown concedes that I would return the verdict for which the defence contends. 15 Despite the defence conceding that the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and the Crown conceding that the defence has made out its case on the balance of probabilities, they are both matters that I must be satisfied of for myself.The prosecution case16 Tendered before me by consent was a large folder of documentary material that comprises the Crown case directed towards establishing that the accused committed the offence with which he has been charged. The material is consistent with that which was before Buddin J and so I may gratefully draw upon the summary provided in his Honour’s judgment with some additional material interpolated: 
     
      
       
        
        [7] It would appear that the relationship between the accused’s parents broke down in about 1996, when the accused was about 3. From then on the accused lived with his mother. Over the years that followed there were a number of proceedings in the Family Court in which the deceased sought access to the accused. … 
         
         
        [8] Some months before the fatal incident the accused and the deceased (sic – his mother), who were at that stage living in Maitland, discussed the possibility of killing the deceased. At that time the deceased was residing in the Sydney suburb of Schofields. On about 21 December 2007 the accused’s mother went to the Kmart store in Maitland and purchased an axe which she then hid in a cupboard at her home. She and the accused then had further discussions about going to the deceased’s house in order to kill him. Their plan was to kill him and then burn down his house in order to destroy any physical evidence that may have remained.  
         
         
        [9] On the morning of 29 December 2007 the deceased and the accused’s mother spoke on the phone. Arrangements were made for the accused and his mother to travel to Schofields in order to collect a parrot that the deceased no longer wanted. Following that conversation the accused and his mother again discussed killing the deceased. To that end a number of items were obtained including a box of latex gloves, two kitchen knives, the axe (which had been wrapped in a plastic bag), a packet of matches, a packet of Panadeine Forte, a number of Avial capsules and a length of rope.  
         
         
        [10] Some time after noon that day, the accused and his mother travelled by public transport to Schofields. They arrived there between about 8 pm and 9 pm. Upon their arrival they were greeted by the deceased and invited into the house.  
         
         
        [11] The accused’s mother and the deceased had a conversation whilst the accused went into a backroom and watched television. During the course of the evening the accused’s mother offered to make a cup of tea for the deceased. In fact she placed the tablets, which she had brought with her, into warm water and dissolved them. She then placed the contents into a glass of orange juice which she offered to the deceased. The deceased took only one sip of the juice before telling the accused’s mother that it tasted bitter.  
         
         
        [12] In due course the deceased said that he felt tired. He then went to bed and fell asleep. The accused and his mother watched television before they too fell asleep.  
         
         
        [13] At about 2.35 the following morning (December 30), the accused and his mother awoke. The accused’s mother removed the box of latex gloves from the bag which she had brought with her. She and the accused then each placed a pair of gloves on their hands. She handed the axe to the accused and also removed from the bag a kitchen knife which she retained for herself.  
         
         
        [14] The accused and his mother then went to the deceased’s bedroom. The accused placed a pillow over a small night-light which illuminated the hallway. The accused and his mother then swapped weapons so that the accused then had the knife. Both of them then proceeded to attack the deceased with those weapons. The accused’s mother struck a number of blows which inflicted large wounds to the deceased’s chest and upper torso area. The accused also stabbed the deceased a number of times in the upper chest.  
         
         
        [15] The blows caused the deceased to wake up. He pushed the accused’s mother away from him as he attempted to run from the scene. That prompted the accused to again stab the deceased in the region of his upper torso. The deceased was nevertheless able to wrestle the axe from the accused’s mother but by this time he was bleeding profusely. He managed however to get to the front door of the house where he called for help.  
         
         
        [16] The deceased then turned towards the accused and his mother. He proceeded to abuse them whilst still holding the axe. [The accused stabbed him twice more]. The accused and his mother then ran into the deceased’s bedroom and attempted to lock the door. The accused and his mother made good their escape from the house through the window in the toilet area.  
         
         
        [17] In due course the deceased collapsed to the floor near the front door of his house and died. The cause of death was a stab wound [caused by a long-bladed knife] to his right thigh which had penetrated the femoral artery. The deceased had also sustained a number of other injuries but none of them apparently were fatal. Meanwhile the accused and his mother made their way back to Maitland again using public transport.  
         
         
        [18] Upon their return to Maitland, the accused and his mother told a number of witnesses that they had assaulted the deceased with an axe. On 3 January 2008 the accused and his mother attended a real estate agency in Maitland. She handed in the keys to her house having decided that she could not return there. She told the real estate agent about the events which had taken place in the house in Schofields. As a result of that conversation, the real estate agent drew to the attention of the accused’s mother a newspaper article on the internet which reported that the deceased had died as a result of the injuries which had been inflicted upon him.  
         
         
        [19] At about 1.15 that afternoon police from Maitland detectives arrested the accused and his mother as they left the real estate agency. They were taken into custody and transported to Maitland Police Station.  
         
         
        [20] The accused was interviewed in the presence of a support person. … During the course of that interview he made admissions concerning his role in causing the death of his father. He told police that his purpose in travelling to Schofields was to kill his father whom he hated. He explained his feelings towards his father in some detail. He said that the various pieces of equipment that they had taken with them was for the purpose of killing him. The medication which they had with them was to enable them to drug the deceased so that they could then kill him before destroying the house by fire. … 
        
       
      
    17 Some aspects of the police interview with the accused warrant further elaboration. 18 The accused said that at some stage shortly before the killing his mother said that she did not want to do it and proposed that they leave and go home but that he had said, “if you really loved me you would” (Q167). At a later stage of the interview the accused said that in response to his mother’s statement that she did not want to kill the deceased he said, “but if you don’t he’ll ruin my life forever, there’s no point in doing anything or getting a job or anything” (Q380). I take this to be a reference to the accused having recently left school at the age of 14 years 9 months and wanting to obtain employment.19 The accused was asked about the purpose of bringing rope and he said, “we were, were gunna tie him up, but he was still alive when we went out of there and um it didn’t quite work out the plan and we were, tie him up and burn the house with him in it” (Q213).20 There was obviously quite a deal of thought put into the plan to kill the deceased. Apart from the acquisition of various items to take to the deceased’s home for the purpose, it also included the accused bringing black clothing to change into. He chose to wear black so that blood would not show up (Q225). The accused also said that gloves were worn so that fingerprints would not be left (Q424). At this point the accused was also asked about the plan to set fire to the house: 
     
      
       
        
        Q OK. Were you going to burn the house down before or after you killed your father? 
         
        A After. 
         
         
        Q After. And why were you going to do that? 
         
        A So then no one would know who did it. 
         
         
        Q OK. What um, why didn’t you want anybody to know who did it? 
         
        A Because I didn’t want to get into trouble.” (Q847 – 849). 
        
       
      
    21 The accused claimed that he did not stab the deceased very hard because he was “too scared”:  
     
      
       
        
        Q Why were you scared? 
         
        A Because it’s a horrible thing to do. I was just scared to even stab him, because I’ve never done that to anyone, ever, and I never would do that to anyone at all. 
         
         
        Q Why do you think it’s a horrible thing to do? 
         
        A I just think it is. 
         
         
        Q Why did you decide to do it this time? 
         
        A Because I hated all the bad things he’s done to me and other people and he would’ve just ruined my life and there would’ve been no point in doing anything with him around. (Q664 – 666) 
        
       
      
    22 The accused claimed that he would never do the same thing to anyone else but that, in a sense, he was justified in killing his father: 
     
      
       
        
        Q Mmm. You said the words, I never would do that --- 
         
        A To anyone. 
         
         
        Q --- to anyone else at all? 
         
        A That’s right. I wouldn’t want to harm anyone else. 
         
         
        Q OK. Why is that? 
         
        A Because there is no one else horrible. I don’t know any other horrible people. 
         
         
        Q If you --- 
         
        A And even if I came across one I wouldn’t do anything to them. 
         
         
        Q Why not? 
         
        A Because I wouldn’t want to do it again. 
         
         
        Q How come? 
         
        A I just, ‘cause I wouldn’t hate anyone else as much as I hated him. 
         
         
         … 
         
         
        Q And can you tell me how wrong killing someone is? 
         
        A Well, I reckon it’s wrong to kill someone when there’s no reason and they’re innocent people. 
         
         
        Q Uh-huh. 
         
        A But if it’s someone who’s real bad and they’ve done lots of bad things to people and they’ve been real violent, I think it’s right. (Q898-903; Q915-916) 
        
       
      
    23 The accused said that when they left the house he did not realise that his father would die. He saw that he was bleeding but expected that he would somehow get to the phone, call triple 0 and receive treatment that would save his life. He did not find out that his father had died until earlier on the day of his arrest, 3 January 2008. He was asked how he felt when he found out that his father had died and he said, “well, I thought, at least he won’t be able to do anything to me” (Q925). He reiterated that he could not believe that his father had died, “because he was fine when we left” (Q926). However he also confirmed that his intention when he went to Schofields was, “to kill him” (Q927).24 At the end of the interview the accused was asked whether there was anything else that he wished to say and he responded: 
     
      
       
        
        A Well, I don’t want to end up in gaol, ‘cause I don’t think I’ve done a bad thing. 
         
         
        Q You don’t think you’ve done a bad thing? 
         
        A That’s right. I just want to be happy, that’s all. 
         
         
        Q And do you think that you are happier now than you were before? 
         
        A Yes. I don’t feel miserable any more. 
         
         
        Q And what has made you happy? 
         
        A That he’s no longer in my life. 
         
         
        Q And why is he no longer in your life? 
         
        A Because he’s not alive. (Q1033-1037) 
        
       
      
    Conclusion as to the Crown case25 The foregoing evidence, which I accept, clearly establishes beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act of the accused (and his mother) that caused the death of the deceased and at the time the accused had an intention to kill.The defence of mental illness26 Tendered before me is a folder of reports by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, Dr Kenneth Nunn, the accused’s current treating child and adolescent psychiatrist, and the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The overwhelming conclusion from the reports is that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the killing of his father.27 Dr Allnutt described the accused as manifesting delusional beliefs that his father had abused him from a young age; his father had an intention to murder him; his father had raped his mother; and that his father had attempted to poison him for most of his life. Dr Allnutt reported that the accused related these beliefs with a significant degree of conviction. Similar delusional beliefs were related by the accused to other report writers.28 There is no clear evidence that the accused was in fact exposed to physical abuse at the hands of his father. I note that his parents separated when he was only 3 years of age and that from that time onwards he lived with his mother. His mother had custody of him and it would seem there were continual disputes involving the Family Court in relation to the deceased having access. It would seem from the material before me that the accused’s mother was resistant to her former partner having access. It also seems likely that this was a cause of her denigration of the deceased in the eyes of the accused and that this substantially contributed to his beliefs. I am not satisfied that there was substance to any of those beliefs. They were clearly delusional.29 Grove J found the accused’s mother not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter following a judge alone trial: R v Hevesi-Nagy [2009] NSWSC 755. He did so on the basis that she had a substantial impairment of her capacity for self-control. He specifically found that the impairment did not extend to her capacity to understand events or to distinguish right from wrong. It is useful to note the following in his Honour’s judgment on passing sentence (R v Hevesi-Nagy [2009] NSWSC 956) in relation to the interaction between the accused and his mother and the influence that she had over his delusional beliefs concerning his father: 
     
      
       
        
        [16] As I understood Dr Wilcox’s evidence the diagnosed disorder, manifest in your harbouring of persecutory delusions, may have coordinated with some of those harboured by your mentally ill son. In the judgment on the indictment I mentioned the likely recognition by John McCann of the need of the boy for special care. It has been more than unfortunate, indeed I would say disastrous, that you developed what psychiatrists labelled an enmeshed relationship. Your obvious obsession with excluding his father from normal relationship and your seeking to inspire and encourage an unjustified and misguided hatred in the child are background circumstances which do not operate to mitigate your culpability. 
        
       
      
    30 One of the features of the relationship of the accused and his mother was one of relative social isolation. Statements from teachers at the high school that the accused had been attending up until a few months before the death of his father indicate that the accused had few friends at school and none outside of school. He did not interact well with other students and was the victim of bullying. Observations made by those witnesses and others in the material tendered by the Crown, and in the various psychiatric reports, indicate that the accused relied heavily upon his mother and deferred to her to an inordinate degree.31 Dr Allnutt reported that the various beliefs that the accused harboured in relation to his father were compounded by the influence of his mother, and in the absence of any significant others to challenge them, significantly influenced his thinking process to the extent that he maintained them with a degree of conviction. As a result, Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that at the time of the alleged offence the accused “manifested persecutory delusions that related to his father, auditory hallucinations and ideas of external control such as receiving telepathic messages from other people”. Thus Dr Allnutt was of the view that the accused was suffering from a psychosis. He added: 
     
      
       
        
        In addition to this the defendant was of a young and vulnerable age, immature and was intellectually impaired, and would be regarded by most psychiatrists as meeting the legal definition of having a “disease of the mind”. 
        
       
      
    32 Dr Allnutt advised that psychosis is a mental illness which impacts upon an individual’s capacity to make a rational interpretation of their environment and upon a persons capacity to appreciate that they have lost that capacity. He stated that it is a condition that affects reasoning capacity and so at the time of the alleged offence, as a consequence of this disease of the mind, the accused manifested a defect of reason. He added that, “intellectual impairment, immaturity and his social circumstances would only serve to compound these difficulties”.33 Dr Allnutt did not, however, believe that the accused’s defect of reason was of a nature and severity that impacted upon his capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions. However he was also of the view that the accused’s capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his actions was significantly impaired. Dr Allnutt’s report of 23 April 2009 concludes as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not believe that, given his intellectual impairment, psychosis and immaturity (age) at the material time of the alleged offence, that he would have been capable of reasoning about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure and thus he would have available to him a defence of mental illness. 
        
       
      
    34 The earlier report of Dr Olav Nielssen of 19 September 2008 includes a history he obtained from the accused similar to that which appears in other reports. Dr Nielssen made the diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and subnormal intelligence. I note that in the first report of Dr Allnutt of 1 March 2009 he indicated a diagnosis of chronic psychotic disorder with a differential diagnosis including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder with shared delusions. Returning to Dr Nielssen’s report his conclusions included: 
     
      
       
        
        I believe that [JH] has the defence of mental illness available to him. He has an early onset schizophrenic illness that has resulted in a defect of reason in the form (of) impairment in intellectual function and a shared delusional belief about his father. His immature emotional development and low intelligence, and the influence of his mother with whom it appears he shared a delusional belief regarding his father prevented him from realising that his actions in killing his father were morally wrong. 
        
       
      
    35 Dr Nunn has been the accused’s treating child and adolescent psychiatrist since the age of 15 (he is now aged 17 years 4 months). He has provided a number of reports. One prepared for the purpose of the proceedings before Buddin J on 29 April 2009 addresses the issue of whether the mental illness defence is available in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        All three psychiatrists involved (Drs Allnutt, Nielssen and Nunn) share the view that [the accused] is mentally ill, that his illness is that of a chronic psychosis viz, schizophrenia, that the world view and ideation associated with this illness was intimately connected with and ultimately causal to the acts allegedly committed. I am therefore of the view that this young man, a young boy at the time of the alleged offence, has (a) psychiatric basis for a defence of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
        
       
      
    36 There is material in the police interview with the accused that indicates that he was aware of the wrongfulness of killing another human being. However, it also demonstrates that he saw a distinction in relation to the killing of his father (See Q898-903 and Q915-916 extracted above). It would seem that he thought killing somebody who he perceived to be a bad person was in someway justifiable and thus not morally wrong. In my view this further confirms the conclusion reached by the psychiatrists that the delusional beliefs that the accused had about his father prevented him from appreciating the moral wrongfulness of his conduct.Conclusion as to defence case37 The psychiatric evidence points overwhelmingly and unanimously in one direction. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that whilst the accused knew the quality and the nature of his acts which brought about the death of his father, he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind as not to know that what he was doing was wrong.Verdict38 I find the accused to be not guilty on the ground of mental illness.Consequential order39 Section 39 of the Act provides for various consequential orders that may, or must, be made upon the return of such a verdict. In this case there is no question of considering the release of JH, unconditionally or subject to conditions. There is no dispute between the parties that it is appropriate that an order be made that he be further detained until released by due process of law and that is what I propose to do. The only other matter to consider is where and in what manner he should be detained. 
     
      
    40 I have a further report from Dr Kenneth Nunn of 23 February 2010. JH was transferred to the Bronte Adolescent Forensic Intensive Care Unit at the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay in January this year. Dr Nunn’s report is very lengthy and, I might say, very helpful. In short, JH appears to be responding to the treatment he is receiving and is making progress. 
     
      
    41 Dr Nunn notes that JH’s “capacity to further respond to treatment is significant but contingent on a steady social integration and mental health supervision and treatment”. He indicates that a request had been made to the Tribunal to approve JH receiving ongoing care in the Forensic Hospital “for the next six month”. I note in the 17 February 2010 report concerning the second forensic review by the Tribunal that a decision was made pursuant to ss 46 and 47 of the Act that “the current arrangements for [JH]’s care, treatment and detention as a forensic patient at the Forensic Hospital should continue to apply”. 
     
      
    42 It appears to me to be appropriate that the order that I should make is that JH be held there or at such other place as the Tribunal may determine.Orders43 I make the following orders: 
     
      
      1 JH be detained at the Bronte Adolescent Forensic Intensive Care Unit at the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law. 
       
       
      2 The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health of order 1 as soon as practicable. 
       
       
      3 The Registrar is to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of order 1 as soon as practicable and provide to the Tribunal the following documentation: 
       
       
      (a) a copy of these reasons for verdict and orders, and 
       
       
      (b) a transcript of this special hearing.

98,2863564,R v Droudis (No. 10) [2016] NSWSC 1305,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has tendered seven photographs of Man Monis (MFI36). Objection is taken to the tender of the photographs essentially upon the basis that there is an insufficient nexus between these photographs and the Accused, Amirah Droudis.
	
	
	At the outset, it is acknowledged for the Accused that these photographs form part of a number of items of evidence that were the subject of a ruling which I made on 12 August 2016, admitting evidence on a number of bases, including motive, relationship, state of mind and for tendency purposes.
	
	
	A particular objection, however, is directed to these items which, it is said, ought not be admitted for other reasons relating to the suggested insufficient nexus with the Accused.
	
	
	The evidence on the voir dire indicates that the photographs were taken on 31 July 2014, using a Sony mobile phone, which was seized from the Accused on 15 December 2014, when she was located in a Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle.
	
	
	The photographs were discovered on an M-TECH USB located at the Belmore address of the Accused's family on 16 December 2014.
	
	
	There is evidence on the voir dire that the headband which is being worn by Monis, contains Arabic script which states ""We are your soldiers Mohammed, May Allah honour him and grant him peace"".
	
	
	The photographs were taken in premises at Wiley Park which were occupied by Monis and the Accused in 2014.
	
	
	The photographs depict Monis apparently seated. In a number of the photographs, he is posing with his hands folded, sitting in front of a bookcase. The images depicted in the photographs are inconsistent with them being so-called “selfies” where he himself would have been holding the mobile phone.
	
	
	The defence submission is that it is quite possible that Monis took these photographs himself, using a timer in the mobile phone, so that the Accused herself was not connected with the taking of the photographs.
	
	
	The Crown submits that these photographs are one piece of evidence in a circumstantial case involving many pieces.
	
	
	The question at this point is one of admissibility. It is the case that the Accused is not depicted in the photographs, nor is there direct evidence that she took them. There are, however, a number of factors which may provide a foundation for such a conclusion, bearing in mind that all I am considering at this stage is the admissibility of the evidence, and not what conclusions might be reached with respect to it.
	
	
	As I have said, the photographs were recovered on her mobile phone. The M-TECH USB stick was located in the Belmore premises in December 2014. The photographs were taken in premises which were occupied by the Accused and Monis at the relevant time in 2014.
	
	
	In my view, there is a sufficient nexus, for the purpose of admissibility, between the Accused and the photographs. What conclusions can be reached by reference to the photographs will be an issue to be considered in light of the totality of the evidence in the Crown's circumstantial case.
	
	
	I am satisfied, however, that these photographs (MFI36) ought be admitted and I so rule.

99,6267875,SafeWork NSW v Tolputt [2017] NSWDC 285,"Judgment

The charge and the plea


	
	Jeremi Scott Tolputt, the defendant, is charged with a breach of s 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act) in that on 1 June 2015 at 73 Cape Three Points Road, Avoca Beach (the property), he failed to comply with a duty under s 28(b). The duty was owed to several persons, being Benjamin Martin, Jessie Powell, James Amson, Adam Hanscombe, Blake Currie and Michael Bell. The defendant has pleaded guilty.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 28(b) provides:
	


While at work, a worker must:

…

(b)   take reasonable care that his or her acts or omissions do not    adversely affect the health and safety of other persons …


	
	The defendant was a worker within the meaning of the section.
	
	
	Section 32 relevantly provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:

(a)   the person has a health and safety duty, and

(b)   the person fails to comply with that duty, and

(c)   the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.


	
	The maximum penalty applicable in this case is $150,000. I pause here to note that Mr Docking, who appeared for the prosecutor, drew my attention to the fact that s 32 provides for two categories where an offence is committed by an individual. One category provides for the maximum penalty of $150,000, the other provides for a maximum penalty of $300,000. He further drew my attention to different interpretations and whether truly the category of offence imposing the maximum penalty of $300,000 was appropriate. It tended to become something of an academic point in light of his instruction that this was a $150,000 case and not a $300,000 case. In any event, I have satisfied myself with the fact that it is a $150,000 case, by reason of the way the amended summons is pleaded. The $300,000 category requires that the offence be committed by an individual as a person conducting a business or undertaking or as an officer of a person conducting a business or undertaking. It may have been the fact that the defendant was carrying on a business or undertaking. If that was so, it was not pleaded as such. At least that is the way I read the amended summons.
	


The evidence


	
	The prosecutor tendered an agreed sentencing bundle of documents (Exhibit PX 1). Also tendered were extracts from records of interview that had been conducted with Mr Bradshaw, Mr Hanscombe and Mr Jessie Powell.
	
	
	The defendant relied on two affidavits of himself. One was sworn on 29 August 2017 and the other on 31 August 2017. The former related to his financial position. The latter put forward evidence in mitigation.
	
	
	The defendant also tendered an extract from a record of interview with Mr Martin. He also relied on what might be called character evidence. In that regard, there was a reference from Mr Gesling and there were affidavits from Julie Edwards, Benjamin Ward and Graeme Baker.
	
	
	The defendant was present throughout the proceedings and he gave evidence and was cross-examined.
	


Facts


	
	The parties provided an Agreed Statement of Facts which I summarise.
	
	
	The defendant, at all material times, was a self-employed tree-climbing contractor who performed tree and rope access work including for persons conducting a business or undertaking. He was a qualified Level 3 Arborist, and had been in the tree industry for a long time and was very skilled. He had before 1 June 2015 completed numerous jobs for Bradshaw Tree Services Pty Ltd (BTS). On 1 June 2015, he was contracted by BTS to remove a tree.
	
	
	In April 2015, the Central Coast was hit by a severe storm. The result was a tree fell onto a house on the property. The tree was a 17m bark tree. Most of its foliage and branches were directly overhanging the roofline. The property was a steep block, sloping away from the road. Access to the property was limited.
	
	
	BTS was contracted to inspect the fallen tree and remove it. Mr Bradshaw, the sole director of BTS, conducted his inspection on 27 May 2015 and completed a “BTS Safety Analysis”. He contemplated in that analysis “a process that the surrounding trees were to be used as lowering points to swing sections of the canopy that were over the roof and then lower them to the ground at the rear of the house. The process involved using an experienced climber with a team of labourers to drag branches and parts of the tree from the bottom of the back yard to the top of the property safely with the wood chipper to be used last”.
	
	
	Mr Bradshaw arranged for the following people to attend the property and remove the tree:
	



	
	The defendant was contracted as a specialist climber to access and dismantle the tree;
	
	
	Mr Jessie Powell (a BTS worker), to operate the chainsaws to cut felled section of the tree into smaller pieces for removal from the property;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell of IMS as Site Supervisor. IMS was a labour hire organisation;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell to provide five ground workers from IMS to drag branches and small sections from the rear of the property to the road. The labour hire workers included:
	



	
	Benjamin Martin;
	
	
	James Amson;
	
	
	Michael Bell;
	
	
	Adam Hanscombe; and
	
	
	Blake Currie.
	



	
	On 1 June 2015, Ashley Powell went to see Mr Bradshaw at 6:00am and picked up ropes integral to the work method outlined in the BTS Safety Analysis, and a harness and other equipment, to take to the property. The harness supplied was a tree harness, not a fall arrest harness which would have been necessary for roof work. The ropes were to assist in supporting the damaged tree during dismantling and the harness was to be used by a worker to access the roof to clean it of branches and debris following the tree removal. Mr Bradshaw also provided a copy of the BTS Safety Analysis to Ashley Powell.
	
	
	Ashley Powell headed towards the property, but following a telephone call, diverted to attend a school to resolve a public safety issue.
	
	
	Jessie Powell and the defendant arrived at the property. The defendant had spoken with Mr Bradshaw about the method to be used, but at the property he did not believe it would work. He did not contact Mr Bradshaw to speak to him about that. He did not wait for Mr Powell to arrive. Instead, the defendant decided that the only way to take down the tree would be to climb the roof to go up inside the tree, find the highest point and bring small pieces down on the roof. The pieces were then to be chopped up by the labourers in the backyard and dragged out by hand.
	
	
	Other workers arrived at the site. Jessie Powell spoke with Ashley Powell who informed him that he would be late. Ashley Powell had the BTS Safety Analysis with him and no other worker had seen it. Ashley Powell did not provide any direction that work not start until he arrived.
	
	
	Work commenced. The defendant was in the tree. Other workers assisted him with lowering parts of the tree. A saw was brought up to the roof. The defendant, Jessie Powell and all five labour hire workers were then on the roof.
	
	
	Ropes were used with a pulley system. A load would be tied around that rope then lowered using the rope and pulley. The load would swing slowly as it was lowered.
	
	
	When a branch was coming down, the defendant would stop cutting. Once lowered, Jessie Powell would cut the load into smaller pieces which were then thrown off the roof.
	
	
	At around 9:00am, the smaller branches had all been removed and thrown to the ground below.
	
	
	The defendant rigged the rope to cut a more substantial branch section that was to be lowered. When the cut was completed, the section of approximately one metre in length and 30 to 40 centimetres in diameter fell and swung at an angle out towards the edge of the roof. The defendant told the workers that this load was going to swing and they needed to move as they were in the flight path of the cut section and that this load could knock them all off the roof. They all moved out of the way where they believed it was going to swing.
	
	
	Whilst the section was being lowered using the rope, Mr Amson did not expect it to swing as hard as it did and the section hit Mr Amson’s left shoulder. The section then swung across to hit Mr Martin who walked from behind Mr Amson and towards the swinging section. The force of the strike knocked Mr Martin off balance. He stumbled and rolled towards the edge of the roof. Mr Amson brought down the section as quickly as possible, jumped towards Mr Martin and was able to grab Mr Martin’s ankle. Mr Martin went over the edge and Mr Amson could not continue to hold him. Mr Martin grabbed the gutter at the roof edge which came off the roof fascia. Mr Martin fell approximately 11 metres to the ground below. He fell directly into the mass of loose foliage and small branches that had collected to a depth of 1.5 metres on the ground thus cushioning his fall.
	
	
	As a result of the incident, Mr Martin sustained a fractured shoulder and required physiotherapy. He also suffered from minor flashbacks and had difficulty sleeping.
	
	
	Had the defendant contacted Mr Bradshaw when he formed a view that the job could not be done as planned, or had he waited for Mr Ashley Powell to arrive, the job would not have been done in the manner it was.
	


The risk


	
	There was a risk to the workers of death or serious injury from:
	



	
	being hit by parts of the fallen tree that were being felled, dropped or lowered from their position during the removal of the tree;
	
	
	falling approximately 11 metres from the roof to the ground below at the property.
	


Codes of practice


	
	There were codes of practice in place at the time of the incident. They included:
	



	
	the “Code of Practice for the Amenity Tree Industry” of August 1998 (the Tree Code); and
	
	
	the “Managing the Risk of Falls at Workplace Code of Practice” of January 2012 (the Falls Code).
	



	
	The Tree Code notes that tree work is hazardous and that each year many people are killed or injured in the tree industry.
	
	
	The Falls Code dealt with falls in a workplace generally. There was a risk of fall within the meaning of the Code.
	
	
	The work being undertaken at the property was a high risk storm damage job.
	
	
	The defendant failed to take reasonable care that his acts or omissions did not adversely affect the health and safety of other persons in contravention of s28(b) of the Act. One particular is expressed as: failing to “after inspecting the site not commencing and undertaking tree felling, dropping or lowering work that required workers to be on the roof”. That is acknowledged to be somewhat inelegantly worded. The intent is clear enough. It is that the defendant’s work method required workers to be on the roof after he had inspected the site.
	
	
	The defendant was the most experienced and competent person at the property. He should have refused to do the job after inspecting the tree and the surrounding trees. He has acknowledged as much in his affidavit.
	
	
	Further particulars are also somewhat inelegantly expressed. They may be, however, defined as follows.
	


(b)   Mr Tolputt undertook the task without:


	
	consulting Mr Bradshaw as to an alternative to the plan they had earlier discussed;
	
	
	ensuring that no more than two workers were on the roof;
	
	
	ensuring that anyone on the roof used travel restraint equipment to prevent free fall.
	



	
	The Falls Code provides that persons other than a person conducting a business or undertaking may also have a responsibility for health and safety. The same message is set out in another code being the Work Health and Safety Consultation, Co-operation and Co-ordination Code of Practice of New South Wales of December 2011 (the Safety Consultation Code). The Safety Consultation Code provides, in effect, for cooperation and coordination between duty holders responsible for the same task.
	
	
	I note at this point that Mr Bradshaw and the defendant had coordinated and cooperated, but the defendant departed from the plan that had been set by Mr Bradshaw and agreed to by the defendant and did so without coordination and cooperation with Mr Bradshaw.
	
	
	The Falls Code requires that workers exposed to risk of fall should be adequately supervised, have received training and instruction in relation to the work and use fall control measures.
	
	
	At the time, WorkCover had a publication as to “Vulnerable Workers”. Basically, they are those who are young or lacking in experience. Messrs Martin, Hanscombe, Currie and Jessie Powell were clearly vulnerable workers. They were all young. Though 34 years old, Mr Amsom may also be classified as a vulnerable worker.
	
	
	The job should not have started without the workers having travel restraint systems.
	
	
	Safe systems for minimising risks of falls were available. Such systems are provided for in The Falls Code, the SafeWork Code and the National Code of Practice for the Prevention of Falls in Housing Construction of SafeWork Australia of April 2010.
	
	
	Approximately one week after the incident, the defendant and Ashley Powell attended the site to complete the removal of the tree. One worker assisted the defendant on the roof. The defendant and the worker on the roof wore harnesses. Two ropes were tied off the front of the house and the top of the roof with secure anchor points to harness the workers in case they fell. Branches were lowered either directly onto the ground or onto the roof and then the ground. The defendant provided this extra safety equipment for the worker because it was not provided by BTS. On this occasion, the defendant provided this extra equipment to guard against any recurring incident.
	


The sentencing process


	
	I bear in mind several matters. I bear in mind the purposes of sentencing as enumerated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I bear in mind the purposes of the work health and safety legislation, in particular ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers and others on workplace premises. I bear in mind any relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including any mentioned in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so far as any of those may be relevant.
	
	
	I start my analysis with a consideration of the gravity of the offence. This may be determined in part by the foreseeability of the risk of injury, the foreseeability of the consequences of the risk coming home and the measures available to avoid the risk.
	
	
	Foreseeability in this case was plain and needs no explanation. This is at two levels. First, risk of injury from swinging timber and from fall from roof were clearly foreseeable. Secondly, the potential consequences of those risks coming home were clearly foreseeable and that included potential fatal injury.
	
	
	Measures were readily available to eliminate the risk in this case.
	
	
	Paragraph 5 of the Amended Summons sets out the measures the prosecutor relies on in this case. The defendant accepts that the measures relied on by the prosecutor were readily available and I have already referred to them. In short, they are not proceeding with the task after inspecting the site, consulting with Mr Bradshaw about an alternative method, ensuring the use of travel restraint systems. Further, there was the measure adopted to undertake the task after the incident and already referred to.
	
	
	General deterrence needs to be considered and allowed for in the penalty. The Court of Appeal has stressed the importance of this in Bulga Underground Operations v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37. Those operating in the industry must understand that safety is paramount and failure to comply with safety requirements will have consequences. As the Tree Code notes, tree work is hazardous and many people in the industry are killed or injured each year.
	
	
	Specific deterrence must also be factored in. The defendant does not do tree work of the kind he was doing at the time of this incident. He still, however, operates in a risky industry with considerable work at heights. I accept the defendant’s evidence and that of others that he is a very safety conscious person and more so since in the incident.
	
	
	There are aggravating factors that may be taken into account. There are two matters. One is the injuries to Mr Martin may be described as substantial – Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(g). The other is the offence included a grave risk of death – s 21A(2)(ib).
	
	
	There is a number of factors to be taken into account on behalf of the defendant. He has no prior conviction related to health and safety matters. That has to be seen in the context of operating in the industry for a long time.
	
	
	The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	The affidavits that I have mentioned attest to the defendant being a person of good character. I pause to note that on many occasions he has volunteered his time and work in the cause and assistance of others. I accept his evidence as to the effect this incident has had upon him and his ready recognition from the outset that the task should not have been undertaken the way it was.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he is unlikely to reoffend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	There is some evidence that is somewhat confusing, particularly as to his attempts to contact Mr Bradshaw or anybody from Mr Bradshaw’s business before undertaking the task. I am satisfied, however, that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has done so more or less from the outset.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty and is entitled to consideration for that. The benefit of a plea of guilty lies essentially in its utilitarian value and, accordingly, normally, the earlier the plea, the greater the value. The plea of guilty was entered practically immediately upon the settling of the amended summons. It was fairly evident from his first interview that this was likely to be a plea. I think in the circumstances, he is entitled to the full benefit of an early plea.
	
	
	The prosecutor has acknowledged frankly that there has been considerable assistance from the defendant and from his lawyers in the course of the investigations and the prosecution of these proceedings.
	
	
	The defendant led financial evidence seeking to call in aid s 6 of Fines Act 1996. The prosecutor frankly acknowledges that the evidence is sufficient for the discharge of the defendant’s onus in this regard. I bear in mind the defendant’s state of indebtedness, his limited resources, his uncertainty of work, his ongoing business financial commitments, his family situation of non-working wife and five children with another due shortly and also his liability for the costs of these proceedings which the prosecutor estimates could be about $24,000.
	
	
	All these mitigating matters lead to a result that will be less of a fine than would otherwise be imposed in the circumstances. In all the circumstances, including the allowance for the discount for the plea of guilty, I think the appropriate penalty is the sum of $20,000.
	


ORDERS


	
	The defendant is convicted and fined the sum of $20,000 with a moiety to the prosecutor.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs as may be agreed or assessed.
