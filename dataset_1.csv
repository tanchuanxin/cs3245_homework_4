Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):

Introduction

1     On the evening of 2 December 2002, a tragic accident caused by a negligent driver, who was the second respondent in Civil Appeal No 85 of 2007 (“CA 85/2007”), robbed two loving parents – the appellants in CA 85/2007 (“the appellants”) – of their only children, two teenage sons. Overnight, the appellants’ close-knit family was torn apart and the appellants found themselves childless. They sued the second respondent in CA 85/2007 (“the second respondent”) for:

(a)   bereavement;

(b)   funeral expenses;

(c)   loss of dependency;

(d)   damages for post-traumatic shock and depression; and

(e)   the cost of fertility treatment undertaken in their attempts (which were ultimately unsuccessful) to conceive another child.

The first respondent in CA 85/2007 (“the first respondent”) was joined as a co-defendant to the appellants’ suit only at a later stage (see [4] below).

2     Being dissatisfied with various aspects of the decision made by the assistant registrar (“the AR”) (see Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh v Dilveer Singh Gill s/o Shokdarchan Singh [2007] SGHC 73 (“the AR’s GD”)) and affirmed in part by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) on appeal (see Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh v Dilveer Singh Gill s/o Shokdarchan Singh [2007] 4 SLR 843 (“the Judge’s GD”)), the appellants appealed to this court via CA 85/2007. The first respondent also filed a cross-appeal to this court (via Civil Appeal No 86 of 2007 (“CA 86/2007”)) against part of the Judge’s decision.

The facts

3     The appellants are Mr Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh (“the first appellant”) and his wife, Mdm Jasbir Kaur (“the second appellant”). They are the lawful parents of Gurjiv Singh (“Gurjiv”) and Pardip Singh (“Pardip”). On 2 December 2002, Gurjiv and Pardip went out with their cousin, who had rented a car bearing the registration number SZA 7159 S. Sometime after 6.00pm on the same day, Gurjiv and Pardip were travelling as back-seat passengers in the car, which was then being driven by the second respondent, a friend of the cousin. The second respondent lost control of the car, which skidded and hit a tree along Changi Village Road. Gurjiv and Pardip died as a result of the accident. They were 17 years old and 14 years old, respectively, at that time.

4     The second respondent left the country after the accident and did not defend the appellants’ action against him. Interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was entered against him on 26 April 2004. The second respondent likewise did not appear before the AR at the assessment of damages, or before the Judge or this court in the ensuing appeals. The first respondent, which was the insurer of the car at the material time, included itself as a party to the action after interlocutory judgment against the second respondent was entered so as to defend the quantum of the awards made to the appellants in respect of the deaths of Gurjiv and Pardip.

The decisions below

5     As provided for under s 21(4) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), the AR awarded the appellants a total of $20,000 for bereavement. He also awarded the appellants a sum of $10,000 for funeral expenses (the parties later agreed on a sum of $7,000 for this particular item). For the dependency claims, the AR awarded $68,508 and $78,165 for loss of dependency arising from the deaths of Gurjiv and Pardip, respectively. The appellants’ claim for a sum of $10,000 for post-traumatic shock and depression, plus $200 for the cost of transport to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) to attend grief therapy was denied by the AR.

6     The Judge did not disturb the above aspects of the AR’s decision. However, he overruled the AR in respect of the appellants’ claim for the cost of fertility treatment undertaken in their attempts, following the deaths of Gurjiv and Pardip, to have another child after natural means of procreation did not succeed. The AR had awarded the sum of $32,847.90 for this head of claim on the basis that it was reasonably foreseeable to persons in the position of the second respondent that their negligence could cause persons such as the appellants to lose the sum total of their offspring in the resulting accident. The Judge considered the expenses incurred by the appellants for the purposes of fertility treatment to be a loss that was too remote and that the first respondent and the second respondent (referred to collectively as “the respondents”) should therefore not be held liable for.

The issues on appeal

7     Before us, the appellants argued (in CA 85/2007) for:

(a)   an increase in the awards for loss of dependency;

(b)   damages for post-traumatic shock and depression; and

(c)   the cost of the fertility treatment which they went through.

The first respondent cross-appealed (in CA 86/2007) on the quantum of the awards for loss of dependency. We shall now proceed to deal with each of these issues seriatim.

The awards for loss of dependency

8     The breakdown of the AR’s awards for loss of dependency arising from Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s deaths, respectively, is as follows:







 


Gurjiv


Pardip





Projected median monthly gross
salary


$1,730


$2,412.50





Percentage of prospective salary
apportioned to the appellants


30%


30%





Multiplicand


$519 (ie, 30% of
$1,730)


$723.75 (ie, 30% of
$2,412.50)





Multiplier


11 years


9 years





Total sum awarded


$68,508


$78,165





The Judge upheld the AR’s awards.

9     It should be noted that the AR arrived at the above figures for Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s respective prospective earnings based on the method of calculation submitted by the appellants. In essence, he derived the projected median monthly gross salary for each of the deceased sons by taking the average of:

(a)   the average median monthly commencement salary of each son; and

(b)   the average median monthly salary which that son would have earned (“average median monthly salary”).

The figures for both the average median monthly commencement salary and the average median monthly salary were derived from the Ministry of Manpower’s “Report on Wages in Singapore, 2005”  (accessed 14 May 2008) (“the MOM Report”), which both parties had accepted as the basis for computing Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s projected earnings.

10    In CA 85/2007, the appellants sought to raise the proportion of the projected earnings that Gurjiv and Pardip (had they not died in the accident) would have contributed to them from 30% to 40%, and argued that the multiplier should be increased to 13 years in respect of Gurjiv’s death and 11 years in respect of Pardip’s death. On its part, the first respondent cross-appealed (in CA 86/2007) for a reduction in the multiplicand and the multiplier which would lower the awards for loss of dependency to $25,200 and $17,280 with regard to Gurjiv and Pardip, respectively.

11    Before dealing with the first respondent’s specific objections to the AR’s awards for loss of dependency, we shall first address its argument that the AR’s awards meant that Gurjiv and Pardip would have been expected to contribute a total of $1,242.75 to the appellants every month and that this was “not realistic”. The first respondent submitted that the combined multiplicand for both Gurjiv and Pardip should instead be $660 per month, comprising a monthly contribution of $300 from Gurjiv and $360 from Pardip. This “total contribution” argument is untenable. In Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd [1984-1985] SLR 10, a Singapore decision that went on appeal before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, it was stated (at 13, [8] per Lord Fraser of Tullybelton) – which position we affirm – that:

[T]he only proper way of deciding whether the global award is too low or too high is by assessing the separate items and arriving at a fair total.

Multiplicand

Prospective earnings

12    The first respondent contended that the AR had pitched Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s employment prospects at a level “much higher than what the evidence show[ed]”. In this regard, the first respondent compared the factual matrix of the present appeals with that in Ho Yeow Kim v Lim Hai Kuen [1999] 2 SLR 246 (“Ho Yeow Kim”), where the deceased son (a 17-year-old accident victim) had already been in the final stages of his mechatronics engineering course at the Institute of Technical Education (“ITE”) when he died, such that his employment prospects were less speculative than those of Gurjiv and Pardip at the time of their deaths. The first respondent did not dispute before this court the finding of fact (based on the evidence of the appellants as well as the vice-principal and teachers of Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, where Gurjiv and Pardip had been studying at the time of the accident) that Gurjiv and Pardip would likely have attended the ITE and a polytechnic, respectively. However, the first respondent argued that even if Gurjiv and Pardip would have attended these institutions had they lived, there was inconclusive evidence as to what courses they would have pursued. It also took issue with the fact that the appellants did not call any representative from the ITE or a polytechnic to give evidence at the assessment of damages before the AR. We do not give credence to these arguments. The testimony of representatives from the ITE or a polytechnic, who would not have known Gurjiv or Pardip, would not necessarily have been more helpful than the written and oral testimonies of the above-mentioned vice-principal and teachers of Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School. If the first respondent had wished to adduce contradictory evidence at the assessment of damages before the AR, it should have summoned the appropriate witnesses at that hearing (which it did not do).

13    The first respondent argued that the AR had erred in accepting the appellants’ calculations of Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s prospective average monthly gross salaries, which (so the first respondent contended) were “based on the average between the mean commencement wage and the mean wage at the tail end of the working life”. It submitted that the AR should instead have adopted the approach taken in Ho Yeow Kim (which was not disapproved on appeal to the Court of Appeal), where the assistant registrar had calculated the deceased son’s projected earnings based on the mean salary of a mechatronics engineering graduate (mechatronics engineering being the course which the deceased son had been pursuing at the time of his death) after six to nine months of employment and the mean salary of such a graduate after five years of employment. In response, the appellants clarified that their calculations of Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s projected earnings had been based on the average of:

(a)   the average median monthly commencement salary, as stated in the MOM Report, of a graduate from either the ITE (in Gurjiv’s case) or a polytechnic (in Pardip’s case); and

(b)   the average median monthly salary, in terms of the average median monthly gross salary for males (likewise as stated in the MOM Report) for the types of employment which Gurjiv and Pardip were likely to have taken up.

14    In our view, even if the first respondent’s argument is accepted such that the average median monthly salary which the AR relied on for the purposes of calculating the multiplicand (see [9] above) is replaced with the median monthly gross salary which Gurjiv and Pardip, respectively, would have been expected to earn after five to 15 years of employment, the alternative measure of the multiplicand would not vary substantially from that calculated based on the figures submitted by the appellants and accepted by the AR. The following table compares the average median monthly salary which the AR accepted with each son’s median monthly gross salary at the age of 30–34 years (ie, after approximately five to ten years’ employment) and at the age of 35–39 years (ie, after approximately ten to 15 years’ employment):







 


Gurjiv


Pardip





Average median monthly salary


$2,070


$2,850





Median monthly gross salary at
30–34 years of age


$1,893


$2,750





Median monthly gross salary at
35–39 years of age


$2,002


$2,916





As the data demonstrates that the first respondent’s alternative calculations would yield median monthly gross salaries that do not differ significantly from those submitted by the appellants and adopted by the AR, we are of the view that the first respondent’s objections to the AR’s determination of Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s prospective earnings are without merit.

Amount of prospective earnings to be apportioned to the appellants

15    In terms of how much of their prospective earnings Gurjiv and Pardip were likely (had they lived) to have contributed to the appellants, the AR accepted the first respondent’s submission that 30% would be an appropriate rate of apportionment, rather than 40% as claimed by the appellants. In deciding on this percentage, the AR took into account the following considerations:

(a)   if Gurjiv and Pardip had not been killed in the accident, they might, in the event of marriage, have reduced the quantum of their contributions to the appellants;

(b)   some discount had to be given for the advance receipt of a lump sum;

(c)   there would have been two children (ie, Gurjiv and Pardip) supporting the appellants; and

(d)   the appellants were not in urgent need for money given the first appellant’s present age and earning capacity.

16    The appellants argued that this court should follow its previous decision in Ho Yeow Kim ([12] supra), where it was held that the deceased son would, on average, have apportioned 40% of his prospective salary to his parents. (As mentioned earlier (at [12]–[13] above), the deceased son in that case had been a mechatronics engineering student at the ITE at the time of his death. He had been assessed to have had a 70% chance of successfully completing his course and graduating from the ITE.)

17    When young persons meet untimely deaths in accidents, any assessment of loss of dependency entails, by its very nature, a measure of estimation. However, this is not a valid reason for applying, in all cases, conservative estimates that would invariably put the defendants in a more advantageous position than the grief-stricken loved ones and future dependants of the victims. In the present appeals, it is both logical and fair to assume, based on an extrapolation from the last available academic results of Gurjiv and Pardip, that they would have completed their studies at the appropriate level had they lived; in this respect, they should not be treated any differently from the deceased son in Ho Yeow Kim. Support for this position can be found in the Singapore High Court decision of Tan Ngo Hwa v Siew Mun Phui [1998] SGHC 376 (“Tan Ngo Hwa”), in which the 16-year-old accident victim, the only child, had not taken either her General Certificate of Education “Ordinary” Level or “Advanced” Level examinations yet at the time of her death. Taking into consideration the financial situation of the victim’s family, the judge opined that while the academic results of the victim suggested that she might not have qualified for the local universities, it was likely that her parents could have afforded to send her overseas for her tertiary education. On the basis of this assumption, the judge computed the prospective earnings of the victim and, in turn, the monthly amount which she was likely to have given to her parents from her earnings had she lived. In Ho Yeow Kim, Yong Pung How CJ did not question the judge’s reasoning when he referred to Tan Ngo Hwa.

18    In the circumstances, therefore, we are inclined to raise the apportionment rate in the present appeals to 40% so as to be in line with Ho Yeow Kim as well as a more recent Singapore High Court decision, Tan Harry v Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius [2004] 1 SLR 513. However, in view of the likelihood that both Gurjiv and Pardip would have married and established their own families by their early to mid-twenties, which was also the second appellant’s stated wish for them, we are of the view that an apportionment rate of 35% would be more appropriate. The multiplicand would thus be $605.50 per month (35% of $1,730) and $844.38 per month (35% of $2,412.50) for Gurjiv and Pardip, respectively – ie, the total amount that Gurjiv and Pardip would have contributed monthly had they lived would have been $1,449.88 ($605.50 plus $844.38) (“the sons’ total monthly contribution”).

Multiplier

19    Taking a broad-brush approach, the AR set a multiplier for each of the deceased sons instead of apportioning each son’s contribution between the appellants, as follows (see the AR’s GD at [29]):

… I decided to adopt a broad[-]brush approach and did not distinguish between how much each son would have given to each of [the appellants]. Accordingly, I granted a multiplier of 11 years for Gurjiv and 9 years for Pardip, to take into account the difference in their ages. [emphasis added]

20    The appellants sought to raise the multiplier to 13 years and 11 years, respectively, in relation to Gurjiv’s death and Pardip’s death. The first respondent, on the other hand, contended that seven years and four years, respectively, would be the more appropriate figures for the multiplier.

21    In the Singapore High Court decision of Ng Siew Choo v Tan Kian Choon [1990] SLR 331 at 333–334, [7], Yong Pung How J quoted the following statement of principle by Greer LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of Flint v Lovell [1935] 1 KB 354 at 360:

In order to justify reversing the trial judge on the question of [the] amount of damages, it will generally be necessary that this court should be convinced either that the judge acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that [the] amount awarded was so extremely high or so very small as to make it, in the judgment of this court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.

While bearing the above principle in mind, our view, with respect, is that the multiplier fixed by the AR (and affirmed by the Judge) in respect of each of the deceased sons is unjustifiably low and warrants an upward adjustment.

22    Before we proceed further, we should clarify that while we appreciate the logic of the AR’s reasoning in departing, in the circumstances of the present case, from the conventional approach of applying a separate multiplier for each dependant (as illustrated by, inter alia, the Singapore High Court decision of Ling Kee Ling v Leow Leng Siong [1995] 2 SLR 189 at 191, [8]), we are of the view that adopting a separate multiplier for each dependant is still the preferable approach and, conceptually, the neater solution. Even after accounting for the unusual facts of the present appeals, the AR’s approach would, with respect, give rise to difficulties when compared to decided cases. Furthermore, it would tend to obscure dependant-specific factors, such as age and life expectancy, which are important considerations when setting the multiplier. For example, a mother would typically have a longer life expectancy than a father and, if she was a housewife, she would also for that reason have a greater need for financial support.

23    The main cases in this area of law suggest that the multiplier set by the court usually ranges from between eight to 12 years. In the Singapore High Court decision of Sim Hau Yan v Ong Sio Beng [1996] SGHC 256, the accident victim was 26 years old and was working as a supervisor at the time of his death. Goh Joon Seng J fixed the multiplier at nine years for the victim’s 56-year-old father and 12 years for the 53-year-old mother.

24    In Tan Ngo Hwa ([17] supra), both the father and the mother of the accident victim were aged 46 years at the time of her death and 49 years at the date of the assessment of damages. The court set a multiplier of eight years for the father and ten years for the mother, and noted (at [28]) that the defendant’s counsel had not objected to an assumed life expectancy of 70 years for each parent. In Ho Yeow Kim ([12] supra), the father of the deceased son was 49 years old at the time the dependency action was commenced. The Court of Appeal raised the multiplier in that case from seven years to ten years to align it with Tan Ngo Hwa (see Ho Yeow Kim at [32]–[33]).

25    More recently, in the Singapore High Court decision of Lee Kwan Kok v Wong Chan Tong [2004] SGHC 211 (“Lee Kwan Kok”), the deceased was 25 years old at the time of his death; his father and his mother were 50 years old and 46 years old, respectively, at that time. The assistant registrar fixed the multiplier at ten years for the father and 12 years for the mother, citing, inter alia, statistics published by the Ministry of Health which showed that the average life expectancy of a Singaporean male at the time of the assessment was 77 years while that of a Singaporean female was 81 years.

26    We note that in Tan Ngo Hwa, life expectancy was assumed to be 70 years for each parent (id at [7] and [28]). Such an assumption was impliedly adopted in Ho Yeow Kim, where the Court of Appeal revised the multiplier in respect of the bereaved father from seven years to ten years in view of the decision in Tan Ngo Hwa (see [24] above). In comparison, in 2002, when the fatal accident that gave rise to the present appeals took place, life expectancy for male residents in Singapore was 76.8 years and the corresponding figure for female residents in Singapore was 80.6 years (see Singapore Department of Statistics, Yearbook of Statistics Singapore 2003 at p 10). A longer life expectancy is a factor that, in our view, could justify a slightly higher multiplier being applied than that adopted in previous analogous cases, all other things being equal. We therefore endorse the assistant registrar’s reasoning in Lee Kwan Kok (in taking into account life expectancy when determining the appropriate multiplier), but with two important qualifications: first, life expectancy should be considered as at the date of the accident, and not at the date of the assessment of damages hearing; and, second, it must be borne in mind that life expectancy remains but one factor in what is essentially a multivariate equation. Therefore, if a case that is analogous to Tan Ngo Hwa were to occur today (ie, assuming that the fatal accident takes place in 2008), a one-year increase in the multiplier for the father and the mother of the deceased to nine years and 11 years, respectively, would be eminently reasonable and justifiable if there are no other countervailing factors. Similarly, in today’s context, a multiplier of 11 years instead of ten years for each parent of the deceased son in Ho Yeow Kim would not necessarily be an aberration if the court at first instance finds that the facts support a higher multiplier.

27    We have decided, in the context of the present appeals, to fix the multiplier at eight years for the first appellant and 13 years for the second appellant. The first appellant was 46 years old at the time of Gurjiv’s and Pardip’s deaths. We are of the view that eight years, which is the same multiplier as that applied to the father of the deceased in Tan Ngo Hwa, is reasonable. The first appellant can continue working for another decade or so until he is at least 62 years old, barring any contingencies. Taking into account a discount for the vicissitudes of life and, more particularly, payment upfront, we think it is reasonable to expect that, after his retirement, the first appellant would have sought eight years of financial support from Gurjiv and Pardip had they not died in the accident.

28    The second appellant was 44 years old when her sons died. Taking into account the baseline multiplier of eight years which we have decided on for the first appellant (see [27] above), a multiplier of 13 years for the second appellant is, in our view, justified given her longer life expectancy as well as her greater need for financial support from her sons (she has not worked since 1988, after Pardip was born).

The sums to be awarded to the appellants for loss of dependency

29    In the circumstances, we vary the AR’s awards for loss of dependency to provide for a multiplier of eight years in respect of the first appellant and 13 years in respect of the second appellant. Since the second appellant has not worked for a long time, we apportion 65% of the sons’ total monthly contribution to her for the first eight years of dependency (the assumption being that the first appellant would no longer be working during this period, but would still have some means of supporting the second appellant, for example, by way of his Central Provident Fund savings). For the next five years, we apportion to the second appellant 75% of the sons’ total monthly contribution (the assumption being that she would be on her own during this later period). We set out the necessary calculations as follows:

30    We should emphasise that the very unfortunate events that gave rise to the present appeals presented a factual matrix that is uncommon (arguably, even unique). As a result, the considerations which we have taken into account in deciding on the appropriate sums to award the appellants for loss of dependency – including the appellants’ sudden loss of both of their sons in the same accident and the concomitant loss of all prospects of financial support from either of their two children, as well as the highly unlikely prospect of the appellants having another child in the future – are specific to these appeals, and the sums which we have ultimately decided on cannot be regarded as setting new benchmarks for future cases. Indeed, it is clear that, in this particular area of the law, no one decision can, in any event, be generally regarded as setting firm guidelines or benchmarks as every case turns on its facts (see also, for example, Tan Ngo Hwa ([17] supra) at [28]).

The claim for post-traumatic shock and depression

The test for establishing a duty of care

31    This court recently re-examined, in some detail, the applicable law in Singapore in respect of claims for damages for psychiatric illness or nervous shock (collectively referred to as “psychiatric harm”) sustained as a result of the defendant’s negligence (see Ngiam Kong Seng v Lim Chiew Hock [2008] 3 SLR 674 (“Ngiam”)). In that case, we elaborated upon how claims for psychiatric harm should be analysed within the framework of the two-stage test that this court laid down in Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency [2007] 4 SLR 100 (“Spandeck”) for determining whether a duty of care in tort exists (“the Spandeck test”).

32    Where a claim in negligence for psychiatric harm is concerned, just as in the case of a negligence claim that does not involve psychiatric harm, certain prerequisites must be met before the question of whether a duty of care exists becomes relevant. First, the type of injury suffered must be a “recognisable psychiatric [illness]” (per Lord Bridge of Harwich in McLoughlin v O’Brian [1983] 1 AC 410 (“McLoughlin”) at 431); and, second, it must have been factually foreseeable that the plaintiff could sustain psychiatric harm as a result of the defendant’s negligence. With those preconditions in place, the Spandeck test would then apply, in relation to claims for psychiatric harm, as follows:

(a)   at the first stage, the court considers whether there was sufficient legal proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant at the material time, with the three factors set out by Lord Wilberforce in McLoughlin at 422 playing an important role at this stage of the inquiry; and

(b)   at the second stage, the court considers whether there are any public policy factors that militate against the court imposing a duty of care on the defendant even though the first stage of the Spandeck test has been satisfied inasmuch as it has been established that sufficient proximity existed between the plaintiff and the defendant.

33    As we explained in Ngiam (at [47], [48] and [57]), the “three elements inherent in any claim” (per Lord Wilberforce in McLoughlin at 422) for psychiatric harm, as distilled by the learned law lord in that case (ibid), relate to the issue of proximity between the parties and are thus applied under stage one of the Spandeck test. In summary, these three elements or specific “proximities” are:

(a)   the class of persons whose claims should be recognised by virtue of relational ties;

(b)   the proximity of such persons, in terms of space and time, to the event which is alleged to have caused psychiatric harm; and

(c)   the means by which the shock is caused.

Stage two of the Spandeck test is confined to pure public policy considerations, or what Lord Wilberforce referred to (in McLoughlin at 421) as the “policy arguments against a wider extension” of liability.

Whether the second respondent owed the appellants a duty of care

34    An application of the Spandeck test (as set out at [32] above) to the appellants’ claim for damages for post-traumatic shock and depression has led us to affirm both the AR’s and the Judge’s decisions (which were arrived at on different grounds) that this particular head of claim must be dismissed. This is despite our deep sympathy for the appellants, given the devastating loss that they have suffered.

35    We have no doubt that the appellants experienced, and are continuing to experience, grief of a magnitude that is unimaginable to persons who are not in their position. We note that on the referral of a doctor at Singapore Airport Terminal Servi",30/5/2008 0:00,SG Court of Appeal
