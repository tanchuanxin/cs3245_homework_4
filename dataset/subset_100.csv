ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Jurisdiction of
the court—Question which could be raised by way of appeal.

The appellant, charged with possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, elected for trial before judge and
jury. After a preliminary hearing, he was cited to trial before the Court of
the Queen’s Bench. Afterwards, an indictment was preferred by the Attorney
General of Canada in terms identical to those in the original information
charging him and his trial proceeded before Mayrand J. in the Court of the
Sessions of the Peace. The appellant, convicted and sentenced to fourteen years
of imprisonment, launched an appeal and a petition for writ of habeas
corpus. The Court of Appeal having dismissed the appeal on the merits, this
Court granted the application for leave to appeal from that decision. That
appeal will be heard at a later date. The only issue now before this Court is
the petition for habeas corpus which had been dismissed by the Superior
Court and the Court of Appeal. Nolan J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
Court of Appeal, stated that “a petition for writ of habeas corpus does
not lie in the circumstances of this case: Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960]
S.C.R. 431; In re Richard Darby, [1964] S.C.R. 64; Sanders v.
The Queen (1920), 2 C.C.C. 57. All the allegations concerning the
alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace could
have been raised by way of appeal”.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec
affirming the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing a petition for habeas
corpus. Appeal dismissed.

by

MARTLAND J.—The legal issues raised on the
application for habeas corpus will be before this Court on the
appellant’s appeal, leave for which has been granted. In these circumstances,
we agree with the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal by Nolan J.A. in
dismissing the appellant’s appeal to that Court in respect of his petition for habeas
corpus. The appeal is dismissed and also the appellant’s application for a
writ of certiorari.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offences and sentence
The applicant was tried in the District Court of New South Wales before Huggett DCJ and a jury from 16 - 24 April 2013 upon two counts as follows:

Count 1: Recklessly cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900 and in the alternative,

Count 2: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59 Crimes Act 1900.

2The jury acquitted upon the first count and convicted upon the second. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 15 June 2011.

3The applicant initially appealed against conviction only on the following grounds:

Ground 1: The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported by the evidence and/or

Ground 2: The jury has adopted an inappropriate line of reasoning in seeking to differentiate between the elements of the two counts, when upon the evidence, there was no basis to do so, and there has been a miscarriage of justice accordingly.

4During the course of oral argument, the applicant was granted leave to amend his Grounds of Appeal to add an additional ground by way of seeking leave to appeal against sentence as follows:

Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances generally and in particular:

(i) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the assault involved the injury to the victim's eye; and/or

(ii) Her Honour erred in not finding the offence was constituted by the admitted punch to the rear of the victim's head resulting in a haematoma and/or

(iii) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the injury (to the eye) was caused by an object in the applicant's hand.

5Since the conviction grounds of appeal raise issues of fact, it is necessary for the applicant to obtain the leave of the Court in order to pursue these grounds. Because the grounds of appeal do raise arguable issues, I would grant that leave.

The Crown and defence cases

6It was the Crown case that the applicant and the victim were inmates at the Outer Metropolitan Multi-Purpose Correctional Centre (OMPC) on 15 March 2011. They were working in the laundry. The victim saw the applicant spraying some cigarette bumpers (cigarette butts) with Mortein and putting dirty underwear in the locker that belonged to Mr Morris, another inmate. The victim confronted the applicant about this. In response the applicant hit the victim on the back of the head and as the victim turned around, the applicant punched his eye. It was the Crown case that the applicant was holding a sharp object at the time and that this perforated the victim's eye. The victim was taken to hospital where the eye was removed.

7It was the applicant's case that he tried to play a prank on Mr Morris. The victim saw him and approached him about it. The victim started a physical altercation with him and hit him in the face. While they were scuffling another inmate, Mr Lee, came up and tried to separate them. Mr Lee was holding a pen. The victim was injured and went down onto the ground holding his eye. The applicant punched him in the head and then went outside the laundry. The applicant denied stabbing the victim in the eye.

Factual Background
The Victim

8The victim gave evidence that in March 2011 he was working in the laundry of the OMPC. On the day of the incident, there were about 15 inmates working there. One of those was a Mr Morris whom he had befriended. Mr Morris used to collect bumpers and would roll them up into cigarettes to smoke.

9The victim said that he saw the applicant spraying Mortein on the bumpers in the ashtrays in the laundry at about 10.30am and at about 12.30pm he saw the applicant putting dirty underwear in Mr Morris' locker. The victim said that he challenged the applicant and said ""Leave Red [Mr Morris] alone. Pick on someone your own size."" He said that the applicant made a dismissive response but when he turned away, the applicant hit him twice in the back of the head. The victim said that as he turned around, the applicant ""lunged at him with his hand, with his fist closed, there was something hanging out the end, and hit him in the right eye with it"". The victim said that the item in his fist was silver and metal. He felt excruciating pain and went straight to the toilet. He then became aware that he had blood on his face, looked in the mirror and saw that he had a cut in his eye. The victim was taken to the clinic by a correctional officer.

10The victim told the officer that he fell over and hit his head on a table. He said this because he did not want to be labelled a ""dog"". He told the people in the clinic that he fell over. He was taken in an ambulance to the Nepean Hospital. After 15 minutes he was transferred to the Westmead Hospital where he underwent surgery. In the ward after surgery, the victim told Mr Jones, a corrective services officer, that he had been hit in the back of the head and hit in the eye by the applicant.

11The victim knew an inmate called Mr Lee. Mr Lee also worked in the laundry. The victim said that Mr Lee was not near him when he was hit by the applicant. Before the assault, he said that he last saw Mr Morris outside smoking near the back roller door of the laundry. Later, the victim described the object in the applicant's hand as ""a sharp long object that was in his hand"". He denied that he had challenged the applicant to a fight. He denied that he had spoken to Mr Morris after he returned from the hospital and denied that he had tried to influence Mr Morris in any way.

12In cross-examination the victim denied that he was really angry and had challenged the applicant. He said that the hit to the back of his head was very hard. He said that he was dazed by it. He saw something sticking out of the applicant's fist but did not know how far out. The victim said that his nose was not hit and the fist went straight to his eye. The injury was to the white part of the eye between the pupil and the edge of his nose. He denied that Mr Lee stepped in between him and the applicant to break up the fight.

13Later in the cross-examination the victim agreed that he had not mentioned that the object in the applicant's hand was silver or that it was metallic before the trial. He agreed that approximately a week after the incident when making a statement to the police he said that the weapon was definitely not a pen. By that time he had heard some rumours around the prison that Mr Lee had stabbed him with a pen. He did not tell the police anything about it being metallic or a silver object at that time. He did not tell the police that it was shaped like a key. He agreed that until he gave evidence in the trial, he had not described the object. He agreed that he did not know what object had hit his eye.

14He was cross-examined as to what he had told the corrections officer at the Nepean Hospital. The victim said he could not remember the detail of what he had said but agreed that he did not tell the officer about a weapon being used by the applicant. The victim agreed that when he spoke to officer Fraser-Jones at Westmead Hospital he did not tell him that the object was metallic or a key, nor did he describe it as 6 - 7 centimetres long.

15The victim denied that he had sought to influence Mr Morris or bribe him by offering him drugs and by offering to provide him with a residential address so that he was better able to obtain parole.

Mr Morris

16Mr Morris gave evidence. His evidence in chief was as follows: On the day of the incident he was working in the laundry but stated that he did not recall seeing anything happen between the applicant and the victim in March 2011. He had lied to the police and most of what he told them in his interview with them was a lie. He lied to help out a friend. He lied when he told the police that the applicant had hit the victim from behind and that he had a key.

17Mr Morris was then cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act 1995 in relation to the statement which he had made to the police. Mr Morris agreed that he was concerned about the other inmates knowing that he had spoken to the police because they did not approve of anyone giving evidence as a prosecution witness. He said that he knew that the victim was defending him and that he wanted to do the right thing but still denied seeing the applicant hit the victim.

18When Mr Morris was shown a DVD of his recorded police interview he said that it was all made up because he wanted to assist the victim. He agreed that he smoked bumpers and that he regularly collected them from other inmates.

19When cross-examined on behalf of the applicant, Mr Morris said that he did not see the actual fight and that he was coached on what to say to the police by the victim and other people. He said that he was friendly with both the victim and the applicant. He said that the applicant did not put any pressure on him and no-one had threatened him on behalf of the applicant. He said that he had been offered inducements if he said the ""right thing"" to the police. He said that he was not told to tell the police about a key. That was just something that he heard from others.

Mr Lee

20Mr Lee gave the following evidence. He was in his mid to late sixties in March 2011 and worked in the laundry at the OMPC five days a week. He knew the applicant because they were in the same wing, but they were not friends. He did not know the victim. He was sitting outside the laundry at the time of the incident. He knew that something had happened because people told him about it. After the incident there was a muster and he spoke to the police and told them that he did not see the incident. He told the police that he did not assault the victim. 

21Evidence was given by correctional officers Bristow, Moorhouse, Greenfield, Szegedi, Silvano, Fraser-Jones, Robinson and Hooker. Their evidence did not advance the Crown case significantly. Officer Bristow was in the laundry when the incident occurred but did not see it. When he spoke to the victim, he was told that he fell. He and other correctional services officers did not believe that story and the inmates in the laundry at the time were mustered and searched, as was the laundry area. 

22Officer Moorhouse conducted a more detailed search of the laundry on the day following the incident and found a piece of melted biro in the bin outside the toilets. It was not concealed in the bin. He did not see any blood on the biro. It looked like a pen that had been through the dryer. He said that fly spray was kept in his office and he did not recall the applicant asking for fly spray on 15 March 2011. He said that when the inmates were mustered, all that the search found was a paper towel with blood on it in a bin in the toilet area. This was not the same bin where the biro was located.

23Officer Greenfield said that she spoke to the victim who told her that he had fallen. When she spoke to the applicant on the day of the incident, she noticed that he had a mark on his face. She arranged for him to be strip searched and locked up. His clothes were removed in case they were required for evidence. She thought the mark on the applicant's face was consistent with him being in a fight. She agreed that he was strip searched and segregated because she suspected that he might have been involved in a fight with the victim. 

24Officer Szegedi gave evidence about how keys were kept in the gaol. He said that each inmate had a key for their cell and that they generally kept it with them when they were not in the cells. He said that each key had the cell number printed on it and that there were two keys per cell in case one got lost. The inmates were just given a key and not a key ring. They could choose to wear it on a chain, keep it in their pocket or just leave it in their cell. The dimensions of the key were about 6.5 cms long, 9 mms wide, with the top of the key being about 2.8 cms wide. The narrowest point on the key which opened the lock was about 5 mms and the broadest part of the point was about 8 - 9 mms. He was not able to say when the inmates were searched but the keys or pens would not have been regarded as weapons. 

25Officer Silvano was told by the victim that he hit his face on the corner of a bench in the laundry. He also saw the applicant and noticed some redness on his face, which the applicant said were allergies.

26Officer Fraser-Jones spoke to the applicant in the holding cell where he was kept after the incident. He asked about the mark on his face and the applicant said that he did not know how it got there. On 17 March he was an escort for the victim at Westmead Hospital. According to his notes, it was there that the victim told him that he was assaulted by the applicant.

27By reference to his notes, officer Fraser-Jones said that the victim told him that the appellant was bullying ""Red"" and that he had stood up for him. He told the applicant to stop being a pest and harassing inmates who could not stand up for themselves. He confronted the applicant and then turned away. He then got a heavy knock to the back of the head. He turned around and saw the applicant standing there. He was hit in the eye by the applicant's right hand with an object that he could not identify.

28Officer Robinson said that she spoke to the applicant on 16 March 2011 in the holding cells. She was the Acting Superintendent for the day. The applicant told her that there was evidence in the laundry that would prove his innocence and that he was concerned that it would be destroyed by the inmates if they were allowed into the laundry. He said that there was a blue biro that was used to stab the victim in the bin in the toilet area. He also said that Mr Lee from F Unit was the assailant. The applicant then told her ""off the record"" that he got into a fight with the victim and that Mr Lee yelled and said that he was going to help and then he saw Mr Lee with the pen. He did not see Mr Lee stab the victim.

29Dr Kerdraon was an ophthalmologist. When the victim was admitted to the Nepean Hospital there was an open wound to his eyeball. He observed a small 3 mm L-shaped wound on the nasal side of the white of the eye. His evidence was that the injury would have been caused by a sharp object and that it was unlikely that a fist could have caused it. He was shown a photograph of a key and said that the key was more likely to have caused the injury than the pen casing.

30In cross-examination Dr Kerdraon agreed that 5 - 6 mm, being the width of the key, was longer than the wound in the victim's eye. He said that the sharp object need not be an L-shape itself. He said that with the skin of the eye stretching, the object could have been about 4 mm wide. He agreed that the size of the cut did not tell much about the force that was used to cause the injury. He agreed that the history, which the victim gave to another doctor, was:

""Allegedly assaulted with a single punch to the right eye, falling backwards, hitting his head in the shower where he sustained swelling and bleeding to the right eye, as well as the loss of vision.""

31Because of the way in which the appeal hearing proceeded, it is necessary to set out in more detail the actual evidence of Dr Kerdraon:

""Q. In your expert opinion what did you consider might have made such a cut?
A. I would expect a sharp instrument, possibly pointy. Not so much a blunt instrument.

Q. So when you say blunt something like a fist, could a fist make that injury?
A. I could never say never.

Q. All right, yes?
A. But unlikely.

Q. Unlikely. So for that injury to occur I think it was described earlier as a penetrating injury, is that suggestive that something has actually gone into the eye?
A. Yes but a blunt injury can also cause an open globe just like a soccer ball being run over by a car can rupture and cause a blunt open injury but that was fairly small and there are certain places, weak spots in the eyeball that a rupture if caused by a punch or blunt injury would tend to break at and that was not one of them.

Q. So if you were asked, based on your assessment, to consider whether it was more likely that the injury you saw would have been caused by something like a key as opposed to, perhaps if the doctor could be given exhibit G, just take a moment doctor to look at what's inside but please don't take it out, and I just want to give you a photograph doctor and then I want to ask you a question. Now I have given you a photograph which is a photograph of a key and I have given you a plastic bag that has the outer casing of a pen, are you able to offer an opinion, in terms of your experience and what you observed, as to which would be more likely to cause the type of injury that you saw?
A. I would probably lean towards the key but only marginally 60/40 sort of --

Q. All right and why do you say that though?
A. Just because the injury was more elongated and the pen I presume, but I could be wrong, the pen had a metal tip at the time.

Q. No?
A. It was only the --

Q. Assume you are looking at the item as it is--
A. All right as is, unlikely then, I'd probably increase those odds to 80/20 to say it was the key, in favour of the key.

Q. And that's because?
A. That's because the key seems to have a sharper edge to it and that's on the scale of the eyeball a fairly blunt instrument, sorry the pen on the scale of the eyeball is a fairly blunt instrument."" (18.4.2013 - T.69-17 - 70.11)

""Q. And I think on the previous occasion it was your opinion, was it not, that the key itself as you look at it, the key part of it had a width of something like half a centimetre, 5 or 6 millimetres, which was in fact longer than the wound you saw or measured in Mr Sharp's eye?
A. That's correct.

Q. So it was wider than the wound itself?
A. That's right.

Q. But of course as you suggested it's possible that the tissue stretched whilst it was being injured?
A. That's correct.

Q. If the tissue stretched whilst it was being injured do you then the next step is to assume that it has come back to its original state after the injury. Is that right?
A. That's right.

Q. So in order for something of this width to cause that injury one must first assume a stretching and then I guess a reversion back to its original state?
A. That's right.

Q. If the skin was stretched as a part of this traumatic injury is it possible that it would have remained in that stretched state?
A. That would - it's variable, so it can - it's somewhat elastic.

Q. Yep?
A. Meaning that it will revert back to its original size, original state, but also it's a laceration which is a part of the tissue that's actually touched and that won't close up.

Q. So it could just as well be that the thing that caused the injury, whatever it was, you've been given a choice of two things, but whatever it was had a width of 3 millimetres. That's also a possibility, isn't it?
A. That's a possibility."" (18.4.2013 - T.71.46 - 72.29)

""Q. But again in order for it to have been a key just like this there had to have been some stretching of the tissue. Is that right?
A. Yes, there would've been.

Q. So I come back to my original proposition, sir. If we leave aside those variables, the assumption that there was some stretching and then the tissue came back to its original size, those two steps, if you left them out, if that didn't occur, the key you see here is too big to have caused that injury, isn't it?
A. If there were no stretching of the tissues?

Q. Yes?
A. That's correct.

...

Q. Can you tell the angle at which the sharp implement that caused this injury hit the eye?
A. No.

Q. Can you tell whether it was a puncture or a slicing motion that did it?
A. No.

Q. It could well have been more of a slicing motion?
A. It could have been.

Q. So going forwards and slightly sideways at the point of impact?
A. Possibly.

...

Q. The eyeball, if I could just take a step back, is a very thin piece of tissue, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. I think you described a soccer ball as a good analogy. It's a closed unit. It's like a ball?
A. That's right.

Q. Which contains liquid, a jelly-like substance?
A. Amongst other things.

Q. Amongst other things, but it's a closed unit?
A. Yes.

Q. You describe there being a difference between a rupture and a laceration?
A. That's right.

Q. Could you just explain to the members of the jury what that difference is?

... 

A. Sorry. So a laceration implies the use of a sharp instrument to actually make a cut through the tissues of the eye whereas a rupture implies no sharp instrument, just a sudden increase in the pressure of the eyeball that causes it to explode essentially.

Q. So I think you used the analogy of running over a soccer ball. So for the eye it would be something pushing against the eyeball so much so that there was a rupture?
A. That's right.

Q. It blew out?
A. That's right.

Q. So it wasn't that in your opinion?
A. It is not likely to be that, no.

Q. Blunt force trauma can cause injuries that look remarkably like lacerations, can't it?
A. Yes.

Q. Especially if the tissue is in some way forced to fold or back onto itself or pushed in an unusual way?
A. The eyeball is fairly slippery so it would be difficult. If you're insinuating that you can fold over the tissue of the eyeball, I think that would be fairly unlikely.

Q. A punch to the eye is quite a great deal of force on the eye, is it not?
A. At what --

Q. A punch to the eye?
A. At what force?

Q. Yeah, is a great deal of force on --
A. A great deal, yes.

Q. And that can result in injuries that look like lacerations?
A. It's always possible, yes.

Q. Was there anything in the look of this injury that allowed you to conclude it was not a laceration - I'm sorry, was not a rupture. I'm sorry about that. 
A. So like, as I said before, I can't be 100 per cent certain that it wasn't a rupture but a rupture tends to occur at specific parts on the eyeball where there are weak spots such as the stitching of the soccer ball and this part where this wound was was not one of those weak spots.

Q. And that's relative to the other parts of the eyeball, is it not?
A. That's right.

Q. But the eyeball itself, what's holding it together is a fairly thin piece of tissue, is it not?
A. Yes."" (18.4.2013 - T.73.11 - 75.37)

""Q. Doctor, you were asked many questions about what may be possible, correct?
A. That's right.

Q. And anything that's not impossible is possible. Is that correct?
A. That's right."" (18.4.2013 - T.79.39)

32Detective Senior Constable Stephen Crimston gave evidence but that evidence did not advance the Crown case beyond that already established by other witnesses.

The Applicant

33The applicant gave evidence in the first trial. That evidence was recorded and the audio recording was played to the jury as Exhibit O during the second trial. The applicant said that he used to work in the laundry at OMPC, operating the washing machines. He knew the victim and he knew inmates Morris and Lee. He had assisted Mr Lee to move from H Wing where he was unhappy, to F Wing. After that Mr Lee used to cook him meals and they were friends.

34On 15 March 2011 he tried to play a prank on Mr Morris by putting some female underwear from a nursing home in his locker which was in the kitchen area. The victim saw what he had done and a verbal exchange occurred between them. He walked out of the kitchen area but when he looked back he saw that the victim was following him.

35The applicant described what then occurred as follows: the victim approached him and said ""Do you want to have a go do you?"" and then hit him on the right side of his face. He grabbed the victim's hands and they struggled. He hit the victim on his left cheek and they continued to wrestle. Mr Lee then came up on the applicant's right side and he was holding a pen. Mr Lee tried to separate them. He pushed Mr Lee away against the wall and looked at the victim and noticed that he was ""going down"" and holding his right eye. When he was going down, he hit the victim twice in the back of the head and then walked outside. He did not see Mr Lee stab the victim with the pen. He did not have a pen of his own, or any other stabbing implement. He did not stab the victim in the eye. 

36The applicant said that following the fight, he and other inmates were brought together for a muster. He was separated from the other inmates, strip searched and taken to a holding cell. Nothing was removed from him during the search. His injuries included a swollen eye and some marks on his arms and chest.

37In cross-examination the applicant said that he saw Mr Lee holding a black biro in his right hand. He denied that he ""invented this story to involve Mr Lee in the fight"". He was intimidated by the victim because the victim was much heavier than him. Even though he was scared of the victim, he responded to his taunt in the kitchen because he would have appeared ""weak"" had he not done so. He agreed that in gaol the inmates like to sort things out between themselves and not involve the correctional officers. He agreed that Mr Morris was younger than most of the other inmates and also smaller.

38He denied spraying Mortein on the bumpers and said it was not a low act to put the underwear in Mr Morris' locker. He said it was a joke because they were friends. He denied bullying Mr Morris. He denied that Mr Lee was vulnerable, or that he was a convenient fall guy. 

39The applicant did not have his key with him on the day of the fight. He did not lock his cell as he was in a privileged wing and no-one would steal from his wing. When the cells were locked, they could easily be opened with a butter knife. He denied having anything sharp in his hands or striking the victim with anything sharp. He denied hitting the victim in the back of the head. Mr Lee did not say anything when he was trying to break up the fight but he had a frantic look on his face. He did not tell the truth to the officers about the red marks on his face because he did not want them to think that he had been in a fight.

Mr Wu

40Mr Wu gave evidence in the applicant's case. He knew Mr Lee as they had been in other gaols together. He was housed in F Wing with the applicant and Mr Lee. He understood that the applicant had assisted Mr Lee in moving to F Wing. Mr Wu used to work in the laundry as a folder and he knew Mr Morris and the victim. Mr Lee was the storeman and he counted the stock in the laundry. He used to write down figures on a piece of A4 paper with a pen. When he was not using his pen, he would put it in the pocket of his jacket.

41Mr Wu said that on 15 March 2011 he and the applicant were teasing Mr Morris and calling him ""a bum"" because he used to pick up cigarettes from the floor. He did not see the applicant spray Mortein on the cigarette butts and he did not see him put underwear in Mr Morris' locker. He never saw the applicant lock or unlock his cell with a key. He could not remember if he ever saw the applicant wearing his key around his neck.

42Mr Wu said that when the incident occurred, he was outside the laundry. He heard the victim say ""Why don't you pick on someone your own size?"" and he made reference to ""Red"". The applicant then called the victim a ""fat cunt"". They continued to verbally abuse each other and then it became physical. They said ""Let's have a go"" and walked inside the front of the storeroom. There were punches being thrown by both of them. He saw that Mr Lee was on the right side of the inmates who were fighting. Mr Lee was trying to get between them. The applicant had his fist clenched, but he could not see if he was holding anything. When the applicant walked out, Mr Wu saw his hands and there was no blood anywhere, nor did he see the applicant holding anything.

43In cross-examination Mr Wu said that when he was talking to Mr Lee in the yard, Mr Lee used to say ""If anyone messed with me, he'd stab them with a pin"". Mr Wu said that he had a good view and watched the incident unfold. He did not see the victim fall down after the incident and he did not see blood on his face or see a tissue on his face. He denied that the applicant was a good friend of his but that he was just an associate. Mr Lee was not a good friend of his, but he remembered that Mr Lee used to have three or four pens in his pocket because it was boring in gaol. Mr Morris could not afford to buy cigarettes because he used his money for drugs. Mr Wu thought it was disgusting to pick up cigarette butts from the floor and he found it very funny. He agreed that when the applicant sprayed water on the floor, it made the butts useless to Mr Morris.

44By way of further background, it is necessary to deal with a question received from the jury during their deliberations. The jury note (MFI 13) read:

""What is the relationship between the allegations in count 2 and the elements? That is, the elements do not refer to something in his hand.""

After discussing the matter with counsel, her Honour responded to the jury as follows:

""Can I say this, members of the jury, you have before you the document that contains the elements for count 1 and the elements for count 2. And none of the elements for either count 1 or count 2 contain or include an element involving something in the accused's hand, the elements are as per this document. 

The Crown's case and the evidence of David Sharp [the victim] was that there was something in the accused's hand but the elements are as per the document that you have been provided with. So all I can say is if you focus on the evidence and the way the Crown's run its case, we are not talking about theoretical possibilities here. The evidence is what is before you and I have told you not to speculate and not to guess and matters of that sort, so if you focus on the elements in the document that has been provided to you, that is what the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt.""

45In order to understand that direction, it is also necessary to set out her Honour's directions as to the elements of the offences. In relation to count 1, her Honour said:

""The elements that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted of Count 1 are as follows. 

(1) That the accused cause grievous bodily harm to David Sharp. The words ""grievous bodily harm"" mean really serious bodily injury. Such injury need not be permanent, but it must be more than trivial or trifling. There is no dispute in this trial that David Sharp did in fact suffer grievous bodily harm as a result of an incident that occurred in the laundry on 15 March 2011.

...

The second element that the Crown must prove in relation to Count 1 is that the accused was reckless. 

...

Grievous bodily harm is caused recklessly, and this is referred to on your document, if the accused realised that grievous bodily harm may possibly be inflicted upon David Sharp by his actions yet he went ahead and acted as he did anyway. 

...

The accused cannot be found to have acted recklessly unless the Crown proves that he actually thought about the consequences of his act and at least realised the possibility of grievous bodily harm occurring.""

46In relation to count 2, her Honour's directions were:

""The elements or ingredients that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt before you can convict the accused of Count 2 are as follows. Firstly, that the accused was the person who assaulted David Sharp. Obviously you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused as opposed to any other person such as Anthony Lee who assaulted David Sharp.

There are four elements which constitute an assault. They are:

(a) a striking or a touching or the use of force by the accused to another person. 

(b) That such conduct of the accused was without the consent of the complainant, Mr Sharp.

(c) That such conduct was intentional or reckless in the sense that the accused realised that David Sharp might be subject to immediate and unlawful violence, however slight, as a result of what he or she was about to do but took the risk anyway and went ahead. 

(d) That such conduct was without lawful excuse. 

There is no dispute here at all that to punch someone in the eye whether with something in your hand or not is an assault. There is no issue that it was unwanted. The real issue is whether it was the accused who did this as opposed to any other person such as Anthony Lee.""

47When the jury delivered its verdict and her Honour sought to reconcile their reasoning between count 1 and count 2, she did so as follows:

""Given the jury's resolution of the issue regarding identity in a manner adverse to the offender in Count 2, the jury's verdict of not guilty to Count 1 indicates either that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the loss of the eye, constituted grievous bodily harm, a scenario which I reject, or the jury was not sufficiently satisfied that when the offender inflicted the injury to the victim's right eye that he acted recklessly. That is, the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender realised that grievous bodily harm may have possibly been inflicted to the victim by his actions.""

Conviction Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1 - The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported by the evidence and/or

Ground 2 - The jury has adopted an inappropriate line of reasoning in seeking to differentiate between the elements of the two counts, when upon the evidence there was no basis to do so, there has been a miscarriage of justice accordingly.

48Although Ground 1 is expressed in terms of the verdict of the jury being ""unsafe and unsatisfactory and incapable of being supported by the evidence"", the applicant accepted that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was him and not Mr Lee who inflicted the injury on the victim. The real gravamen of the grounds of appeal is that once the jury had reached that conclusion, there was no rational basis in the evidence for the jury to acquit on Ground 1 but convict on Ground 2. The applicant submitted that the overwhelming inference was that the jury engaged in an impermissible line of reasoning and delivered a compromise verdict. The applicant submitted that it was in that way that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and could not be supported by the evidence. 

49The applicant submitted that support for that ground of appeal emerged from the way in which the Crown put its case, i.e. that the only real issue was the identity of the person who injured the victim's eye.

50In that regard, the applicant called in aid the warning given to the jury by the trial judge:

""It would be quite wrong of you to find the accused guilty of count 2 simply because you could not all agree on the same verdict for count 1.""

51In making that submission, the applicant properly accepted that a jury is permitted to determine for itself what it considers to be the issues, quite apart from those determined by the parties and the trial judge, but that it can only give substance to such a consideration if there is evidence properly before it. The applicant did not challenge in any way the directions given by the trial judge as to the elements of the offences raised by the two counts.

52The applicant put the same submission in a slightly different way. He asked (rhetorically) whether there was any evidence to differentiate between the mental element in count 1 and the mental element in count 2. If there were no proper basis for such differentiation, he submitted that the jury must have had a doubt about whether it was the applicant who struck the victim in the eye or whether he struck the victim in the eye with an object and either way, there was no proper basis for the jury to convict him on count 2 as opposed to count 1. He submitted that in order to do so the jury must have engaged in an inappropriate process of reasoning and that there had been a resulting miscarriage of justice.

53The applicant submitted that at trial his counsel at no time submitted to the jury that if he was the person who stabbed the victim in the eye with an object, he might have done so without the requisite intent. The applicant submitted that this was because such a submission was not available in the circumstances. The applicant submitted that if he had stabbed the victim in the eye with an object, it was obvious in the circumstances that he must have done so with at least the realisation of the risk of serious injury.

54In that regard, the applicant submitted that her Honour's attempt to reconcile the jury's verdict, (i.e. that the finding of guilt on the second count meant that the jury were not satisfied as to the mental element necessary to establish the first count) was simply not available on the evidence. The applicant submitted that such a distinction was not open despite the fact that the Crown had made a submission to that effect at trial when in the course of his address, the Crown said:

""If you have something sticking out of your fist and you punched someone in the face in the area of the eye, you realise the possibility that you can cause really serious harm but he continued nevertheless. And as you know Mr Sharp did suffer really serious harm. Members of the jury, the Crown submits when you carefully consider the evidence, you would be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the first count on the indictment. If you have some concern about Mr McKay's state of mind but you're satisfied he punched Mr Sharp in the face causing the injury, then you will move on to count 2 and you were told and no doubt would be reminded the Crown must prove that he struck him as a result of which actual bodily harm was occasioned. No doubt the injuries, more than actual bodily harm, so if you accept that Mr McKay struck him in the face and you don't accept that he realised the possibility of what kind of injury could be imposed but nevertheless accept that he did, than you would return a verdict of guilty in relation to the alternative count."" (23.4.13 - T.37.25 - .39)

Consideration

55Because the first ground of appeal is expressed in the way in which it is, it is necessary to say something about that ground in its terms. It was common ground that the relevant principles as to how a Court of Criminal Appeal should approach the question was set out by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The guidance there provided by their Honours was:

""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal


11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

... 

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""

56There is no issue that there was evidence to support the jury's finding that it was the applicant who struck a blow to the victim's right eye. There was conflicting evidence. The evidence in support of the Crown case was that of the victim, the statement made by Mr Morris to the police and in a negative sense, the denial of any involvement by Mr Lee. The applicant's case consisted of his evidence and that of Mr Wu. This was not one of those cases where a Court of Criminal Appeal could take into account objective evidence, or inherent improbabilities or probabilities arising from the evidence. The only independent evidence was that of the ophthalmologist, Dr Kerdraon, and even that evidence was not unequivocal.

57This trial involved issues of credit which were fundamentally for the jury to determine. This Court has not had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. Suffice it to say that on a proper analysis of the evidence, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck the victim in the right eye. It follows that looked at on its own and in its terms, ground 1 has not been made out.

58The next issue is whether there was a rational basis for the jury's acquittal of the applicant of the offence in count 1 and their conviction for the offence in count 2.

59Assistance is provided by the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in Mackenzie v R [1996] HCA35; 190 CLR 348 at 366:

""3. Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. A judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone is often cited as expressing the test:


""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand.""


4. Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries. The early history of New South Wales was affected by English juries which, in the face of clear evidence, declined to find the value of goods stolen sufficient to attract the punishment of death, thereby affording to the offender the alternative punishment of transportation. Australian decisions have acknowledged that the role of the jury continues to be ameliorative in this respect. In R v Kirkman, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, King CJ (with the concurrence of Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ) observed:

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""

We agree with these practical and sensible remarks.


5. Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ""It all depends upon the facts of the case"".""

60In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 the plurality (Gleeson CJ; Hayne and Callinan JJ) made observations to similar effect:

""33 In MacKenzie v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated a number of general propositions concerning the significance that may properly be attached to what is sometimes referred to as factual inconsistency between verdicts. In that respect, it is to be noted that, where an accused is charged with multiple offences, differences between the verdicts may not, in truth, involve inconsistencies even of a factual kind. In the present case, if there had been a verdict of guilty on count 2 and not guilty on count 3, where the charges were supported by substantially the same evidence, then there would have been factual, even though not technical or legal, inconsistency. However, the evidence in support of counts 7 and 8 was materially different from the evidence in relation to counts 1 to 6 and count 9. The complainant was, to a significant extent, supported by MA.

34 Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in Mackenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.

35 It appears from the review of decisions of trial judges and intermediate appellate courts undertaken in Markuleski that some judges have taken Jones as authority for the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant, then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. That view is erroneous. It overlooks the attention to factual detail in the reasoning of Jones. It also overlooks the principles stated in MacKenzie, which were not qualified in Jones, and the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph in these reasons. Jones is not to be understood as establishing a set of legal propositions, separate or different from the test formulated in M, which must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

36 The test established by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is unreasonableness, not inconsistency. In the present case, there is an obvious explanation of the differences between the verdicts on the various counts in the indictment. ...""

61Applying those principles, can the acquittal on count 1 and the conviction on count 2 be explained on the basis put forward by the Crown in its final submission and as explained by her Honour in her remarks on sentence - i.e., that the jury were not satisfied as to the mental element in ground 1, on the basis that the jury did not accept that the applicant realised that grievous bodily harm might possibly be inflicted on the victim, if he struck him in the right eye with an object in his fist. In my opinion it can. The reasoning would be that the jury thought that in the context of what seems to have been a fight between the applicant and the victim, where the victim was a very large person, no thought was given by the applicant to the possibility of serious harm being inflicted on the victim's eye. 

62On the evidence it was open to the jury to see a distinction between an assault with the deliberate use of a weapon against the eye, which would have sustained count 1, and an assault in which the applicant was holding an object but did not deliberately direct it at the victim's eye. There was no suggestion in the victim's evidence that the applicant took up an object by way of weapon for the purpose of hitting the victim with it. The victim's evidence went no further than that there was something hanging out from the end of the applicant's fist when he was struck.

63The jury could well have entertained a reasonable doubt about the applicant's state of mind concerning the possibility of grievous bodily harm while accepting the victim's evidence that the applicant was in fact holding an object in his hand at the time he punched him.

64Alternatively, the jury may not have been satisfied that the applicant had anything in his fist when he punched the victim. That this was a concern of the jury appears from the question which they asked. Their concern was not without a basis. The evidence of the victim from when he first disclosed that he had been struck in the eye by the applicant up to the time of trial, was that he thought the applicant had something in his hand but he did not know what it was. The more detailed description which suggested a key came from the victim for the first time at trial. There was otherwise no evidence at all that a key was involved, except for the fact that each inmate had access to a key. The evidence as to a biro shell (as distinct from an intact biro with a sharp point) was based on a rumour in the gaol and the finding of a biro case in the laundry bin. Testing of the biro case showed no trace of blood. Accordingly, there was no clear evidence as to what, if anything, the applicant had in his hand when he struck the victim in the right eye.

65The victim's evidence was that he was struck a hard blow to the head which caused him to turn around, at which time he was struck in the right eye. There was no suggestion in the evidence that when the first blow was struck, there was anything in the applicant's hand. If it be the case that the applicant had something in his hand, he must have obtained it or placed it there between the time of the first blow and that of the second. The time between the two blows seems to have been very short and that may well have been a matter that the jury took into account.

66Finally, the medical evidence was not decisive. Dr Kerdraon thought it more likely than not that a sharp object had caused the wound to the eye, but he could not exclude the biro case or a heavy punch. When one has regard to the unsatisfactory evidence as to the object being a key, the other possibilities which Dr Kerdraon accepted as real, come into play.

67It follows that the jury's verdicts can be rationalised on either of those bases. It was open to the jury to find that the applicant was holding an object but did not deliberately direct it at the victim's eye or alternatively, it was open to the jury to have a doubt as to whether the applicant had any object in his hand at the time he struck the victim in the right eye. Either alternative provided a reasonable basis for an acquittal on count 1 but a conviction on count 2. On that basis, I am not satisfied that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence.
Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances generally and in particular:

(i) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the assault involved the injury to the victim's eye; and/or

(ii) Her Honour erred in not finding the offence was constituted by the admitted punch to the rear of the victim's head resulting in a haematoma; and/or

(iii) Her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the injury (to the eye) was caused by an object in the applicant's hand.

68In relation to the first two particulars of this ground of appeal, the applicant submitted that it was not open to her Honour to reconcile the two verdicts in the way in which she did, nor was it open on the evidence to find that the jury could have had a reasonable doubt that the applicant had an object in his hand when he struck the victim's eye. Accordingly, the only explanation for the jury's verdict was that they did not regard the blow to the eye as the action which constituted the offence in count 2.

69That submission can be quickly dealt with. The blow to the back of the head, other than being described by way of background to the injury to the eye, played no part in any of the contested issues at trial. There were no submissions made in relation to it and it clearly formed no part of the jury's consideration. I have already indicated why it was open to the jury to acquit in relation to count 1 but still find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant caused the injury to the victim's eye. 

70This leaves the third part of this ground for consideration. The applicant submitted that if contrary to his primary position, the Court were satisfied that there was a basis in the evidence for the jury having a reasonable doubt as to whether the applicant had something in his hand when he struck the victim's right eye, it was not open to her Honour to find beyond reasonable doubt that such was the case.

71The precise findings by her Honour are to be found in her remarks on sentence as follows:

""Reacting to this hit the victim turned back around towards where the offender had been standing prior to him, the victim, having turned his back and the offender lunged at the victim with a closed fist and with ""something"" in his hand. The victim was hit once to the area of his right eye."" (ROS 5.5)

""Notwithstanding resolution of this factual issue in the offender's favour, I am nevertheless satisfied that the offender while standing in close proximity to the victim made a deliberate movement toward the victim's face which landed in the area of his right eye and caused the injury to the offender's eye."" (ROS 10.7)

""Based upon the evidence of Dr Kerdraon and the evidence of the victim, I accept beyond reasonable doubt that something was in the offender's hand, although I am unable to determine exactly what that item was."" (ROS 11.5)

72Although her Honour made that finding, she was very conscious of the lesser seriousness of the offence for which the applicant had been convicted. In that regard, her Honour said:

""Of course the offender must not be sentenced for an offence for which he has not been convicted. Nor can I take into account for the purpose of increasing the otherwise appropriate sentence a circumstance that would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence than the one for which the offender stands to be sentenced. Accordingly, the offender must be sentenced on the basis that although he deliberately and intentionally assaulted the victim whilst something was in his fist, he did not intend to cause harm amounting to grievous bodily harm. To make this clear the offender cannot and will not therefore be sentenced on the basis that he recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to the victim which would of course constitute a more serious offence. He cannot and will not be sentenced on the basis he realised the grievous bodily harm may have possibly been inflicted by his actions. The Court must sentence the offender on the basis that the deliberate assault he occasioned to the victim caused injury of an extremely serious kind to the victim's right eye."" (ROS 11.8 - 12.4) 

73As indicated, the jury acting rationally could well have entertained a reasonable doubt about the applicant's state of mind concerning the possibility of grievous bodily harm while accepting the victim's evidence that the applicant was in fact holding an object in his hand at the time he punched the victim. It follows that it was open to her Honour in the sentence proceedings to make that finding beyond reasonable doubt. The fact that there was another rational alternative available to the jury did not preclude her Honour making such a finding. Accordingly, the third part of this ground of appeal has not been made out.

74For the above reasons, in relation to both the conviction appeal and the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

75McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

76GARLING J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

No  appeal  lies  to  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  of  Tasmania  from  the 

HAYNE, HEYDON, CRENNAN, KIEFEL AND BELL JJ.   The Supreme Court 
of Tasmania (Slicer J) ordered that proceedings on an indictment which charged 
the respondents with the reckless operation of an aircraft be stayed.  The Court's 
reasons were delivered on 28 April 2008, the primary judge holding that a ""stay 
of proceedings ought to be granted"".1  The order which was entered on 16 May 
2008 is recorded as ""grants stay of proceedings"".  It is not in issue that the order 
had the effect of permanently staying proceedings on the indictment.  
 
 
The indictment charges the respondents jointly with operating an aircraft 
being reckless as to whether the manner of operation could endanger the life of 
another  person,  contrary  to  ss 20A(1)  and  29  of  the  Civil  Aviation  Act  1988

ground  that  the  primary  judge's  discretion  miscarried  in  that  he  acted  upon  a 
wrong principle and that he took into account irrelevant considerations relating to 
the  suggested  complexity  of  the  trial.    These  submissions  should  be  accepted.  
For the reasons that follow the order staying the proceeding should be set aside.  
 
The Crown case 
 
 
The respondents are airline pilots who were the pilot and first officer of a 
Qantas Boeing 737-400 aircraft on a flight to and from Launceston, which took 
place  during  night  hours  on  23 October  2001.    Each  of  the  respondents  was 
responsible for the operation of the aircraft.  The Crown alleges that the aircraft 
took  off  from  Launceston  Airport  (""the  airport"")  in  darkness,  without  the 
necessary lighting being turned on.  Qantas did not provide scheduled services to 
Launceston.    This  was  a  relief  flight  that  was  arranged  in  order  to  collect 
70 passengers who had been stranded as the result of a mishap.   
 
 
The  control  tower  at  the  airport  was  unmanned  between  the  hours  of 
10.00pm  and  6.00am.    The  apron  and  terminal  lights  at  the  airport  operated 
24 hours  a  day.    The  taxiway,  runway  edge  lights  and  the  illuminated  wind 
direction  indicator  (""IWDI""),  or  windsock  lighting,  (collectively,  ""the  runway

In  the  alternative,  the  respondents  are  charged  with  operating  an  aircraft  being 
reckless  as  to  whether  the  manner  of  operation  could  endanger  the  person  or 
property of another person, contrary to ss 20A(2) and 29 of the Civil Aviation Act 
1988 (Cth).

lighting"") were not illuminated when the control tower was unmanned.  During 
these hours it was the responsibility of pilots arriving at, or departing from, the 
airport to turn on the runway lighting.  This was done with the Pilot Activated 
Lighting  system  (""the  PAL"").    The  PAL  was  activated  by  a  signal  that  was 
transmitted  from  the  aircraft's  radio  to  a  receiving  device  at  the  control  tower.  
Once  activated,  the  runway  lighting  remained  illuminated  for  a  period  of  32 
minutes. 
 
 
The aircraft touched down at the airport at 10.32pm.  Before this a signal 
had been transmitted from the aircraft to the control tower, which had activated 
the  PAL.    Thus  the  runway  lighting  was  on.    The  aircraft  arrived  outside  the 
terminal building at 10.34pm.  The interval between activation of the PAL and 
the aircraft's arrival is not known.  Accordingly, the end of the cycle of runway 
lighting  commenced  by  the  initial  activation  of  the  PAL  cannot  be  determined 
with precision.   
 
 
The  aircraft  moved  from  the  terminal  building  at  11.01pm.    It  travelled 
along  taxiway  A,  instead  of  taxiway  C.    Taxiway  A  was  usually  reserved  for 
smaller aircraft.  It taxied past the Royal Flying Doctor Service (""RFDS"") hangar 
and  prepared  for  take-off  at  11.03pm.    Its  wheels  left  the  runway  at  11.05pm.  
The take-off was observed by Mr Griffiths and Mr Withers, two RFDS pilots, a 
paramedic  and  two  nearby  residents,  Mr Walker,  an  aircraft  enthusiast,  and 
Mr Dergacz, a pilot.   
 
 
Mr Griffiths telephoned the duty  operations  officer at the airport shortly 
after  the  aircraft's  departure  to  enquire  whether  there  was  a  problem  with  the 
operation of the runway lights.  The following day he reported the matter to the 
Civil  Aviation  Safety  Authority  (""CASA"").    Mr Withers  reported  the  matter  to 
the Air Transport Safety Bureau (""ATSB"") on 29 October 2001.   
 
The investigation 
 
 
 
 
On 14 December 2001 CASA appointed an investigator to enquire into the 
incident.    Mr Griffiths,  Mr Withers  and  the  paramedic  made  statements  in  the 
course of the investigation in which they said that the runway lighting was not 
illuminated when they observed the aircraft moving along the taxiway and when 
it took-off.  Mr Walker made a statement saying that he had watched the aircraft 
as it moved along the taxiway and he had noted that the runway lighting was not 
on at that time nor during the aircraft's take-off.  Mr Dergacz made a statement 
saying that he had heard the sound of a jet aircraft rotating from the runway and 

Qantas was first notified of the incident on 9 November 2001.

he had looked out of his window and observed that the runway lights were not 
illuminated.  
 
 
Statements were taken in the course of the investigation from Mr Gomez, 
the duty fire officer at the airport, and from Mr Axon, the maintenance engineer 
on board the aircraft.  Mr Gomez watched the take-off with the use of binoculars.  
He paid attention to the aircraft's engines.  When he was interviewed a few days 
after the incident he was unable to say whether the runway lighting was on or off 
at the relevant time.  Mr Axon was present in the cockpit at the time of the take-
off and had no memory of any unusual occurrence.     
 
 
the 
investigation and each declined to be interviewed.  On 2 January 2002, Qantas 
wrote  to  CASA  advising  that  each  of  the  respondents  had  reported  that  the 
runway lights were activated and operating during the take-off.  On 15 January 
2002,  the  first  respondent  made  a  statutory  declaration  stating  that  the  runway 
lights were illuminated for the departure of the aircraft.  
 
The delays in prosecuting the offences  
 
 
In April 2002 CASA referred the matter to the Commonwealth Director of 
Public  Prosecutions.    For  reasons  that  are  not  explained,  complaints  were  not 
sworn  against  the  respondents  until  30 March  2004.    The  proceedings  came 
before  the  Court  of  Petty  Sessions  on  8 June  2004.    The  respondents  entered 
pleas  of  not  guilty  on  14 September  2004.    The  proceedings  were  listed  for  a 
committal hearing between 28 and 30 June 2005.  These dates were vacated on 
the application of the defence.  The committal hearing was held between 2 and 
4 November 2005.  The respondents were committed for trial.  Delays associated 
with the provision of the transcript followed  thereafter.  The proceedings were 
listed  for  trial  at  the  sittings  of  the  Supreme  Court  commencing  21 November 
2006.  The trial did not proceed at this time apparently as the result of further 
difficulties associated with the provision of a complete transcript.  On 13 March 
2007 the proceedings were adjourned on the application of the defence to allow 
for the submission of a ""no bill"" application.   
 
 
The  application  for  a  stay  came  before  Slicer J  on  26 November  2007.  
The application was based on the loss of ""primary technological evidence"" (""the 
lost evidence"") and on the delay which, it was said, strengthened the ""prejudice"" 
flowing from the lost evidence4.

The lost evidence and the operation of the PAL 
 
 
The lost evidence comprises the electronic record of the activation of the 
PAL made by a Monitor at the airport (""the Monitor List"") and the information 
recorded on the aircraft's flight data recorder (""FDR"").   

 
The Monitor List contained a record of the last 13 activations of the PAL.  
A print-out of the Monitor List was obtained two days after the incident.  This 
only contained records of activations on 24 and 25 October 2001.   

 
The  FDR  recorded  the  keying  of  the  VHF  radio  system,  the  time  of 
transmission  and  its  duration.    It  did  not  identify  the  specific  frequency  or  the 
purpose  of  the  transmission.    Given  the  time  of  night  at  which  the  incident 
occurred  and  the  absence  of  staff  in  the  control  tower,  an  inference  could  be 
drawn from the FDR data that a radio transmission was made in order to activate 
the PAL.  Data recorded on the FDR was overwritten after a time.  The evidence 
established that the information recorded on the FDR during the aircraft's flight 
on 23 October 2001 could have been retrieved within 13 to 15 days of that day.  
 
 
The PAL was activated by the transmission of three pulses on a frequency 
specified by the manufacturer.  Each pulse was required to be between one and 
five  seconds  in  duration  and  it  was  necessary  for  all  three  to  be  transmitted 
within a 25 second span.  Once activated, the PAL  operated for an interval of 
between 30 and 60 minutes depending on the timer setting.  The timer setting at 
the  airport  provided  for  a  period  of  32 minutes  illumination.    The  system  was 
designed to warn of the impending extinguishment of the lights; during the final 
10 minutes of the cycle the IWDI flashed continuously.   
 
 
There  were  two  distinctive  features  of  the  operation  of  the  PAL  at  the 
airport.  First, if the final pulse was transmitted during or after the 25th second, 
the  lighting  cycle  defaulted  to  the  concluding  10 minute  phase,  which  was 
accompanied  by  the  flashing  of  the  primary  IWDI  (""the  straddle  effect"").  
Secondly, Civil Aviation Order 92 required the primary IWDI to be located on 
the left side of the runway, unless this was impractical.  The primary IWDI at the 
airport was positioned on the right side of the runway.  There were two IWDIs at 
the  airport.    Only  the  southern  IWDI  was  configured  to  flash  during  the 
concluding phase of the PAL cycle.  The northern IWDI, which was closer to the 
terminal, remained constantly alight throughout the PAL cycle.  
 
 
 

The respondents did not give evidence at the hearing of their application.

The primary judge's reasons  
 
 
The  primary  judge  concluded  that  factors  of  overall  delay  and  the  lost 
evidence made it appropriate to grant the stay5.  In arriving at this conclusion his 
Honour stated the test in this way:6 
 

""[W]hether the combination of loss of primary data or evidence and delay 
constitute,  not  abuse  of  power  or  inappropriate  prosecution  or  abuse  of 
process, but whether on the material before this Court continuation of the 
indictment  to  trial  by  jury  could  constitute  an  unacceptable  injustice  or 
unfairness (Walton v Gardiner).""  (Emphasis added) 

His Honour purported to state the test by reference to the decision of this 
 
Court  in  Walton  v  Gardiner7.    A  majority  of  the  Court  approved  each  of  the 
formulations of the test applied by members of the Court of Appeal; ""whether, in 
all  the  circumstances,  the  continuation  of  the  proceedings  would  involve 
unacceptable  injustice  or  unfairness"",  or  whether  the  ""continuation  of  the 
proceedings would be 'so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive' as to constitute an 
abuse of process"".8  Their Honours observed that it had been made plain by the 
Court of Appeal that the court would only be satisfied that continuation of the 
proceedings constituted an abuse in an exceptional or extreme case9.   
 
 
The respondents acknowledge that the primary judge misstated the test in 
asking  whether  the  loss  of  primary  data  and  the  delay  could  constitute  an 
unacceptable injustice or unfairness.  However, they submit that a fair reading of 
the whole of his Honour's reasons discloses that the error was one of expression 
and not of principle.  This submission must be rejected.  Throughout the reasons

it  is  apparent  that  his  Honour  is  directing  attention  to  the  risk  that  the  lost 
evidence may be productive of unfairness to the respondents10.   
 
 
His Honour's consideration of the evidence of the ""straddle effect"" and its 
significance  to  the  issues  in  the  trial  is  demonstrative  of  an  approach  which 
addressed the possibility that the trial may be unfair to the respondents because 
they had lost the opportunity of establishing by objective evidence an hypothesis 
that was consistent with their innocence.  His Honour said this:11

""Accepting  that  the  aircraft  spent  some  four  minutes  in  taxiing  and  the 
PAL  transmission  sent  during  pre-flight  procedures  some  six  minutes 
previous,  the  differing  accounts  of  the  RFDS  pilots  that  there  was  no 
runway  lighting  with  the  claims  of  activation  by  the  pilots,  could  be 
reconciled.    The  lighting  sequence  ended  during  take-off  and  the 
observation  of  the  RFDS  members  made  during  that  take-off,  following 
their  hearing  the  aircraft's  acceleration.    That  might  be  conjecture  but 
could  be  a  matter  advanced  at  trial.    That  conjecture  is  relevant  to  the 
initial  question  of  whether  or  not  the  runway  lighting  was  on  at  the 
relevant  time.    Less  problematic  is  its  relevance  to  the  issue  of 
recklessness.    The  sequence,  especially  the  'straddle'  possibility,  is 
whether the pilots were reasonably entitled to assume that the lighting was 
in operation.   

The  above  matters  are  made  more  complex  and  significant  if,  at 
 
trial,  the  jury  accepted  the  prosecution  evidence  that  the  aircraft  had 
moved  along  runway  A,  whereas  it  ought  to  have  exited  the  terminal 
apron upon taxiway C before executing a 180 degree turn at the southern 
end  of  the  main  runway.    This  course  would  have  impinged  on  the 
capacity of the pilots for observation of the IWDI.  Thus even if the jury 
were to be satisfied, on the evidence, that the runway lights were 'off' at 
the  time  of  take-off,  the  issues  of  timing,  straddle,  activation  by 
transmission, and the like, remain cogent matters on 'recklessness'.  The 
jury  would  be  well  able  to  consider  whether  the  differing  views  of  the 
pilots  and  the  RFDS  pilots,  the  position  of  the  windsocks,  the  use  of 
runways  A  or  C  for  taxiing,  the  effects  of  other  illumination  from  the

terminal  or  apron  lighting,  and  various  inconsistencies  between  the 
evidence  of  observers,  both  inside  and  outside  of  the  aircraft  in  their 
general consideration of a verdict.  But the PAL related matters require a 
journey 
the 
[respondents] to the risk of an unfair conviction."" 

into  conjecture  and/or  complex  evaluation  exposing 

His Honour went on:12 
 

 
""Retrieval  of  the  electronic  data  from  either  the  FDR  and/or  the 
Monitor List would have resolved the issue of whether the runway lights 
were active at the relevant time.  Each might have provided certainty as to 
whether  there  had  been  activation  or  its  attempt.    Comparison  of  times 
recorded  might  have  shown  equipment  failure  or  the  likelihood  of  a 
'straddle' effect, resulting in truncated operation.  Given the limited time 
the  aircraft  was  on  the  ground  (33 minutes),  the  length  of  the  lighting 
operation  (32 minutes),  and  the  time  spent  in  taxiing  (4 minutes),  the 
impact  of  timing  sequences  and  the  need  for  the  'warning'  lighting,  the 
matters relied on by the [respondents] are neither far-fetched nor artificial 
forensic constructs.  If a 'straddle' was sent while the pilots were preparing 
for take-off whilst the passengers were embarking, the lights might have 
ended  the  10 minute  sequence  later  in  the  taxiing  manoeuvre  or  as  the 
aircraft  accelerated.    The  observations  of  the  RFDS  pilots  could  be 
reconciled with the pilot having activated the system."" 

 
His Honour had earlier noted that it was a mandatory requirement that the 
PAL  be  activated  before  the  aircraft  commenced  taxiing.    This,  it  may  be 
observed, is against acceptance of the proposition that retrieval of the data from 
the FDR would have resolved the issue of whether the runway lights were on at 
the  relevant  time  since  the  FDR  only  records  information  when  the  aircraft's 
engines  are  running.    Activation  of  the  PAL  at  the  airport  before  the  aircraft's 
engines  were  turned  on  while  the  passengers  were  embarking,  as  his  Honour 
posits in the above extract, would not have been captured by the FDR.   
 
 
 

His Honour's conclusion was expressed as follows:13 

 
""The stay of proceedings ought be granted.  Two accused who, on 
the allegation, are jointly liable, had differing tasks in the operation of the

aircraft at the relevant times of taxiing and take-off.  Severance provides 
no purpose.  The nature of crime with its doctrine of strict liability and the 
statutory  provisions  governing  'mistake  of  fact',  make  any  trial  more 
complex.  The time elapsed from the event until trial is some seven years, 
increasing the understandable, but  greater, need for witnesses to rely  on 
their first statements, and the effects of the passage of time on memory, 
might, absent primary evidence, reduce the case to 'word on word'.  The 
complexity  of  the  IWDI  and  'straddle'  matters  is  real  and  resolution 
requires  more  than  assumption  or  conjecture  for  a  fair  and  just 
determination.  The peripheral matters raised by the [respondents] might 
have  some  prejudicial  effect  going  to  discretion,  but  it  is  the  factors  of 
overall delay and loss of significant primary evidence which persuades me 
to grant the applications.""

An essential element that the Crown must prove in support of the principal 
and  alternative  counts  is  that  the  runway  lighting  was  not  on  at  the  time  the 
aircraft  moved  along  the  runway  and  took-off.    The  lost  evidence  goes  to  this 
issue as does the testimony of witnesses whose accuracy and reliability may be 
affected  by  delay. 
  The  appellant  correctly  submits  that  his  Honour's 
consideration of the complexity of the joint trial involving possible ""defences"" of 
mistake  of  fact  under  the  Criminal  Code  (Cth)  was  not  relevant  to  any  issue 
raised by the application.   
 
His Honour had earlier concluded that the delay alone would not warrant a 
 
stay  of  proceedings14.    He  distinguished  between  the  delay  to  the  date  the 
complaints  were  laid  and  the  subsequent  delays  associated  with  the  court 
proceedings.  However, his ultimate conclusion was based upon the loss of the 
primary evidence and ""overall"" delay.  It was not explained how the overall delay 
operated in combination with the lost evidence to create irremediable prejudice to 
the respondents, nor did his Honour address the circumstance that at least some 
of the delay was attributable to the conduct of the defence15.  On the appeal the 
respondents do not rely  on the overall delay but  maintain that  the  unexplained 
delay of two years and three months before the complaints were laid occasioned 
prejudice in that they had lost the opportunity to obtain the early recollection of

in the exercise of the balancing process in determining whether to grant a stay.

witnesses.  It is to be noted that the respondents were on notice of the allegation 
not later than 2 January 2002.   
 
 
The respondents do not contend that the loss of objective evidence, such 
as  electronically  recorded  data  or  the  like,  would  ordinarily  justify  a  stay  of 
proceedings on indictment.  In the course of argument the respondents conceded 
that the loss of film recorded by a closed-circuit television camera at the scene of 
an alleged offence would not afford a basis for a stay16.  They seek to distinguish 
their case on the basis that the loss here is of the independent record of the event 
giving rise to the charge.  This is said to be productive of unfairness of the kind 
that  informs  the  power  to  stay  since  the  trial  will  necessarily  involve  an 
incomplete reconstruction of the event.  
 
 
The distinction between an independent record forming a constituent part 
of an event and an independent record of an event is without substance.  Trials 
involve  the  reconstruction  of  events  and  it  happens  on  occasions  that  relevant 
material is not available; documents, recordings and other things may be lost or 
destroyed.  Witnesses may die.  The fact that the tribunal of fact is called upon to 
determine issues of fact upon less than all of the material which could relevantly 
bear upon the matter does not make the trial unfair17. 
 
 
The  respondents  submit  that  in  the  event  error  is  established  their 
application should be remitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania given what is 
described as ""the complexity of the factual matters"".  This submission should be 
rejected.  The exercise of the primary judge's discretion has been shown to have

It is well established that the circumstances in which proceedings may be 
found to be an abuse of process are not susceptible of exhaustive definition19.  It 
is  not  necessary  to  consider  whether  there  may  be  circumstances  in  which  the 
loss of admissible evidence occasions injustice of a character that would make 
the  continuation  of  proceedings  on  indictment  an  abuse  of  the  process  of  the 
court.  This is not such a case.  The content of the Monitor List and the recording 
made  by  the  FDR  is  unknown.    In  these  circumstances  it  is  not  correct  to 
characterise  their  loss  as  occasioning  prejudice  to  the  respondents.    The  lost 
evidence serves neither to undermine nor to support the Crown case.  It is to be 
observed that if the Crown is unable to exclude the hypothesis, that the runway 
lighting  was  illuminated  as  the  aircraft  moved  along  it  and  that  it  ceased 
operating  coincidentally  at  the  time  of  take-off,  it  would  fail  to  establish  an 
element of the principal and the alternative offence.  
 
 
There is no feature of the delay  that justifies taking the extreme step of 
permanently staying proceedings on the indictment.  It has not been established 
that  any  prejudice  arising  by  reason  of  the  delay  cannot  be  addressed  by 
direction20.  
 
For these reasons the appeal should be allowed, the order of the Supreme 
 
Court of Tasmania entered on 16 May 2008 should be set aside and in its place 
the application for a permanent stay of proceedings on the indictment should be 
dismissed.

11078,2757471,Jaturawong v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 168,"Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : On 14 May 2010, the applicant pleaded guilty to and was sentenced in respect of 7 counts of being an accessory before the fact to the offence of Misconduct in Public Office, committed by Paul Francis McPherson. 

2The principal offender, Mr McPherson, was sentenced at the same time in respect of one offence of corruptly receiving a reward contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 249B (count 1) and for one offence of Misconduct in Public Office (count 2). 

3Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 166, Mr McPherson was also dealt with in respect of two further offences contained in a Form 1 attached to count 1, the s 249B offence. Those offences were a further specific offence pursuant to s 249B(1)(a)(i) for corruptly issuing a licence in exchange for a small amount of cannabis and a further charge of false evidence given to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), contrary to the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, s 80(c). 

4The offences under the Crimes Act , s 249B carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The offence of giving false evidence to ICAC relevantly carried a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment. 

5The offence of Misconduct in Public Office is a common law offence in respect of which the penalty is at large. As the offence to which the applicant was an accessory was a common law offence, the penalty for the accessory offence is also at large. However, when sentencing for a common law offence, the court has regard to any corresponding statutory offence as a reference point for the imposition of any penalty: see R v Hokin, Burton and Peisley (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 280 at 291. 

6In this case, the Crimes Act , Pt 4A provides for offences of corruptly receiving commissions and other corrupt practices in respect of which the maximum sentence is 7 years imprisonment. Mr McPherson's misconduct was in corruptly receiving payments whilst acting as the Manager of the Botany Registry of the RTA. Both the applicant and the Crown accepted that a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment was the relevant reference point in this case and that that was the reference point most likely to have been taken by Berman DCJ. 

7Pursuant to the Crimes Act , Pt 9, s 346, an accessory before the fact is liable to the same punishment as the principal offender. Accordingly, a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment is also the relevant reference point for the offences committed by the applicant and again, it was assumed by the applicant and the Crown that his Honour sentenced the applicant by reference to a maximum penalty of 7 years. 

8His Honour imposed upon the applicant a total aggregate sentence of 2 years 10 months imprisonment to date from 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 March 2013, with a total aggregate non-parole period of 1 year 8 months to date from 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 January 2012. His Honour allowed a 20 per cent discount for the applicant's plea of guilty to each count. 

9Mr McPherson was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 3 years comprising an effective non-parole period of 2 years to date from 14 May 2010 to 13 May 2012 with a balance of 12 months to date from 14 May 2012 to 13 May 2013. His Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. 

10For reasons which I explain below, it is relevant in the case of Mr McPherson to understand the sentences that his Honour imposed for each offence on the indictment. On count 1 on the indictment (that is, the s 249B offence), taking into account the offences on the Form 1, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to date from 14 November 2010 (that is, the date of sentence). 

11On count 2 on the indictment (that is, the Misconduct in Public Office offence) his Honour sentenced Mr McPherson to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 14 November 2010 with an additional term of 12 months (giving a head sentence for this offence of 2 years 6 months). 

12Accordingly, Mr McPherson was sentenced to a total aggregate sentence in respect of which the additional term was 2 months longer than that which was imposed on the applicant, and received a non-parole period which was 4 months longer than that to which the applicant was sentenced. 

13Although Mr McPherson received a longer sentence overall, the applicant received a longer aggregate sentence for the accessorial offence than Mr McPherson received for the principal offence of Misconduct in Public Office. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 months as compared to a non-parole period of 18 months in the case of Mr McPherson. The applicant was sentenced to a balance of term of 14 months compared to a balance of term of 12 months in the case of Mr McPherson. 

Background facts to the offending conduct 

14Mr McPherson was the Registry Services Manager of the Botany Motor Registry. The position of Registry Services Manager was the most senior position at the Registry, with duties involving the proper management of the Registry, which included probity obligations, the overview of procedural regularity in the conduct of licensing matters, adherence to the RTA's policies and procedures, and staff supervision, including the checking of licence applications. 

15Mr McPherson had authority to undertake testing of applicants for driver licences and the issue of licences to those who passed their test, although this was not a routine part of his responsibilities. Mr McPherson in fact engaged in those activities from time to time. He also, from time to time, administered and assessed applicants for driver licences who sat the Driver Knowledge Test, issued driver licences, including licence upgrades; allocated examiners to practical driver testing and allocated test routes to be taken by applicants for the practical part of the licence test. 

16The applicant was a driving instructor and advertised his business in a Thai language newspaper. 

17Some time in about 2004, the applicant made the acquaintance of an alleged co-offender, Victor Phomsavanh (Victor), who ran a Thai restaurant in Mascot. Mr McPherson was a regular patron at the restaurant. The applicant, Mr McPherson and Victor became involved in a scheme whereby for payment made to him by Victor, Mr McPherson improperly assisted applicants to obtain learner permits or driver licences. He did so in a variety of ways, including by assisting applicants answering questions on the Driver Knowledge Test, indicating in advance the route an examiner would take them on when undertaking a driving test, or in some cases, falsely creating computer entries indicating that a practical driving test was not required. 

18The common law Misconduct in Public Office offence to which Mr McPherson pleaded guilty occurred over the period 31 October 2004 to 29 August 2006. Mr McPherson was charged with a common law offence, rather than a series of specific offences under s 249B, because he was paid sums of money over this period on a regular basis by Victor, rather than being paid in respect of each individual applicant whom he assisted. In the agreed facts upon which the sentence hearing proceeded, particulars were given of seven persons who were assisted by Mr McPherson, who were clients of the applicant. In addition, particulars were given of another four persons whom Mr McPherson assisted and there was a statement from him that all up he improperly assisted something in the order of 50 people. There was no independent evidence of the amount Mr McPherson received, however, Mr McPherson said he received $3,000 to $4,000 for his involvement in the scheme, as well as the cannabis, which was the subject of the separate s 249B charge. 

19The applicant was charged with individual accessorial offences because he received a specific amount of money from each assisted person. The evidence indicated that the persons whom the applicant assisted and who were the subject of the particular charges paid amounts of money directly to the applicant in the range of $800 to $1,500. His Honour did not make a finding as to the amount that was retained by the applicant, although there was evidence that the applicant paid a portion of this amount to Victor, who in turn paid Mr McPherson. It was not suggested in the agreed facts that the applicant was involved with the other four persons named as having been assisted by Mr McPherson. Nor was the applicant said to have been involved with any other offending. In other words, the charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were not said to be representative charges. 

20The sentencing judge described the offences committed by both Mr McPherson and the applicant as: 

""... very serious indeed. They involved corruption of a public officer, which strikes at the heart of the administration of good Government ..."" 

21His Honour noted that as a result of the corrupt conduct of both, persons were assisted to obtain licences when they were not otherwise entitled to them and thus constituted a danger to legitimate road users. His Honour reiterated, however, that it was the corrupt nature of the dealings between the applicant and Mr McPherson which was of most concern. 
The personal circumstances of the applicant 

22The applicant was born in Thailand and first visited Australia when he was 27 years of age. He subsequently immigrated to Australia in 1993. He came from a relatively poor family, but his upbringing was otherwise normal. He was relatively well-educated. At the time of the commission of the offences, the applicant had been a driving instructor for about 10 years, having obtained the necessary qualifications for this occupation by undertaking a 6 month TAFE course. In addition to practical training in that course, there was instruction about the importance of avoiding corruption. 

23At the time of the offending, the applicant was married and he and his wife had one young child. The applicant and his wife had separated by the time he came to be sentenced, it would seem because of the applicant's offending conduct. At the time of his sentencing, the applicant was living alone in a boarding house and was undertaking a course of study. He suffers from sleep apnoea and his sleep had been particularly disturbed as a result of the stress of the proceedings. 

24The applicant proffered, by way of explanation for his offending conduct, that he wished to help members of his fellow Thai community. His concern arose because the Driver Knowledge Test, that was a compulsory part of obtaining a licence, was not in the Thai language. His Honour found this explanation unsatisfactory, first, because the applicant received large sums of money for his "" assistance "" to his clients in obtaining their licences and secondly, although the RTA tests are conducted in English, a person undertaking such tests is entitled to have the assistance of an interpreter. His Honour considered therefore, that the essential motivation for the conduct was money. 

25The applicant also sought to excuse his conduct on the basis that bribery was more culturally acceptable in Thailand than in Australia. His Honour was also unimpressed with this excuse. His Honour noted that since the applicant's involvement in the offending conduct had become known, he had become estranged from the Thai community, thus inferring, as I understand his Honour's reasons, that the Thai community did not accept that bribery was acceptable. In any event, his Honour observed that the applicant had learnt in his TAFE course that such conduct was against the law and that he could go to gaol if he engaged in such practices. His Honour further noted that the applicant had told one of his clients to keep quiet about what had happened, because Australians would not accept that type of conduct. His Honour considered that that behaviour exhibited an awareness of the wrongness of his conduct. 

26In his favour, his Honour took into account that the applicant had assisted ICAC with its enquiries into the matter. His Honour considered that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and had expressed appropriate remorse. It was also relevant, in the applicant's favour, that there was a delay in these charges being laid against the applicant following the ICAC hearing. 

27His Honour considered that this was a matter where general deterrence was of significant importance. It was for that reason that his Honour considered a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate. His Honour found special circumstances, in that it was the first time that the applicant would be in custody, but rejected that the applicant had been subjected to extra-curial punishment. 

28His Honour made relevantly similar findings in respect of Mr McPherson, although Mr McPherson's personal circumstances were, obviously, peculiar to him and therefore different from those of the applicant. In particular, his Honour noted that Mr McPherson had lost his job with the RTA, which was a senior position in which he earned $95,000 per year. In addition, he had five children, two from a former marriage and three from his current marriage. The children are young, particularly the three daughters who reside with Mr McPherson and his wife. Mr McPherson's wife has the care of her seriously ill mother. His Honour recognised that there would be a significant impact upon the family's finances, should Mr McPherson go to gaol. However, as his Honour remarked, such consequences are unexceptional: it is the common consequence where a breadwinner in a family commits an offence for which a custodial sentence is appropriate. 

29In addition to finding that Mr McPherson was of a prior good character, his Honour considered that there was much about his personal life about which he was entitled to be proud. Mr McPherson was involved in playing football and in training junior teams, as well as being involved in surf lifesaving. There was substantial evidence of his otherwise good character before the trial judge. His Honour again considered that in the case of Mr McPherson, money was the motivating cause for the offending conduct. 

Issue on the appeal 

30The sole issue on the appeal is whether the sentence imposed upon the applicant's co-offender gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed on him was disproportionate to that imposed on Mr McPherson, having regard to the objective criminality involved in Mr McPherson's offending which gave rise to the Misconduct in Public Office offence and his own offending as an accessory in respect of seven instances of Mr McPherson's misconduct. The Crown understood the issues raised involved a question of parity of sentence. It also appears that his Honour was concerned with that question, as he raised it in the course of the sentencing hearing. In this regard, the Crown submitted that the sentencing process that his Honour was engaged with presented some difficulties, having regard to the fact that Mr McPherson was to be sentenced for an additional offence in respect of which the matters on the Form 1 were to be taken into account. 

31The principles governing parity of sentencing between co-offenders are well established. There will be error in the sentencing process if there is such a discrepancy in the sentences imposed so as to engender in a co-offender a justifiable sense of grievance and an appearance of injustice: see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 per Mason J at 613; per Dawson J at 623. In determining that question, it is both relevant and necessary to have regard to the gravity of the conduct of each offender, their respective circumstances, including their antecedents and any relevant mitigating circumstances: see Lowe per Brennan J at 617. The significance of this principle in sentencing has been identified as being of "" abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community "": see Regina v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]. 

32The test for determining whether a person would have a justifiable sense of grievance is an objective one: see R v Doggett (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported); Regina v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at [6]; Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 308 at [37]. However, even where there is a disparity in the sentences imposed which satisfies this test, an appellate court will not intervene where to do so would result in a sentence being imposed upon the applicant which is itself so disproportionate to a proper sentencing outcome, having regard to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the applicant's offending conduct. In this regard, the court must obey the statutory mandate in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3), namely, that appellate intervention is confined to those cases where the court is of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law: see the Criminal Appeal Act , s 69(3); R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432 at [16]; R v Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114. 

33This statutory injunction underpins the notion of proportionality which requires that a person is to be sentenced with a minimal level of punishment, so that the sentence imposed should bear reasonable proportionality to the objective seriousness of the crime for which the sentence is imposed. As Brennan J said in Lowe : 

""... it is wrong to think that that it is 'more important that sentences should be proportionate to one another than that they should be proportionate to guilt'. R v Robson and East (1970) Crim LR 354, at p 355 ..."" 

See also in this Court: R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. 

34There are two circumstances where the question whether there has been such disparity in the sentences imposed on co-offenders raises particular difficulties. One is where the offenders are sentenced by different judges: see Lowe at 617 and 622. That was not the case here. The applicant and Mr McPherson were sentenced by the same judge at the same time. There are judicial comments to the effect that where co-offenders are sentenced by the same judge at the same time and detailed reasons given for the sentences imposed, an appellate court will be cautious in intervening on the ground of disparity. Presumably, the reason for these remarks is that in such cases, it is unlikely that the sentencing judge will not be alive to the principles of parity involved in sentencing co-offenders. 

35The other area of difficulty is where the co-offenders are charged with different offences. That is the case here, as it had to be. The offences which each committed were different. That raises the question whether it is the principle of parity which is relevant in this case. 

36The question is not easily resolved and for reasons which I explain in the immediately following paragraph, it is not necessary to finally determine the matter. For my part, I am inclined to consider that the parity principle is relevant, notwithstanding that the applicant and Mr McPherson were guilty of different offences and Mr McPherson's offending was greater in terms of the time over which the offending conduct occurred and the number of instances persons were corruptly assisted to obtain driver licences. Nonetheless, there was a direct correspondence between the accessorial conduct of the applicant and the Misconduct in Public Office conduct of Mr McPherson in respect of the 7 persons who were assisted both by the applicant and Mr McPherson. The Crown also approached the matter on the basis that the parity principle applied. 

37As it turns out, it is not necessary to determine whether the principle of parity in its strict sense does apply because, during the hearing of the appeal, the Crown accepted that the gravity of Mr McPherson's offending conduct was greater than that of the applicant. The Crown also conceded that this was a case where, viewed objectively, the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentence imposed on him as compared to the sentence imposed upon Mr McPherson. The Crown's concession in this regard involved its acceptance that Mr McPherson's offending conduct involved not only the seven matters to which the applicant was an accessory, but four other distinct instances of offending, together with other offending conduct, which in total, had involved Mr McPherson corruptly assisting about 50 persons. In this regard, not only was Mr McPherson's offending more extensive, but it occurred over a longer period of time. In making the concession, the Crown also accepted that his Honour had sentenced Mr McPherson for the totality of his conduct to which I have referred. 

38In my opinion, the concession was rightly made. His Honour said: 

""Although Mr McPherson received he says, and there is nothing to contradict it, a relatively small amount of money, three thousand to four thousand dollars plus the cannabis of course, he freely admits that he assisted a large number of people, around fifty in a corrupt way. That really is the gravamen of his misconduct. The money may have been relatively small but there were a very large number of separate criminal corrupt acts committed by the offender."" 

39Mr McPherson was sentenced to 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months for the Misconduct in Public Office offence, involving something in the order of 50 separate occasions of receiving bribes. The applicant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 2 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 20 months for the seven occasions on which he was an accessory to Mr McPherson's Misconduct in Public Office offence. That bald comparison needs to be modified by two considerations. The first is by having regard to the sentence that would have been imposed but for the discount. In Mr McPherson's case, considering the total effective sentence imposed for both counts on the indictment the starting point was 4 years, that is, reduced to 3 years by the 25 per cent discount. In the applicant's case, the starting point was 3 years 6.5 months, reduced to a total effective sentence of 2 years 10 months by the 20 per cent discount. 

40Further, notwithstanding the greater criminality involved in the misconduct offence, Mr McPherson's criminality for which he was sentenced on Count 1, together with his criminality in respect of the offences contained on the Form 1 is not to be overlooked: see In Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 , especially at [42] where Spigelman CJ observed that in dealing with offences listed on a Form 1, the court is to take into account the matters on the Form 1 "" with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence "". 

41In this case, the applicant was not charged with any other offences other than the seven that were charged on indictment, nor did he admit guilt in respect of any other matters. In particular, he did not provide false information to ICAC, as did Mr McPherson. Nonetheless, he has been given a total effective sentence which is only 2 months less than that of Mr McPherson and a non-parole period which is 4 months less, and, as I have said, he received a more severe total sentence on the accessory offences as compared to the sentence imposed upon Mr McPherson as the principal offender. 

42The Crown initially submitted that Mr McPherson's objective circumstances were far more favourable than the applicant's. That submission may not have been maintained, given the Crown's concession to which I have referred. In any event, I do not consider the submission to have been made good. His Honour did not say so and for myself, I do not see any substantial difference. Both were family men; both have lost their jobs; both had a connection with their respective communities; both have attempted to rehabilitate themselves. The imposition of a gaol term would involve hardship to the families of both, because of the loss of income that both the applicant and Mr McPherson had previously contributed to their respective families. The significant difference in this regard between the two, which, at a subjective level, may well be more serious for the applicant, was that his marriage had come to an end. However, Mr McPherson's family life has remained intact, notwithstanding that his family was undoubtedly experiencing real hardship, engendered by the loss of his substantial earnings as Manager of an RTA Registry and the loss of his support within the home, given the difficult circumstances in which his wife finds herself, looking after the children of the marriage as well as her invalid mother. 

43In my opinion, and as conceded by the Crown, his Honour erred in imposing a disproportionately severe sentence on the applicant as compared to Mr McPherson. That does not of itself mean that the Court should intervene. The Court must be satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law: the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(3). In my opinion it is. There is nothing in the objective circumstances of the case or in the subjective circumstances of the applicant that warrant him serving a sentence which was more severe than that imposed on Mr McPherson. His accessorial conduct was significantly less, both in the period of time over which and the number of occasions on which the conduct occurred, than the offending conduct of Mr McPherson. 

44Although the sentences imposed upon Mr McPherson were lenient, they were not outside an available discretionary range, particularly having regard to his prior good character. Notwithstanding the lenient sentence imposed on Mr McPherson, appellate intervention in the sentence imposed upon the applicant is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by Berman DCJ should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. 

45In determining the sentence which should be imposed on the applicant, I have applied the same discount for the plea as did the sentencing judge. I have also had regard to the affidavit evidence he has filed which establishes that he has been of good conduct whilst in prison and is taking steps to rehabilitate himself by undertaking courses of study. 

46In my opinion, this is a case where it is appropriate to set an aggregate sentence of imprisonment pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 53A(1). Although the offences were separate and occurred at different times, the offending involved conduct of the same type on each occasion and was part of a course of conduct by the applicant. 

47Accordingly, I propose that the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 September 2011 together with an additional term of 11 months to expire on 13 August 2012. 

48Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 53A(2), the individual sentences that I would have imposed in respect of the individual offences are as follows: 

Count 1: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 May 2010 to 13 March 2011; 

Count 2: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 June 2010 to 13 April 2011; 

Count 3: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 September 2010 to 13 July 2011; 

Count 4: a fixed term of 9 months to date from 14 November 2010 to 13 August 2011; 

Count 5: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012; 

Count 6: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012; 

Count 7: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012. 

49I propose the following orders: 

1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence; 

2. Appeal allowed; 

3. Sentences imposed by Berman DCJ on 14 May 2011 quashed; 

4. Pursuant to the Crime (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999, s 53A(1) the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 14 May 2010 to expire on 13 September 2011 together with an additional term of 11 months to expire on 13 August 2012.

This is an appeal by the Attorney-General, Singapore against the decision of Kulasekaram J who held that the plaintiff/ respondent had proved negligence on the part of the prison authorities at the Medium Security Prison, Changi on 15 September 1965 and awarded him damages for the injuries sustained by him as a consequence of such negligence. The appeal is directed both against the question of liability as well as the quantum of damages awarded in the sum of $14,000 for general damages and $600 for special damages.
The plaintiff was a prisoner nearing the end of his term of imprisonment at the material time and had been instructed by the instructor of metal works at that prison to place some asbestos sheets on the metallic rafters of the framework of a garage which said sheets were intended to serve as the roof of that garage.
In order to appreciate what follows, without constant reference to a model which was produced, we propose to give a brief description of this garage. This metallic framework of the garage, which had been erected previously so as to adjoin the main Prison Industries Office was immediately to the right of that office as one looks at it from the front. The proposed roof had a slight downward slope from the front to the rear and the side nearest to the office ran parallel to the side of that office and, for convenience, we shall call it the third side of the garage. Needless to say, there were no walls on any of the four sides of the proposed garage and the proposed roof was supported by metallic poles. The last side, which we shall call the fourth side, was that side which ran parallel to the third side at the extreme right hand end of the structure as one looks at it from the front.
It is unfortunate perhaps that, although a model was produced without any clear explanation of the exact scale adopted in preparing it, there is little evidence as to precise heights, lengths or widths, and we are accordingly unable in this judgment to give precise measurements. It is common ground, however, that the metallic framework of the roof ranged from about eight to nine feet in height.
It is also perhaps unfortunate that in the presentation of the case by both parties no attempt was made to produce, as exhibits, a sample of the asbestos sheets the plaintiff was instructed to place on the framework of the roof and either of the two planks said to have been placed on the metallic framework of the roof to assist the plaintiff in his work on the roof. Neither party adduced evidence of the exact measurements of the asbestos sheets said to have been used or of the planks. All we know from the evidence is that the sheets were heavy and were seven feet long. It would appear that some pieces of paper were produced before the trial judge to represent the asbestos sheets to enable him to follow the evidence but we do not have the benefit of these pieces of paper nor do we know exactly where they were placed on the model by the witnesses during the trial and we have to rely heavily on what the trial judge has himself said in his grounds of decision as to where and how exactly they were placed. There is, however, just sufficient material, despite these inadequacies in the presentation of the case, for us to reach our own conclusions as to where responsibility should lie for the fall that morning of the plaintiff from the roof on to the ground outside as a result of which his injuries were sustained.
What we have to decide in this appeal is whether the trial judge was right in finding that the prison authorities were negligent in failing to provide a sufficiently reasonable and safe system of work for the work which they required the plaintiff to do on the metallic framework of the roof and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and finally whether the quantum of damages awarded was excessive.
We now turn to the facts bearing in mind that, on the question of liability, there were two conflicting versions of the accident.
The plaintiff`s version was to the effect that he was ordered by one Leong Fook Seng, the instructor of metal works at the prison, to climb up a ladder to the top of the framework and squat on one of two planks which had been placed on the framework by him and a fellow prisoner on their own volition the previous day. This plank, according to him, was near the fourth side and parallel to it. He squatted on this plank at about the middle of that side and was facing the fourth side with his back to the office. A sheet of asbestos was then handed up by Leong and another prisoner from the ground below which he and PW 3, another fellow prisoner who was also squatting on the plank beside him, placed on the top of the framework in front of them near the edge of the fourth side. The length of the sheet was parallel to the plank on which they were squatting. They were then requested by Leong to push the sheet forward which they did. PW 3 then moved away to bring the other plank. Leong then directed the plaintiff to push the sheet further forward which he proceeded to do. Whilst he was pushing the sheet further forward, the sheet broke into two halves and that half which was projecting beyond the fourth side over the grass below fell down leaving the other half still on the framework. When this happened he lost his balance and fell over outside the fourth side on to the broken half of the asbestos sheet which was already on the ground outside. He further said that this sheet was the first sheet placed on the roof and that this was his first experience of working on a framework such as this one and that he had never volunteered to do this job but had been ordered to do so by Leong who had never previously ascertained whether he had any experience of this type of work.
As against this version we have the version of the principal witness for the defence, that is, the instructor, Leong. That morning he had instructed the plaintiff to climb to the top of the framework and place two asbestos sheets, one on each of the two rear corners of the roof. The first sheet was placed on the corner between the third side and the rear. The longer edge of the sheet was along the third side while one of the shorter edges of the sheet was along the rear side edge of the roof. The second sheet was similarly placed on the other corner between the rear and the fourth side. Just before the accident occurred, the plaintiff was squatting on a plank which was placed lengthwise alongside the last rafter which ran parallel to the rear of the roof. According to Leong the plaintiff was squatting on this plank and was adjusting the second sheet into position so as to cause it to be in proper alignment with the first sheet. After this had been done Leong instructed the plaintiff to come down via the ladder which was then leaning against the framework on the rear side while Leong himself was standing on the ground below near it. The plaintiff then stood up on the plank and looked away from the building and while he was doing this, he happened to step with his right foot on to the asbestos sheet which broke and caused the plaintiff to fall down on the grass to the rear of the garage. But he did not know the manner in which the plaintiff fell.
It will be seen from these two versions that, whereas the plaintiff said that he fell off over the fourth side as a result of pushing the sheet which broke and caused him to lose his balance whilst he was still squatting on a plank running parallel to the fourth side, the defence version was that the plaintiff was squatting on a plank running parallel to the rear which had been placed alongside that rafter nearest the rear and that when he was ordered to come down, he stood up on that plank and looked away from the building and that he happened to place his right foot on the asbestos sheet which broke and caused him to fall down on to the grass at the rear.
The trial judge quite rightly rejected the plaintiff`s version as to where he fell and what he had been previously doing just before he fell, as it was indeed a most incredible story, and preferred the defence version of the accident up to a point, namely, that the plaintiff fell off towards the rear and near its corner with the fourth side and that he had previously been sitting or squatting on a plank parallel to the rear. The trial judge did not, however, accept Leong`s evidence thereafter when he said that he saw the plaintiff stand up on the plank and look away from the building and that while he was looking away, he happened to step with his right foot on the sheet which broke and caused him to fall down. This is what the trial judge said: 
 
Then Leong goes on to say that the plaintiff then stood up on the plank and looked away from the building and while he was looking away he happened to step with his right foot on the asbestos sheet which broke and he fell down. He went on to say that he did not know the manner the plaintiff fell down. One wonders why Leong who was an eye witness is unable to say the manner the plaintiff fell down. Could it be that Leong is not quite clear about the details of the last few critical moments before the plaintiff`s fall? On Leong`s evidence it would appear very probable that plaintiff as he was raising himself up, or as he raised himself up on the plank, with a view to coming down, lost his balance. This apparent stepping on the asbestos sheet was very probably an involuntary act on the part of the plaintiff when he tried to regain his balance having first of all lost it. To my mind this stepping on the asbestos sheet by the plaintiff was not a deliberate or careless act on the part of the plaintiff. There is no reason why plaintiff would want to step on this asbestos sheet.
 
 
 
I find that the plaintiff while raising himself up from the squatting position on the plank lost his balance and thereby stepped on the edge of the asbestos sheet and came to grief. The main cause of the accident was plaintiff`s losing his balance.
 
 
 
It should be noted that Leong`s evidence is to the effect merely that as the plaintiff stood up and looked away from the building, he happened to step on the asbestos sheet which broke. It does not seem to us that Leong was attempting to give the impression that the plaintiff deliberately stepped on that sheet. His evidence on this point is equally consistent with the plaintiff`s losing his balance. It is difficult to understand the trial judge`s conclusion that Leong`s evidence on this point amounted to an allegation of a deliberate act or of sheer careless conduct on the plaintiff`s part. It should be remembered that in Leong`s version which was accepted up to that stage, the plaintiff, after having climbed up the ladder, had managed to get on to the roof somehow and to place the first sheet against the third side towards the rear and then move himself into position to the other rear corner with the fourth side. During all these manoeuvres there was no suggestion by anyone that he ever stood up on the plank or conducted himself otherwise than in a careful manner. Presumably, he was comporting himself with sufficient care for his own safety by easing himself along in a squatting or sitting position on that plank from the third side to the fourth side. One would have thought that when he was asked to come down, he could have done so without mishap in the same manner as he tackled the work he had previously done on the roof. What caused him to lose his balance was his standing up or raising himself up to such an extent as to cause him to lose his balance.
We agree, however, with the trial judge that working on a framework of a roof such as this one is different from working on tops of buses which the plaintiff had done before. As the trial judge has said `it entails more risks and requires more experience at balancing oneself`. He rejected Leong`s evidence that he had ascertained from the plaintiff about his experience and that the plaintiff told him that he could work on the top without any support. He also rejected Leong`s statement that he had warned the plaintiff before he went on to the roof not to step on the asbestos sheet. He accordingly found that the system of work was reasonable and safe provided a worker employed on the roof had had the necessary experience. In short, he found that the system of work employed in the present case of using a ladder to go up to a roof and then to use planks already pieced on the framework to serve as a sort of a platform to work from to be unsafe in all the circumstances in the case of an inexperienced workman such as the plaintiff.
On the facts found by the trial judge, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the prison authorities, in sending up an inexperienced person such as the plaintiff on to the metallic framework of the roof, failed to take adequate precautions against the kind of over-balancing that did occur. Such precautions were those which a reasonable and prudent man would have thought so obvious that it was folly to omit them or that it was unreasonable or imprudent to omit them - see the test laid down by Lord Normand in 
 Paris v Stepney Borough Council 
 [1951] 1 All ER 49 or this test as explained in the later case of 
 Morris v West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
[1956] 1 All ER 385 which this court approved in 
 Eng Lye Hup Co Ltd v Chua Sai Choo & Anor 
 
 
 [1965-1968] SLR 369 
.
In our opinion it was insufficient merely to provide a ladder and a plank or two for a workman inexperienced in these matters and to require him to lift up a heavy asbestos sheet whilst sitting or squatting on a plank over the gaping void of the metallic framework of a roof and then to require him to place or align that sheet over the rafters in the desired position especially when the instructor himself had had no experience whatever of working on top of rafters and framework such as this.
The next question we have to decide is whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. As we have already said earlier the plaintiff had already executed certain works on the roof prior to his fall, such as placing two asbestos sheets along the third and fourth sides respectively towards the rear corner of the roof. He seems to have exercised sufficient care for his own safety in moving along the plank from one side to the other without mishap. What caused him to lose his balance was his act of raising himself up on the plank in order to reach the ladder. The trial judge found no contributory negligence on his part because: 
 
It cannot be said that this accident was in any way caused by the plaintiff not taking reasonable care over his own safety. His losing his balance on the day in question cannot in any was be attributed to his not taking reasonable care over himself. I take the view that it was solely due to his inexperience at working at heights from frameworks such as this one.
 
 
 
With respect we do not entirely agree. We appreciate the risks to which the plaintiff was exposed but he appears, despite his inexperience, to have successfully carried out his earlier duties. Our decision might have been otherwise if he had fallen off the metallic framework of the roof at a much earlier stage, for example if, soon after climbing up the ladder to the top and then in negotiating the rafters with a view to getting on to the plank, he had fallen down. We accept the trial judge`s finding that he did not deliberately step on the asbestos sheet with his right foot. This is exactly what Leong himself said about the plaintiff`s standing up and happening to step on the asbestos sheet save that the trial judge does not quite accept the position that the plaintiff was actually standing up before he fell. He held that the accident occurred as he was raising himself up or as he raised himself up on the plank with a view to coming down. This plank ran parallel to the rear edge of the roof and had been placed lengthwise alongside the rafter nearest the rear. The ladder was leaning up against the rear edge of the roof with the sheet to his right as he faced the rear of the building. One would have thought that if he had exercised the same care as he did on climbing on to the roof and on to the plank, he should have been able to negotiate the return journey safely. We think, however, once the job was done, in raising himself up from his squatting position, he failed to take reasonable care for his own safety and thereby contributed to his own injury. We would accordingly assess his share in the responsibility for the accident at one-half and the damages recoverable will therefore be reduced accordingly.
We now turn to the question of the quantum of damages awarded. The plaintiff suffered injuries to his face and hands. Examination revealed abrasions involving the forehead, nose and both upper limbs and he suffered pain on the passive movements of the shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers. Five days after the accident his fingers had become stiff, painful and swollen and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were noticed affecting both hands. On examination a year later, this diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was confirmed by Dr Horne. In 1967 it seemed probable that this disease had extended to his left leg. He was a blacksmith and the evidence is that it was not likely that he would ever be able to go back to that occupation. The trial judge accepted the evidence of Dr Horne that there was a relationship between the accident and the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, despite the contrary view expressed on behalf of the defence by Dr Gwee which suggested that the onset of this disease was probably rather the emotional upset of the plaintiff arising from his being a prisoner. As against this, the plaintiff had been a prisoner since 1961 and the disease only set in about September 1965 soon after the accident. In our opinion there was ample material to justify the trial judge`s finding on this issue. The trial judge, however, found no positive evidence that the disease had spread to the lower limbs and accordingly proceeded to assess damages on that basis. Although the plaintiff said he had worked as a blacksmith, he had prior to his imprisonment been working as a bar waiter. He was about 39 years of age when damages were assessed. It was then clear that he would be unable to do heavy manual work but the trial judge found that he could, bearing in mind that he was an ex-prisoner, probably be able to obtain some form of employment of a lighter nature for a period of ten working years and not more. We cannot disagree with this assessment of his working potential or with the finding that his earning capacity would have been reduced by about $100 per month from his previous earnings of $200 per month as a waiter. We would therefore confirm the award of $14,000 as general damages being as to $9,000 in respect of loss of earnings and $5,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life. We would also confirm the award of $600 as special damages for loss of earnings before the trial.
The appeal partly succeeds, as indicated earlier, and we would award the appellant three-quarters of his taxed costs of this appeal.

                   The accused was
charged with first degree murder of an acquaintance.  He broke into the
victim's home early one morning and went to the basement, where he took and
loaded a 30.30 rifle, which he used to kill the victim's dog.  The accused, who
was a frequent visitor to the house, was aware that no one would be there until
the victim returned sometime around noon. He started ransacking the house,
found a .32 calibre pistol, loaded it with ammunition and placed it in his
belt. Later, he gathered together everything he had stolen and placed it by the
back door. When the victim returned home for lunch, the accused was still in
the house. The victim saw his slain dog and turned back towards the bathroom,
where the accused was hiding.  The accused came out of the tub and fired the
gun.  Eight bullets entered the victim's body.  Only one was in the area of the
legs; the rest were in the torso and neck.  After the shooting, the accused
took the victim's money and his car keys, placed the stolen goods in the
victim's car and drove away.  The accused was arrested three days later.  In
his statement to the police, he stated that he had gone to the victim's house
to break in and admitted that he had stolen money from the victim and from the
residence.  At trial, however, he testified that he had gone there only to ask
a favour from the victim.  He had then entered the house because of the heavy
rain and, once inside, had decided to steal.  He also testified that he had
aimed the gun at the victim's legs and that he had not intended to kill him but
was only trying to escape.  In cross‑examination, the accused testified
that the money which was found in his possession when he was arrested came in
part from his welfare allowance.  The Crown was allowed to adduce rebuttal
evidence on this issue and two welfare workers testified that the accused had
never received social assistance, and that his applications for welfare had
been refused.  In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill the
victim and that the killing was planned and deliberate, they should find him
guilty of first degree murder.  The trial judge explained that the expression
""planned and deliberate"" meant a ""carefully thought out design
which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful act.  It is the commission of an
unlawful act after having thought about it.  In other words, . . . it
is a planned and desired act"".  The trial judge also instructed the jury
on second degree murder but not on manslaughter.  The accused was convicted of
first degree murder and the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction.  This appeal raised three issues:  (1) whether the trial judge
erred in permitting the Crown to adduce rebuttal evidence; (2) whether the
trial judge adequately charged the jury on the ""planned and
deliberate"" nature of first degree murder; and (3) whether the trial
judge should have instructed the jury that manslaughter was an alternative
verdict.

 

                   Held (Sopinka J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The crucial question with regard to the admission
of rebuttal evidence is not whether the evidence which the Crown seeks to
adduce is determinative of an essential issue, but rather whether it is related
to an essential issue which may be determinative of the case.  If the rebuttal
evidence goes to an essential element of the case and the Crown could not have
foreseen that such evidence would be necessary, then it is generally
admissible.  Thus, if a statement is made during the course of a witness's
testimony at trial which conflicts with other evidence relating to an essential
issue in the case, rebuttal evidence will be permitted to resolve the
conflict.  Here, the rebuttal evidence was admissible.  The evidence of the
welfare workers goes to an integral element of the case and the Crown could not
have foreseen that the accused would testify as he did in light of his earlier
statement.  The bald admission of the robbery in the course of evidence, which
falsely coloured its nature and changed important details, cannot result in a
finding that the rebuttal evidence thereby goes solely to collateral issues. 
Evidence as to the details of the robbery formed an integral part of the
Crown's case and it was important that any confusion with regard to the
accused's statement and testimony on this essential issue be clarified.  This
could only be done by way of reply.  It cannot then be said that the rebuttal
evidence constituted a splitting of the Crown's case.

 

                   When the charge is
read as a whole, it is apparent that the jury was properly instructed on the
issue of planning and deliberation.  The trial judge's directions were quite
clear that these concepts were two distinct elements of the crime of first degree
murder, both of which had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   The trial judge did
not err in not putting manslaughter to the jury.  The killing in this case has
every indication of being a cold-blooded, planned and deliberate execution.  There
was no air of reality to the accused's defence of manslaughter.  It follows
that it would not have been appropriate to have left manslaughter to the jury.

 

                   Per Sopinka J. (dissenting):  The
trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce the rebuttal evidence.  The
rebuttal evidence was not relevant to the accused's assertion that he did not
intend to kill the victim, and it was wholly unnecessary to prove the robbery,
as this had been admitted by the accused's own testimony.  While the Crown had
the right to cross‑examine the accused on collateral facts, in order to
attack his credibility, having done so the Crown had to take the accused's
answers.  Put in context, the rebuttal evidence attacked the accused's
credibility on the sole question of whether he was a recipient of social
assistance, a collateral issue which was raised for the first time in cross‑examination. 
The Crown also argued that the accused made his credibility a central issue by
giving testimony which differed from his police statement.

 

                   In any case where
the accused testifies, his credibility will be on the line.  Allowing rebuttal
evidence simply because the accused has chosen to make his credibility an issue
is far too broad an interpretation of Krause.

 

                   An error of this
nature cannot be cured by application of the proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

                   Cory
J. -- Two main issues are
raised on this appeal.  The first is whether the trial judge erred in
permitting the Crown to call evidence in reply.  The second, turns on the
adequacy of the instructions given to the jury on the critical aspects of first
degree murder, namely planning and deliberation.

 

I.  Factual Background

 

                   On January 20,
1986, the appellant Aalders, shot and killed Lawrence Ford in his home in
St. Basile.  Earlier that morning, Aalders had arranged with a friend to
get a lift to the Ford home.  His friend left him off some distance from the
house.  Aalders was a frequent visitor and was well aware of the family
routine.  He knew when he arrived at 8:00 a.m. of a weekday morning that nobody
would be home.  He was aware that no one would be there until Mr. Ford returned
to the house sometime around noon.  The appellant tried the front door but
received no response.  He then went around to the back door and by means of a
screwdriver that he had fortuitously brought with him, broke into the house. 
As soon as he gained entrance, he immediately went to the basement where he
took and loaded a 30.30 rifle.  He then returned to the main floor.  When he
had descended to the basement the family dog, Tuppy, loyally attempting to
defend the family home, started barking and continued to do so.  Upon his
return to the main floor, Aalders entered the bedroom where the dog was
barking.  There, he shot and killed him.

 

                   With the dog
silenced, the appellant started ransacking the house.  He went first to the
master bedroom and searched the drawers of the night tables and dressers by
emptying their contents onto the floor.  He found a .32 calibre pistol which
was not loaded.  He then located the clip for the pistol with two bullets in
it.  He continued to look for more ammunition for the pistol and finally shot
the lock off a chest in the basement where he found the ammunition.  In his
statement to the police, Aalders said that he loaded the .32 pistol
because it was not as heavy and cumbersome as the 30.30 rifle.  He placed the loaded
pistol in his belt before running back upstairs.  He did this he said, in case
anyone should come into the house as he did not want to get caught.

 

                   While looking for
ammunition in the closets of the house Aalders had discovered jars full of
money.  Thus, after finding and loading the pistol, he returned to the bedroom
and took the jars down from the closets in the master bedroom.  He then went to
the bedroom of Laura Jane Ford, the daughter of the victim, where he
found some more money which he also took.  He then went back downstairs and
located several bags into which he put the money and the other weapons (the
shotguns and the rifle) which he had found in the house.  For nourishment he
took three bottles of wine which he placed in portable bars and two bags of
cookies.

 

                   Some of the money
which was taken from the Ford residence consisted of old Canadian and American
bills which the victim and his daughter had collected.  The total weight of all
the items seized from the house was 190 lbs.  Aalders placed all this material
on the floor beside the door by which he had gained entry.  He stated that he
intended to conceal the material in the woods near the home so that he could
return and collect it later.  Another inference which could be drawn was that
the robbery had been carefully planned to take place while the house was empty,
that Aalders required a car to carry the stolen property and that he was armed
and awaiting the return of Mr. Ford in his car around noon.

 

                   In any event, the
appellant testified that he went back upstairs and when he was in the bathroom
he heard the sound of a door closing downstairs.  With that he became aware
that someone else was in the house.  He stepped into the bathtub and drew the
pistol from his belt.  Aalders saw a shadow pass across the bathroom doorway
and then the reflection of a man's back appeared in the bathroom mirror.  The
man was standing in the master bedroom where the appellant had shot the family
pet.  When he saw the person in the bedroom turn around the appellant advanced
from the bathroom towards the bedroom with the gun in his hand.  He said also
in his evidence at trial that he pointed the gun at the legs of the person in
the room, closed his eyes and pressed the trigger.  He stated that he only
wanted to escape from the house and that he had not meant to kill the victim. 
However, it is of some significance that in his lengthy statement to the
police, Aalders did not mention that he aimed the gun at the victim's legs or
that he had only been trying to escape.  The autopsy revealed that of the eight
bullets that were fired into Ford's body, only one was located in the leg area
while the majority were in the torso and neck area.

 

                   After he shot the
victim, Aalders left the room and went out to Lawrence Ford's car.  When
he saw that the keys were not in the car, he went back into the home and looked
through Ford's pockets until he found them.  He took the keys and $50 to $60
which he found in the victim's wallet.  The appellant then took all the stolen
goods, including the rifle, shotguns and wine placed them in the trunk of the
car and drove away.  He was arrested three days later in Charlesbourg.

 

II.  The Courts Below

 

1.  The Trial Judge's Charge to the
Jury

 

                   The trial judge
explained to the jury that, according to the general rule, murder requires an
intention to kill according to the definitions set out in s. 212(a)(i)
and (ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , s. 229  (a)(i) and (ii)).  He advised the jury that they
must first consider whether the appellant had the intention to kill according
to that general rule.  If so, they must then consider whether this intention
involved planning and deliberation.  The trial judge stated that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the
victim and that the killing was planned and deliberate, then they should find
him guilty of first degree murder.  However, if they found that he
intended to kill the victim, but they had a reasonable doubt that the killing
was planned and deliberate, then they should find him guilty of second
degree murder.

 

                   The trial judge
provided the jury members with a written statement of the elements of the crime
of first degree murder.  The statement read as follows:

 

[translation]  In this case
the prosecution had the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, the
following constituent elements:

 

1. 
That the accused, Gifford Aalders, on or about January 20, 1986, at
Portneuf Station, District of Québec;

 

2. 
unlawfully caused the death of Lawrence Ford;

 

3. 
with the intent to cause his death or to cause him bodily harm that he knew was
likely to cause his death and was reckless whether his death ensued or not;

 

4. 
and he did this with planning and deliberation.

 

                   The trial judge
pointed out to the jury that if they struck out paragraph 4 in the above
statement they would have a list of the elements of second degree murder.

 

                   In explaining the
meaning of the term [TRANSLATION]
""planned and deliberate"", the trial judge stated:

 

[TRANSLATION]  In criminal law, this
expression means the carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying
out of an unlawful act.  It is the commission of an unlawful act after having
thought about it.

 

                   In
other words, one can summarize it by saying:  it is a planned and desired act. 
The person therefore commits a crime with planning and deliberation when he
planned it, when he foresaw this eventuality and when he prepared for it
accordingly, with full knowledge of it.  In other words, it was prepared.

 

                   The trial judge
then moved to a consideration of the exception under s. 213(d) (now s.
230 (d)) of the Code.  He told the jury that if they had a
reasonable doubt about the accused's intention to kill according to the general
rule, they should then consider the exception of s. 213(d).  If
they found the accused intended to commit robbery and caused the death of the
victim in the commission of the robbery, they should find him guilty of second
degree murder.  The trial judge also gave the jury a list of the elements
of constructive murder under s. 213(d) of the Code.  He
instructed the jury that if they had a doubt that the accused intended to kill
the victim, that it was planned and deliberate or that the elements of
s. 213(d) were present, they should acquit the accused.

 

                   In response to a
question from the jury on premeditation, the trial judge stated:

 

[translation]  I will
therefore begin by again explaining the meaning of the expression ""planned
and deliberate"" which can be summarized by the word ""planned"" or
the word ""planning"".

 

Often
instead of always using the full expression ""planned and deliberate"",
it is summarized by saying ""planned, prepared in advance, having thought
about it in advance, having thought about something in advance"", and
that's about it for planning.

 

He also stated:

 

[translation]  In criminal
law, then, the expression ""planned and deliberate"" means the
carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful
act.  So it is the commission of an unlawful act after having thought about
it.  It is an act which is planned and desired.

 

                   In the result, the
jury found the appellant guilty of first degree murder.

 

2.  Court of Appeal 

 

                   The appellant
raised four grounds of appeal:  the admissibility of his statement to police,
the trial judge's charge on first degree murder, the trial judge's failure to
instruct on manslaughter and the admissibility of the Crown's rebuttal
evidence.  The Court of Appeal was unanimous as to the admissibility of the
statement, but Proulx J.A. dissented on the other three grounds:  [1991] R.J.Q.
2097, 69 C.C.C. (3d) 154.  (The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court
on the admissibility of the statement but the application was dismissed on
February 6, 1992, [1992] 1 S.C.R. v.)

 

                   (a)  Proulx J.A.
(dissenting)

 

                   Proulx J.A. would
have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

                   (i) Planning and
Deliberation

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that the charge to the jury failed to distinguish between planning and
deliberation.  He stated that the two elements are distinct and must coexist to
support a conviction for first degree murder:  R. v. Nygaard, [1989] 2
S.C.R. 1074, and R. v. Widdifield (1963), 6 Crim. L.Q. 152 (Ont.
H.C.).  Proulx J.A. stated (at p. 177 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  While
""planned"" is understood in the sense of a calculated scheme, the
nature and consequences of which have been considered and weighed, it is still
necessary that the accused, by his deliberation, consider what he has planned,
that is, that he take the time to think about the effect of the act that he
proposes to do.

 

                   For Proulx J.A.,
""deliberate"" or ""propos délibéré"" had to do with
considered reflection once a plan has been formed.  He wrote:  [TRANSLATION] ""the process of deliberation
requires that the accused, as I pointed out, take the time to reflect on
it"".  Proulx J.A. also adopted the following statement from Pilon v.
The Queen (1965), 46 C.R. 272, [1966] 2 C.C.C. 53 (Que. Q.B.), at
p. 69 C.C.C.:

 

[translation]  . . .
the deliberate act [is] one proceeding from an intention and an intelligence
which knows the nature and quality of the criminal act.

 

                   Citing the cases of
More v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 522, McMartin v. The Queen,
[1964] S.C.R. 484, and R. v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471, as authority,
Proulx J.A. determined that it is possible for a murder to be planned but
not deliberate, or deliberate but not planned.  Thus, in his view, if the
murder was planned but the final act was prompted by a sudden impulse rather
than consideration, it would not be deliberate.

 

                   Furthermore, Proulx
J.A. thought that if the murder took place as part of another offence, it was
essential, in the charge to the jury, to avoid any confusion between the
planning and deliberation required for the other offence, and planning and
deliberation required for first degree murder.

 

                   Considering the
whole of the charge to the jury, Proulx J.A. concluded that the trial judge
failed to make these distinctions.  The charge implied that
""deliberate"" was subsumed in the notion of ""planned"". 
Proulx J.A. stated:  [TRANSLATION] ""the trial judge ... only really submitted a single question to
the jury, that is:  was the murder planned, desired, premeditated?"" (p.
182 C.C.C.).  He also noted that the trial judge never defined
""deliberate"".

 

                   Proulx J.A. found
as well that the charge was not clear on the difference between the intention
to kill, and the further intention required for first degree murder.  In his
view by stating that [TRANSLATION] ""a planned murder is a desired or even prepared murder"" (p.
183 C.C.C.) the trial judge failed to distinguish between a premeditated
killing and an intentional killing.

 

                   Proulx J.A. thought
that if the jury was properly instructed the verdict would not necessarily be
the same in this case as the evidence left important questions unanswered.  For
example, did the appellant plan the murder?  Did he deliberate?  In Proulx
J.A.'s opinion, the answers to these questions must be left to a properly
instructed jury.

 

                   (ii)  The
Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   Applying the
principles set out in R. v. Krause, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466, Proulx J.A.
held that the Crown's rebuttal evidence was not admissible, since it only went
to a collateral issue.  In his view, it was not enough that the evidence be
relevant; it had to be important or essential.

 

                   Proulx J.A. noted
that the appellant did not raise new facts in his testimony.  Rather, in his
cross-examination, the respondent introduced the idea that the money which was
found on the appellant when he was arrested came from his welfare allowance. 
The origins of the money was a proper question going to recent possession of
stolen property.  However, Proulx J.A. held that since the appellant had
already admitted that he had stolen money from the victim's person and from the
residence the testimony of the social services people was in no way essential. 
In his opinion, the rebuttal evidence went only to the credibility of the
appellant, and even though credibility was in issue, this did not make rebuttal
evidence on a collateral point admissible:  Krause, supra; John v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 476; Latour v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
361, and R. v. Perry (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont. C.A.).

 

                   (iii)  Manslaughter

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that the trial judge erred in not allowing the issue of manslaughter to be put
to the jury.  In testimony, the appellant stated that he did not intend to kill
the victim.  Thus, since his intent to kill was an issue, Proulx J.A. thought
that manslaughter should have gone to the jury.  He stated that the trial judge
had an obligation to address all defences that arose on the evidence:  Lampard
v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 373, and Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 592.

 

                   (b)  Chouinard
J.A. (concurring with Tourigny J.A.)

 

                   (i)  Planning
and Deliberation

 

                   In light of the
evidence that the appellant knew the victim's daily routine of coming home for
lunch, the appellant's confession and his seizure of firearms as soon as he
broke in, Chouinard J.A. found that the defence theory (of surprise and panic
at the arrival of the victim) lacked credibility.  He stated:  [TRANSLATION] ""Accordingly, the verdict of
first degree murder rendered by the jury seems reasonable, in accordance with
the verdict that a properly instructed jury would have rendered in a similar
case"" (p. 158 C.C.C.).

 

                   While agreeing that
a premeditated crime could still be committed without deliberation, Chouinard
J.A. disagreed with Proulx J.A. that this was an issue in the present case. 
The appellant waited some four hours for the victim to come home, then shot him
eight times.  The Crown's theory was of long preparation and cold, lucid
execution of the plan.  Chouinard J.A. thought that this was a reasonable
inference to be drawn from the evidence and that it was irreconcilable with
fear, surprise and sudden impulse.  The jury obviously rejected the latter
theory.  Furthermore, Chouinard J.A. decided that when read as a whole, the
charge to the jury clearly distinguished the notions of planning and
deliberation.

 

                   (ii) The
Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   Chouinard J.A. held
that the recent possession of the car and the victim's possessions and money at
the time of arrest made the origins of these things an important issue even if
the theft itself was not contested by the accused.

 

                   (c)  Tourigny
J.A.

 

                   (i) The Rebuttal
Evidence

 

                   Tourigny J.A.
thought that in the context of the appellant's claims about the origin of the
money, the rebuttal evidence was admissible.  The facts here differed from Krause,
supra, where there was no evidence of a statement to police, the
contradictions only arose in cross-examination and where the credibility of
Krause went to a collateral point only.  Here, credibility was not incidental;
it was essential, going to mens rea.  Tourigny J.A. held that the
evidence of the social services people could not have been given in the Crown's
case, as the Crown could not have foreseen that the appellant would change his
story.

 

                   Tourigny J.A.
thought that this case was also different from Latour, supra,
where the accused made an alibi defence stating that he had never been to the
place in question.  The Crown brought rebuttal evidence that the accused had
been seen at the location some three months after the crime.  In that case, the
attack on credibility was collateral.  Here, in Tourigny J.A.'s opinion, the
appellant made his credibility a central issue by changing his story on his
intention to steal and intention to kill.

 

                   (ii)  Manslaughter

 

                   Tourigny J.A. held
that the trial judge did not err in not putting manslaughter to the jury as, in
her opinion, there was nothing in the evidence to support such a conviction. 
In any event, the jury decided that it was not second degree murder, nor
constructive murder, but rather, first degree murder.  Tourigny J.A. thought
that this verdict was reasonable, as long as the charge on first degree murder
was adequate.

 

                   (iii) Planning
and Deliberation

 

                   Tourigny J.A. cited
passages from the charge and also reproduced a document that the trial judge
had given to the jury.  This document set out the elements of the offence, and
referred to planning and deliberation as necessary to first degree murder. 
Tourigny J.A. concluded (at p. 174 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  For my part, [I
have to say] I find no error in the instructions given by the judge.  Of
course, as I previously said, he did not each time repeat the exact words but
it appears to me however that, in light of the comments that he made and the
references made to the document he had distributed, the jury could not have
been led to understand anything else than that it was necessary to find the
presence beyond a reasonable doubt of all the constituent elements of first
degree murder, including ""planning and deliberation"".

 

III.  Points in Issue

 

1.Did
the trial judge err in permitting rebuttal evidence to be led by the Crown
concerning whether the appellant had been receiving social assistance?

 

2.Was
the trial judge's charge to the jury adequate with regard to the planned and
deliberate nature of first degree murder?

 

3.Was
the trial judge's charge to the jury insufficient in that he failed to put the
possibility of a conviction of manslaughter to them?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

1.  The Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   In Krause, supra,
this Court set out the principles governing the introduction of rebuttal
evidence.  The general rule is that Crown counsel, in cross-examining an
accused, are not limited to subjects which are strictly relevant to the
essential issues in a case.  Counsel are accorded wide latitude in
cross-examination which enables them to test and question the testimony of the
witnesses and their credibility.  However, where the questions asked by Crown
counsel are not relevant to an issue essential for the determination of the
case, the Crown is bound by the answers given and cannot present evidence in
rebuttal to challenge the statements made by the witness.  The reason for this
rule was stated by McIntyre J. in Krause at pp. 473-74 in the following
words:

 

This
rule prevents unfair surprise, prejudice and confusion which could result if
the Crown or the plaintiff were allowed to split its case, that is, to put in
part of its evidence -- as much as it deemed necessary at the outset -- then to
close the case and after the defence is complete to add further evidence to
bolster the position originally advanced.  The underlying reason for this rule
is that the defendant or the accused is entitled at the close of the Crown's
case to have before it the full case for the Crown so that it is known from the
outset what must be met in response.

 

However, an exception to this rule is
made when the defence has raised some new matter or a defence which the Crown
has had no opportunity to deal with in presenting its case and which the Crown
could not reasonably have anticipated.  McIntyre J. expressed the following
caveat to the exception on p. 474:

 

...
rebuttal will not be permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or
reinforce earlier evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been
brought before the defence was made.  It will be permitted only when it is
necessary to insure that at the end of the day each party will have had an
equal opportunity to hear and respond to the full submissions of the other.

 

He added the following comments
regarding the rule against rebuttal on collateral issues:

 

Where
something new emerges in cross-examination, which is new in the sense that the
Crown had no chance to deal with it in its case-in-chief (i.e., there was no
reason for the Crown to anticipate that the matter would arise), and where
the matter is concerned with the merits of the case (i.e., it concerns an issue
essential for the determination of the case) then the Crown may be allowed
to call evidence in rebuttal.  Where, however, the new matter is collateral,
that is, not determinative of an issue arising in the pleadings or indictment
or not relevant to matters which must be proved for the determination of the
case, no rebuttal will be allowed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In the case at bar,
it has been argued that the rebuttal evidence served only to confirm the fact
that the appellant stole money from the Ford residence.  The appellant admitted
that he robbed the Ford home and therefore, it was argued, the rebuttal evidence
was not determinative of an issue which must be proved in order to come to a
decision in the case.

 

                   In my view, the
crucial question with regard to the admission of rebuttal evidence is not
whether the evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce is determinative of
an essential issue, but rather whether it is related to an essential
issue which may be determinative of the case.  If the reply evidence goes to an
essential element of the case and the Crown could not have foreseen that such
evidence would be necessary, then it is generally admissible.  Thus, if a
statement is made during the course of a witness's testimony at trial which
conflicts with other evidence relating to an essential issue in the case, reply
evidence will be permitted to resolve the conflict.

 

                   It is true that the
Crown cannot split its case to obtain an unfair advantage.  Nor should the
Crown be able to put in evidence in reply on a purely collateral issue. 
However, it is fit and proper that reply evidence be called which relates to an
integral and essential issue of the case.  In such circumstances, it would be
wrong to deprive the trier of fact of important evidence relating to an
essential element of the case.  The course of a trial, particularly a criminal
trial, must be based upon rules of fairness so as to ensure the protection of
the individual accused.  However, the rules should not go so far as to deprive
the trier of fact of important evidence, that can be helpful in resolving an
essential element of the case.

 

                   Let us consider now
the situation presented in this case.  It was essential for the Crown to
establish that the Ford residence had been robbed by Aalders.  It was necessary
to prove both that Aalders planned the robbery and that his killing of
Lawrence Ford was planned and deliberate.  The Crown was anxious to
establish the importance and significance of the robbery to Aalders.  Viewed
realistically the bulk and weight of the articles stolen were such that Aalders
had to obtain a vehicle to transport them.  That, in turn, required Aalders to
wait in the house for the return of Mr. Ford at lunchtime when he could shoot
him and take his vehicle.  Further, in order to demonstrate the significance
and importance of the robbery to Aalders it was necessary for the Crown to show
his possession of and his reliance upon the money he took from the Ford house.

 

                   In his evidence at
trial, Aalders testified that when he first came to the house he did not intend
to rob it but simply to ask Mr. Ford if he could get a ride with him from
the railway station later on.  He admitted that when he went into the house, he
committed the robbery, but he stated that the two five dollar bills, and one
two dollar bill which he had in his possession at the time of his arrest and
which appeared to be quite old, had been given to him by his mother or his
grandmother.  Yet the evidence given by the victim's son indicated that they
might well have come from collection of old bills that was kept by his father
and sister.  As well, Aalders testified that the $141 that he had at the time
of his arrest came from a welfare cheque which he had received and cashed. 
Thus the robbery was made to appear as something that was spontaneous, carried
out upon the spur of the moment and an incident that was relatively unimportant
to Aalders as he had alternative sources of funds.

 

                   The Crown would
have had no way of knowing that he would testify in that manner in light of his
earlier statement.  It is not a sufficient answer to say that Aalders admitted
the robbery because even though he did admit it, he denied important aspects of
the robbery.  This denial presented the robbery in a manner that was not only
more favourable to Aalders but also was false and misleading.  The evidence
from the welfare officials that he had never received welfare payments was
relevant and important because it would establish that the robbery was, in all
probability, the source of all the money in his possession at the time of his
arrest.  This evidence was also significant to the charge of murder as it could
lead to the reasonable inference that the robbery was of importance to
Aalders.  It can be inferred from the evidence that the murder of Ford in order
to obtain his car was an integral part of the robbery.  Evidence as to the
details of the robbery formed an important part of the Crown's case.  The
nature and details of the robbery did not constitute a collateral issue, but
rather an integral and essential aspect of the case.  In the circumstances of
this case, it was appropriate that the Crown call evidence in reply to
demonstrate the importance of the robbery to Aalders.

 

                   The reason for
permitting evidence to be led in reply in this case is not simply that the
reply will affect the credibility of Aalders for all testimony in a case will,
to some extent, be subject to testing for its credibility.  Rather, it is the
fact that the evidence goes to an integral element of the case coupled with the
recognition that the Crown could not have foreseen the accused would testify in
this way which makes the evidence admissible in reply.  The bald admission of
the robbery in the course of evidence which falsely coloured its nature and
changed important details cannot result in a finding that the reply evidence
thereby goes solely to collateral issues.  The statements given by Aalders to
the police which were admitted in the trial, varied from his testimony, and it
was important that any confusion with regard to the statements and his
testimony on this essential issue be clarified.  This could only be done by way
of reply.  It cannot then be said that the reply evidence constituted the
splitting of the Crown's case.

 

                   The appellant
relied upon two authorities to support his position.  The first of these was Krause,
supra.  As I have indicated, the admission of the reply evidence in this
case does not offend any of the principles put forward in Krause.  It
is, as well, important to take into account the very different factual
background which was presented in the Krause case.  Krause had testified
not only with regard to the circumstances which surrounded the murder but also
with respect to his involvement with the police during the course of the murder
investigation.  Crown counsel cross-examined Krause about his statements to the
police and then applied, pursuant to s. 11  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
to call rebuttal evidence at the conclusion of the case for the defence.

 

                   It was observed by
McIntyre J., writing on behalf of the unanimous Court, that the trial judge had
erred in admitting and permitting the cross- examination on the statement to
the police as there had been no inconsistent statement made by the accused in
the course of his testimony.  Furthermore, it was held that the evidence in
respect of which rebuttal had been permitted dealt with the accused's assertion
that the police had harassed him before his arrest.  This, it was found, was a
collateral issue that was neither material nor relevant to a decision as to
whether the accused had killed the victim.  It reflected only on the integrity
of the police and did not touch on the guilt or innocence of Krause.  That
factual situation is a far cry from the one presented in this case.  In the
case at bar, the reply evidence concerned an issue essential for the
determination of the case.

 

                   The appellant also
relied upon Latour, supra.  Latour had been charged with the robbery of
a jewellery store.  During the trial it was asserted that he had an alibi.  In
attempting to challenge this defence, the Crown asked Latour whether he had
ever been in a particular jewellery store on specified dates three months
subsequent to the robbery.  The Crown led rebuttal evidence relating only to
the collateral issue as to his presence in another jewellery store on a later
date.  There it was held that the rebuttal evidence should not have been
permitted as it did not deal with any issues relating to the robbery or to the
alibi or indeed to any other material issue presented in the case.  The sole
purpose of the rebuttal evidence was to discredit the appellant's testimony by attacking
his credibility on a purely collateral issue.  It was therefore improper and
inadmissible.  Once again that case is very different and readily
distinguishable from the one at bar where the rebuttal evidence dealt with an
essential issue that was integral to the Crown's case.

 

2.  The Adequacy of the Charge on
First Degree Murder

 

                   There can be no
doubt that the aspect of planning and deliberation are separate elements of the
crime of murder in the first degree, both of which must be established beyond a
reasonable doubt.  In More, supra, Cartwright J. (as he then was) stated
at pp. 533-34:

 

                   The
evidence that the murder was planned was very strong, but, as was properly
pointed out to the jury by the learned trial judge, they could not find the
accused guilty of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt not only that the murder was planned but also that it was deliberate. 
The learned trial judge also rightly instructed the jury that the word
""deliberate"", as used in s. 202A (2)(a), means
""considered not impulsive"".

 

                   Other
meanings of the adjective given in the Oxford Dictionary are ""not hasty in
decision"", ""slow in deciding"" and ""intentional"".  The
word as used in the subsection cannot have simply the meaning
""intentional"" because it is only if the accused's act was intentional
that he can be guilty of murder and the subsection is creating an additional
ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused being convicted of capital
murder.

 

                   It is the
appellant's contention that the trial judge failed to adequately distinguish
between the elements of planning and deliberation.  I cannot accept that
contention.  It is apparent, when the charge is read as a whole, that the jury
was properly instructed with regard to the elements of planning and
deliberation.  On several occasions, the trial judge told the jury that in
order to convict the appellant of first degree murder, they had to find that
the act had been [TRANSLATION]
""planned and desired"".  In the written description of the elements of
first degree murder which the trial judge gave to the jury, it was clearly
indicated in the last paragraph of that document that the Crown had to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing involved [TRANSLATION] ""planning and
deliberation"".  This instruction was repeated several times to the jury. 
As an example, the following instruction given to the jury properly conveys the
distinct meanings of the words planned and deliberate:

 

                   [translation]  In criminal
law, then, the expression ""planned and deliberate"" means:  the
carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful
act.  So it is the commission of an unlawful act after having thought about
it.  It is an act which is planned and desired.

 

                   The jury submitted
a question on planning and deliberation.  It is, of course, important that a
trial judge respond to questions from the jury accurately and with reasonable
detail.  It is the position of the appellant that there was some confusion
created by the response of the trial judge to this question.  Yet the response
is, I think, adequate.  In defining the word [TRANSLATION] ""planned"", the trial judge
stated:

 

[translation]  Often instead
of always using the full expression ""planned and deliberate"", it is
summarized by saying ""planned, prepared in advance, having thought about
it in advance, having thought about something in advance"", and that's
about it for planning.

 

                   This instruction
was, I think, particularly appropriate in light of the facts of the case.  The
position of the Crown throughout the trial was that there had been long and
careful preparations for the robbery and murder and that it was carried out in
a cold and calculated manner.  I agree with the description put forward in the
reasons of Chouinard J.A., at p. 159 C.C.C. where he wrote:

 

[translation]  These two
elements were, in the present case, particularly interconnected.  How, in
effect, can one conceive that the victim's murder, carried out as it was, could
in the jury's mind have been isolated from the notion of commission which was
described at length, and thereby limited to planning?  The theory of the
prosecution, I repeat, alleged lengthy preparation and cold‑blooded and
lucid execution.

 

                   The directions
given to the jury by the trial judge on the issue of planning and deliberation
were quite clear that they were separate concepts, that is to say, distinct
elements of first degree murder both of which had to be established beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Importantly, his reply to the jury's question was lengthy
and detailed.  He repeated his original instructions and reviewed again the
written statement he had left with the jury.  Both his oral and written
instructions pointed to the need for the Crown to establish, beyond any
reasonable doubt, the elements of both planning and deliberation.

 

3.  Manslaughter

 

                   The appellant
submits that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that manslaughter
was an alternative verdict.  If there was evidence which had ""an air of
reality"" which indicated that Aalders did not intend to kill
Lawrence Ford or did not intend to cause him bodily harm which he knew was
likely to cause his death, then manslaughter should have been left to the jury
as an alternative verdict.  See R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, and R. v. Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
265.

 

                   The evidence put
forward is the testimony of Aalders to the effect that he did not wish to kill
Mr. Ford but only to shoot him in the legs.  I cannot see that there was
any air of reality to this testimony when it is viewed in the context of all
the evidence in this case.

 

                   The appellant
arrived at the Ford residence at 8:00 a.m.  He was familiar with the Ford
family routine and was well aware that no one would be home at that time.  He
broke into the home and immediately secured and loaded the 30.30 rifle which he
used at once to silence the dog.  He then armed himself with the smaller, more
convenient .32 calibre pistol.  Next he made a careful search for ammunition
for the handgun both upstairs and in the basement.  He shot the lock off a
chest and obtained more ammunition for it.  He loaded it and placed it in his
belt.  In his own evidence he did this so that he would not be surprised in the
course of his robbery.  He gathered together all the stolen articles and placed
them by the back door.

 

                   It is hard to
imagine that he could not have removed the stolen goods earlier, taken them to
the woods or left the premises with the money had he wished to do so.  Yet he
lay in wait for the return of Lawrence Ford which he knew must be around
noon, over four hours after he had broken into the house.  He took care to
conceal himself in the bathroom.  When Ford saw his slain dog and turned back towards
the bathroom, Aalders advanced towards him firing the gun.  Eight bullets
entered Ford's body.  Only one was in the area of the legs; the rest were in
the torso and neck.  Ford was executed, his death insured by the repeated shots
that were fired into his body.  In those circumstances I can see no air of
reality whatsoever to Aalders' testimony such that it could possibly be said to
raise the defence of manslaughter.  This killing has every indication of being
a cold blooded, planned and deliberate execution.  It follows that it would not
have been appropriate to have left manslaughter to the jury.

 

V.  Conclusion and Disposition

 

                   The evidence called
in reply by the Crown was properly admitted.  The directions to the jury on
planning and deliberation were adequate.  There was no air of reality to the
defence of manslaughter.  In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- The
appellant argued that the trial judge erred in allowing rebuttal evidence which
contradicted the appellant's assertion (made on cross-examination) that he
received certain monies from social assistance.  This Court addressed the rules
applicable to rebuttal evidence in R. v. Krause, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466. 
McIntyre J. stated (at p. 474):

 

                   The
plaintiff or the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal after
completion of the defence case, where the defence has raised some new matter or
defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to deal with and which the Crown
or the plaintiff could not reasonably have anticipated.  But rebuttal will not
be permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or reinforce earlier
evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been brought before the defence
was made.  It will be permitted only when it is necessary to insure that at the
end of the day each party will have had an equal opportunity to hear and
respond to the full submissions of the other.

 

                   In
the cross-examination of witnesses essentially the same principles apply. 
Crown counsel in cross-examining an accused are not limited to subjects which
are strictly relevant to the essential issues in a case.  Counsel are accorded
a wide freedom in cross-examination which enable them to test and question the
testimony of the witnesses and their credibility.  Where something new emerges
in cross-examination, which is new in the sense that the Crown had no chance to
deal with it in its case-in-chief (i.e., there was no reason for the Crown to anticipate
that the matter would arise), and where the matter is concerned with the merits
of the case (i.e., it concerns an issue essential for the determination of
the case) then the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal. 
Where, however, the new matter is collateral, that is, not determinative of an
issue arising in the pleadings or indictment or not relevant to matters which
must be proved for the determination of the case, no rebuttal will be allowed. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The relationship between
cross-examination and rebuttal were similarly described in McCormick on
Evidence (4th ed. 1992), vol. 1, at pp. 182-83:

 

                   On
cross-examination, every permissible type of impeachment that may be employed
during cross-examination has as one of its purposes the testing of the
credibility of the witness.  The use of extrinsic evidence to contradict is
more restricted due to considerations of confusion of the issues, misleading
the jury, undue consumption of time, and unfair prejudice raised by the introduction
of so-called collateral matters.  If a matter is considered collateral, the
testimony of the witness on direct or cross-examination stands -- the
cross-examiner must take the witness' answer; extrinsic evidence, i.e.,
evidence offered other than through the witness himself, in contradiction is
not permitted.  If the matter is not collateral, extrinsic evidence may be
introduced disputing the witness' testimony on direct examination or denial of
truth of the facts asserted in a question propounded on cross-examination.

 

                   The respondent
argued that the rebuttal evidence was justified because of discrepancies
between the appellant's statement to the police and his testimony.  In his
declaration to the police, the appellant stated that he went to the Ford house
to break in.  In testimony, he stated that he went to ask the deceased a
favour.  In the declaration, the appellant said nothing about aiming the gun at
the deceased's legs.  In testimony, the appellant stated that he aimed the gun
at the deceased's legs and that he did not intend to kill him.  The declaration
said nothing about the origins of funds found in the appellant's possession
upon arrest.  In direct examination, the appellant claimed that certain old
bank notes were given to him by his mother or his grandmother.  In
cross-examination, the appellant claimed that other funds in his possession
were from a social assistance cheque.  The rebuttal evidence of two social
welfare workers was that the appellant had never received social assistance, and
that his applications for social assistance had been refused.

 

                   The respondent took
the position that the appellant denied having any intention to commit robbery,
and that the rebuttal evidence showed recent possession of stolen property
which was essential to prove that the robbery was intentional.  The respondent
relied on the reasoning of Tourigny J.A., who held that the appellant's
testimony [translation] ""...
would be to the effect that he went to the Ford residence without any criminal
intent and, à la rigueur, there perhaps was not even a break, enter and
theft"" ([1991] R.J.Q. 2097, 69 C.C.C. (3d) 154, at p. 168 C.C.C.).  With
respect, the evidence does not support this analysis.  Although the appellant
did change his story with respect to his intentions in going to the Ford house
initially, he never changed his story with respect to the actual robbery.  The
rebuttal evidence was only relevant to this second point, which had been
admitted by the appellant.

 

                   In his testimony in
chief, the appellant specifically admitted robbing the deceased's house and
robbing the deceased's person:

 

[translation]  I searched in
his pockets until I found the keys.

 

His
wallet was in the same pocket, so I took it out, opened it and took all the
money inside it.  I went back downstairs and took the money, weapons and wine
and took all of this upstairs.  I took the keys and opened the trunk of the car
and put everything in the trunk, and closed it ....

 

After
that, I got into the car, started the engine and drove away from the house.

 

On cross-examination, the appellant
was not directly challenged on these points, nor did the appellant attempt to
deny the robbery.  Rather, he continued to admit it, as the following exchange
indicates:

 

                   [translation]

Q.The
money you took:  there were American notes, were there any Canadian notes?

 

A.I
think so.

 

                   The rebuttal
evidence of the social welfare workers was not relevant to the appellant's
assertion that he did not intend to kill the deceased, and it was wholly unnecessary
to prove the robbery, as this had been admitted by the appellant's own
testimony.  The respondent had the right to cross-examine the appellant on
collateral facts, in order to attack his credibility, but having done so the
respondent had to take the appellant's answers.  Put in context, the rebuttal
evidence attacked the appellant's credibility on the sole question of whether
he was a recipient of social assistance, a collateral issue which was raised
for the first time in cross-examination.

 

                   The respondent also
relied on the reasons of Tourigny J.A. arguing that the appellant made his
credibility a central issue by giving testimony which differed from his police
statement.  Tourigny J.A. stated (at p. 168 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  Aalders'
credibility, by the choice that he himself had made to change his story and not
in the framework of cross‑examination, becomes an issue which is not
collateral or incidental, but an important issue.

 

                   In any case where
the accused testifies, his credibility will be on the line.  Allowing rebuttal
evidence simply because the accused has chosen to make his credibility an issue
is far too broad an interpretation of Krause.  I agree with Proulx J.A. 
who stated (at p. 187 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  In the present
case, the appellant did not deny that he had taken moneys found on the victim's
person as well as in his residence.  In fact, the appellant had admitted it in
his statement and in his testimony; the judge, in his charge to the jury, even
took this fact for granted.  In this context, how could it be relevant
and important or essential to the determination of the case to
show that, contrary to what the appellant stated, the money found in his
possession at the time of his arrest, that is three days after the
commission of the theft and the homicide, did not come from Welfare?  [Emphasis
in original.]

 

                   An error of this
nature cannot be cured by application of the proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  In John v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 476, this Court stated (at pp. 481-82):

 

                   Section
613(1)(b)(iii) [now s. 686(1) (b)(iii)] of the Criminal Code 
cannot be invoked in these circumstances.  The reviewing tribunal cannot, with
anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth of the
residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been extracted from
the record.  The appellate tribunal does not have the advantage of seeing the
witnesses, and in any case, was never intended in the criminal process to
replace the jury.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Daniel Cakovski, pleaded guilty upon arraignment before Barr J on 5 May 2005 to the crime of the manslaughter of Eugene Victorovich Petroff at Strathfield on 20 May 2001. The matter was fixed for hearing before me on 24 June 2005, but on 21 June 2005, on the application of Mr Terracini of Senior Counsel for the offender, I adjourned the sentencing proceedings until 19 August 2005. That date was subsequently altered to 26 August 2005. The purpose of the adjournment was to afford Mr Terracini the opportunity to introduce medical evidence on behalf of the offender. 
     
      
    2 A statement of agreed facts was tendered before this Court as Exhibit A. The content of that statement I now record: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of these criminal proceedings, the abovenamed Accused, upon the advice of his lawyer, and the Crown have agreed upon the following facts pursuant to section 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): 
        
       
       
        
        1. Eugene Petroff was pronounced deceased at 8.15 am on 20 May 2001. The cause of death was the combined effect of four stab wounds to the chest and an incised wound to the face. The two most significant wounds were one, with a depth of about 80 mm, penetrating the right lung, and another, with a depth of about 120 mm, passing through the heart. All the wounds were inflicted by the accused between about 5.25 am and 5.50 am on 20 May 2001, in Parnell Street, Strathfield, near Strathfield Railway Station. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The deceased had attended a reunion at the Russian Club in Strathfield commencing at about 7.30 pm on 19 May 2001, during which he had consumed alcohol. There was evidence that, by the time he left the club, he was considerably affected by alcohol, and this was confirmed by a very high blood alcohol level measured after his death. Between 11 pm and midnight on 19 May 2001, the deceased had assaulted a guest at the reunion, George Logounov, and had threatened to kill him. The deceased asked Logounov  
        ‘How would you like a knife in your head? I’m going to kill you like I killed the other three people’ 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        3. On 19 September 1978 the deceased murdered three people. The accused was not aware of this at the time of the incident with the deceased. On the date of the murders, the deceased, then aged 31, had been involved in dealing in narcotics and believed that he had been cheated by certain of his associates in the drug trade. As a consequence, he had shot one person at Wetherill Park and had then driven to Burwood where he shot two other people. At the time of the murders, the deceased was affected by alcohol. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The deceased left the club at about 2 am on 20 May 2001, and after sitting for some time with two other men on a bench near the entrance to the Railway Station, he was left by them at the station between about 2.30 am and 3.00 am. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The accused had met a friend Sonja Sekulovska at Bankstown RSL Club on the evening of 19 May 2001, and had then gone with her in her car to Kings Cross. Both she and the accused gave evidence to the effect that, shortly after the commencement of this journey, the appellant consumed some Rohypnol pills; and that at Kings Cross they purchased and then injected some heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        6. At about 2.10 am on 20 May 2001, Constable Venables observed Ms Sekulovska’s car make a left turn in Stanmore contrary to a one-way sign. The car was driven by the accused. Constable Venables asked the accused to produce his licence and identification, but the accused was unable to produce either. In a statement prepared by Constable Venables on 20 June 2001, he stated that at this time ‘I conducted a search of him. No item found on his possession’. The accused was then taken to Newtown Police Station and issued with a traffic infringement notice. The accused and Ms Sekulovska then went to Strathfield in Ms Sekulovska’s car. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Video surveillance showed the car in The Boulevard, Strathfield, in the vicinity of the corner of Parnell Street, at 5.07 am on 20 May 2001; and showed both the accused and Ms Sekulovska at various times between 5.07 am and 5.25 am leaving the car and entering a 7-Eleven Convenience Store on this corner. Ms Sekulovska spoke to the deceased in the convenience store, at a time when the accused was outside or in the car. Ms Sekulovska, after she had spoken to the deceased in the convenience store, went back to the car, and she and the accused agreed that she would lure the deceased into Parnell Street so that they could rob him. 
        
       
       
        
        8. Ms Sekulovska returned to the 7-Eleven Convenience Store and later walked with the deceased into Parnell Street. Some time later the accused approached Ms Sekulovska and the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        9. There was a fight between the accused and the deceased, and Ms Sekulovska ran away. She got into the car. As she started to drive off she saw the accused running towards her. The accused got into the car and they both drove away. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The accused was arrested on the morning of 20 May at Condell Park, but not charged with murder on that occasion. The knife used to stab the deceased was found nearby: this knife had a blade about 10 cm long. Upon examination, the knife was found to have a fingerprint of the accused on it and the same DNA profile as that of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        11. On 16 June 2001, pursuant to a warrant, police monitored a conversation between the accused and Ms Sekulovska, which included the following exchange: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Accused: ‘I’m the one who killed the poor cunt.’ 
          
         
         
          
          Sekulovska: ‘Did you mean it?’ 
          
         
         
          
          Accused: ‘No. Yeah I did. No, I didn’t probably…you know when I think about it I spin out, I think to myself ‘Fuck I’m a murderer, that’s fucked mate’. 
          
         
         
          
          Sekulovska: ‘Fucken asshole tried to kick you.’ 
          
         
         
          
          Accused: ‘I’ve still got the scars on my legs from kicking…they’re all from that son-of-a-bitch and he laughed at me. He goes, “the knife isn’t even sharp” and I went “yeah” and I go whack, whack, whack – I stabbed him about six times.’ 
          
         
         
          
          Sekulovska: ‘It says that he was stabbed in the face and chest.’ 
          
         
         
          
          Accused: ‘No, I slashed the face from there open…if they found him earlier, he might not have died. When I think about it, man I shouldn’t have shanked him, shouldn’t have stabbed the poor cunt.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        12. The accused was charged with the murder of Mr Petroff on 19 June 2001. The accused was interviewed on videotape, but declined to continue with the interview after he disclaimed all knowledge of the death of Mr Petroff. He declined to take part in an identification parade. 
        
       
       
        
        13. At the first trial, the accused gave his account of the incident with the deceased. The accused said that he approached the deceased and Ms Sekulovska. The deceased told him to leave and when he refused, the deceased kicked him in the shin and in the groin. The deceased said; ‘Now you’re gonna die. I’m gonna kill you… Now I’m gonna kill you.’ The accused said that he was then on ‘all fours’ on the ground and that he ‘dry retched’. The accused then said that he saw the knife on the ground which he grabbed and removed it from the sheath at which stage the deceased said: ‘What do you think you’re gonna do with that?…no matter what you do, you’re gonna die.’ 
        
       
       
        
        The accused stated that he thought he was going to die. He said that he got to his knees and swung the knife in the direction of the deceased and then got to his feet, and that the deceased ‘came’ at him three times, despite the accused attempting to ward the deceased off with the knife, and that ‘all I knew was that this man (the deceased) was going to kill me…I’d swung the knife at him to try and keep him away from me, and no matter what I did…he wouldn’t leave me…I’d try and step back and he’d attack at me again, and by this stage I didn’t know what to do. I swung the knife in the air just towards his face and it got him, it got him in the face and he kind of looked shocked, you know ‘you cut me’ and he grabbed his face and he started moving back. Finally he took four, five steps back and I just – I left. As soon as he moved back I took off. That was my first chance to get away. I didn’t run, I limped because I couldn’t run…’” 
        
       
      
    3 The offender stood trial charged with the murder of the deceased, having pleaded not guilty to that charge. On 3 July 2002 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of murder, and the offender was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eighteen years with a non parole period of twelve years. (There was some adjustment for time spent in custody which it is not immediately necessary to record.) 
     
      
    4 The offender appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and that appeal was successful. The conviction was quashed and a new trial was ordered. For reasons that are not altogether clear, the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter in March 2005 and an indictment was presented accordingly. Before me on 26 August 2005, the Crown said: “The plea was taken upon instructions” (T 1, 26 August 2005). The basis of acceptance of this plea appears to have been that this was a case of excessive self defence. The Court is required to sentence the offender upon this basis. 
     
      
    5 It is to be noted that four knife wounds were inflicted by the offender, one of them penetrating the right lung and the other passing through the heart. Having inflicted those wounds, the offender took flight. 
     
      
    6 It is clear from the agreed statement of facts that the offender approached the victim in pursuance of the plan to rob him. It was a plan that went wrong and resulted in the taking of a human life. The killing involved the use of a knife and it has to be regarded as a serious crime. Having inflicted the serious wounds that caused death, the offender took no steps to see that aid reached his victim. 
     
      
    7 The maximum penalty provided for by s 24 of the Crimes Act for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    8 The offender was born on 30 December 1981, so that he was nineteen years of age when he committed this crime and he is presently twenty-three years of age. He has a criminal record, but the first offences as an adult, although they were committed on 30 August 2000, did not attract punishment until a term of imprisonment of two months was imposed on 1 November 2002. Those offences for which concurrent sentences were imposed were drive a conveyance taken without consent, refusing to allow a sample of blood to be taken and failing to provide a sample of urine. Fines for traffic offences were also imposed at that time. On 11 May 2001, eight days before the crime of manslaughter, the offender was charged with resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and driving whilst suspended. For those matters, he was placed upon a two year bond on 8 August 2002. A further offence committed on 11 May 2001 led to a term of imprisonment being imposed on 8 August 2002 for a term of three months. That was an offence of driving recklessly. The offender’s record further reveals that in May 2000 he was charged with possession of equipment for administering prohibited drugs and self administering. He was dealt with by fine for those matters. Then, on 11 May 2001 he was charged with shoplifting and was sentenced to one month imprisonment on 1 November 2002. On 20 May 2001, the day after the commission of the crime presently under consideration, the offender was charged with being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, and on 10 December 2002 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years with a non parole period of one year six months. 
     
      
    9 I have set out the detail of that criminal history in full. However, I am mindful of the fact that there was no offence of significance attracting a term of imprisonment prior to the date upon which the offender caused the death of the deceased. The real significance of the record is that there were periods after the offender was taken into custody during which he was serving sentences for other matters. The starting date for the sentence must be adjusted to take account of this.  
     
      
    10 Two pre-sentence reports have been introduced into evidence. The earlier report, Exhibit F, bears date 29 November 2002. It refers to a time at which the offender first came into contact with the Probation and Parole Service in May 2001, at that time for driving offences. However, there is some reference in that report to the incident leading to the death of the deceased. The offender asserted to the author of the report that he acted in self defence, but said that he had been carrying the knife used because five days earlier he had been stabbed in the left arm, where the author observed obvious scarring. The offender said that he carried the knife as a form of protection. 
     
      
    11 The more recent Probation and Parole report tendered bears date 26 August 2005. This report discloses that the offender is a single man who is in a relationship which his fiancée described as “close and stable” The offender’s mother and sister spoke to the author of the report in relation to the offender in endearing terms, but adverted to past associations of the offender with unsavoury individuals. The earlier report referred to the offender’s long history of drug use, which commenced with cannabis at the age of thirteen and progressed to ecstasy by the age of fourteen. At the age of fifteen, the offender had started to use heroin. The later report discloses that the offender has had a stormy period in custody, having been found guilty of six institutional misconduct charges since he was first imprisoned in 2001. The offender’s misconduct has, according to the report, extended to threatening staff and other inmates. He has been aggressive, threatening and antagonistic, although it is suggested that there has been some change in attitude. The offender became interested in Islam, to which he claims to have converted over three years ago. He perceives himself since that time to have become more focussed and clear-headed. The imam who is the spiritual leader for the Muslim inmates in custody has noted improvement in the offender’s attitude.  
     
      
    12 The author of the report wrote (at pp 6-7 of the report dated 24 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Cakovski initially presented as an angry and impulsive young man who tries hard to impress those around him whom he admires, or whom he sees as beneficial to him. He also appeared somewhat immature with a tendency to minimize his responsibilities. 
        
       
       
        
        However his time in custody appears to have put a crack in the drug using lifestyle he had been in for some 6 or 7 years, and caused him to pause and take stock of the direction in which he was heading. Although, possibly due to his immaturity and desire to impress those with influence in the criminal world, he has continued to make poor choices in custody and display aggression, which has led to his lengthy placement in segregation. Despite this, enquiries with a number of sources and even his presentation during interviews for this report, do suggest that he has recognized a need to alter his behaviour and in fact, he has already commenced making some significant changes. Mr Cakovski has also shown an eagerness to utilize the resources around him, such as education staff, the psychologist and the Imam, to assist him in making changes in his life. 
        
       
       
        
        However the overall picture appears to be that of an impressionable young man who has been entrenched in unhelpful and damaging behaviours, and who is now on a steep learning curve and attempting to find his way out. Therefore it would seem imperative that while he is in custody, he participate in programmes on offer such as drug and alcohol, anger management and the Violent Offenders Treatment Programme, to better equip him and assist him in continuing to change before he is released back to the community.” 
        
       
      
    13 The offender gave no evidence on the hearing on sentence. The evidence tendered on his behalf comprised two reports, being a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Carne, and a report of a psychologist, Mr Smith. 
     
      
    14 Dr Carne assessed the offender for the first time on 30 September 2002 and for the second time on 4 May 2005. Dr Carne obtained a history of drug abuse commencing at the age of thirteen and also abuse of alcohol commencing at the same time. The content of the report indicates that Dr Carne was largely dependent upon the history taken from the offender. He noted that the offender expressed remorse for the death of the deceased, an expression which has not been repeated by the offender in evidence in this Court.  
     
      
    15 It is to be noted when Dr Carne saw the offender recently on 4 May 2005 the offender gave what the doctor remarked was an almost identical account of the alleged offence. The offender told Dr Carne that the knife which he used in self defence was a knife in his possession which he “pulled out” in self defence and it fell to the ground and he picked it up and used it in self defence.  
     
      
    16 The offender told Dr Carne he had the support of his parents and would be provided with work by his father when released from custody. Neither parent gave evidence. 
     
      
    17 On the occasion of his first assessment, Dr Carne formed the opinion that the offender was suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which led to impulsive behaviour and poor concentration. Dr Carne did not revisit that diagnosis in the later report. 
     
      
    18 Mr Smith interviewed the offender on 30 August 2002. I have considered his report of 1 September 2002. Mr Smith’s report was largely based upon matters of history obtained from the offender, but I record Mr Smith’s impressions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Cakovski impresses as a man of adequate interpersonal and social skills. He is a man who clearly has developed his young adult personality negotiating his existence on the streets and in the drug subcultures. He impresses as undersocialised and emotionally immature. Reading between the lines there is a very high likelihood that he has progressed into adulthood suffering ADHD and this is the reason for the early parental management conflicts with him. He has had little opportunity to allow his underlying personality to emerge from his early adolescent rage and later adolescent haze of drug addictions. He presents as a man whose adult identity is either poorly or under formed. He lacks definition about himself, his ambitions and his identity. It would seem that he has lived his life avoiding rejections, failure and criticism. He seems to have little understanding of or insight into his emotional life or his underlying needs. He impresses as having much adaptive intelligence although he seems to be concrete and literal in his thinking processes. He accounts for his lot in life as the result of the ostracisating of his parents when he was aged twelve years and then having to rely on his instincts to survive over the years. He accounts for his poor adjustment and lifestyle over the past four yeas as the result of narcotic and other dependencies. He is informed about his responsibility in relation to his offending, his current life situation and the legal processes he is facing.” 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Smith concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the history provided in interview, the  
        prognosis 
         of Mr Cakovski will be heavily dependent on him undertaking a longer-term residential drug counselling programme. He has some supports in his family however the extent of these could not be gauged. He presents as being concerned about the direction of his life and sees this point as a watershed with the enforced changes via his incarceration. He argues that his adjustment in custody has been positive however it is vitally important that he undertake long term rehabilitation if any confidence is to be gained in his ongoing adaptation.” 
        
       
      
    20 I do not derive particular assistance from the reports of Dr Carne or of Mr Smith. These reports are largely based upon matters of history obtained from the offender and, as I pointed out to Mr Terracini in the course of the hearing, I was not minded to be influenced by self-serving assertions in matters of history given by the offender unless those assertions were verified by evidence in the witness box. No such evidence was given. 
     
      
    21 Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 defines the purposes for which a sentence may be imposed as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
        
       
      
    22 That section applies in this case notwithstanding the fact that the offence was committed prior to the introduction of the section into the statute. In any event, s 3A only records what were considered to be well-settled objectives in sentencing prior to the introduction of the section. 
     
      
    23 I remind myself of the provisions of s 21A of the statute which also apply in this case.  
     
      
    24 The Crown has referred to the use of the knife as an aggravating feature of the offence: s 21A(2)(c). This is a feature to be taken into account in weighing the gravity of the crime. The Crown submitted that the offence was one that should be regarded as having been committed in company. However, whilst the offender’s companion and the offender had agreed that the companion would lure the deceased to a place where they could rob him, the companion did not participate in the fight between the offender and the deceased but ran away. 
     
      
    25 It would seem that the offender was on bail for a number of minor matters at the time the offence was committed, and this is a matter to be taken into account under s 21A(2)(j). 
     
      
    26 It is proper to have regard to the fact that the offender attended the location where the fight occurred pursuant to the plan made with his companion to rob the deceased, and the offender attended that location armed with the knife used in the attack. That he was so armed does not emerge directly from the agreed statement of facts, where, in para 13, the offender refers to observing the knife on the ground. In written submissions, the Crown invited the Court to proceed upon the basis that the offender was armed with the knife at the time that he approached the deceased and, of course, Mr Terracini had the opportunity of responding to that. In each of the reports tendered by Mr Terracini there is recorded as a matter of history the offender’s prior possession of the weapon before he picked it up from the ground. The offender told Mr Smith that he had secreted the knife in his sock, and that when the deceased kicked him the offender, whilst on the ground, “grabbed my knife” (see para 2 of that report). Dr Carne recorded that the offender told him in September 2002 that he had a fishing knife and that when the deceased kicked him in the groin his knife fell to the ground and he grabbed it and swung at his assailant (p 4 of the longer report of 18 July 2005). Then, in the second report of 18 July 2005 referable to the further consultation on 4 May 2005, Dr Carne recorded that the offender told him that the deceased threatened to kill him and started kicking him, that the offender pulled out his knife in self defence, and when the offender grabbed it the deceased continued kicking and threatening the offender, and that the stabbing took place in self defence. According to Exhibit F, as earlier observed, the offender told the author of the Probation and Parole Report of 22 November 2002 that he carried the knife for protection, having himself been stabbed in the left arm five days previously. 
     
      
    27 It is to be taken into account in the offender’s favour that he pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter on 29 March 2005, that date having been fixed as the trial date by Barr J on 21 February 2005. The offender is to be given credit for the utilitarian value of that plea, and Mr Terracini submitted that a twenty-five percent discount of the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed is warranted by reason of that plea. Such a discount in my opinion would be an excessive one. 
     
      
    28 The offender stood trial for murder, having pleaded not guilty on the presentation of an indictment on 18 June 2002. He was convicted by the jury on 3 July 2002 and then pursued an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal which was successful. That court ordered a new trial on 19 August 2004. The first discussions concerning a plea of manslaughter occurred in February 2005. It was accepted that there had been no approach to the Crown concerning the plea ultimately accepted prior to the first trial. 
     
      
    29 I do not consider in the circumstances of this case that the plea entered evidences remorse. By entering the plea the offender eliminated the risk of a conviction for the crime of murder at a second trial. Although the offender expressed remorse to Dr Carne and to Mr Smith, and he expressed his regret as to what had happened in the conversation referred to in the agreed statement of facts, the offender remained silent in this Court. I do not find genuine remorse as a feature to be taken into account in the offender’s favour. 
     
      
    30 Nevertheless, the plea has utilitarian value. The plea was late, and whilst I accept that it was entered into when the Crown determined to accept it, the possibility of a plea was not raised until very shortly before the trial was set to commence. 
     
      
    31 In all the circumstances, I propose to allow a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of approximately fifteen percent. 
     
      
    32 I have referred earlier to the offender’s record and to his past addiction to drugs and alcohol. Having reflected on such evidence as is available, and notwithstanding what the author of the pre sentence report wrote on 24 August 2005 (see para 12 above), I am not persuaded that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are particularly favourable. 
     
      
    33 Mr Terracini submitted that I should find special circumstances. The offender is a relatively young man and he has been in custody continuously since 19 June 2001, albeit for a considerable proportion of that period in relation to other matters. Mr Terracini further submitted that the offender will require a lengthy period of supervision when he is released. On balance, having regard to the offender’s age and the time spent in custody already, I am persuaded that special circumstances exist for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, the adjustment of the ratio will be a very minor one, because I consider that the offender should not have the opportunity of serving any lesser period in custody than the minimum term I am about to impose. This is because of the necessity to recognise the gravity of his crime. Moreover, I consider the sentence I am shortly to put in place will afford an adequate opportunity for release on parole. 
     
      
    34 It is, of course, well recognised that the appropriate range of sentence in any individual case where the crime of manslaughter is concerned is extremely difficult to ascertain: see Regina v Blacklidge (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). 
     
      
    35 In Regina v Trevenna 149 A Crim R 505, the Court of Criminal Appeal entertained a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed in a case of excessive self defence. The appeal was unsuccessful, but in Trevenna a review was undertaken of sentences in manslaughter cases, in particular where excessive self defence was involved. 
     
      
    36 In his judgment in Trevenna Barr J identified three sentences imposed for self defence manslaughter since the introduction of Pt II Div 3 of the Crimes Act: Regina v Cioban [2003] NSWCCA 304; Regina v Nguyen [2002] NSWSC 536; and Regina v Scott [2003] NSWSC 627. Trevenna was itself such a case, and since judgment was delivered in Trevenna there have been at least two other sentences in this category: Regina v Vuni [2005] NSWSC 184 and Regina v Ahmad [2005] NSWSC 911. In Cioban the sentence imposed at first instance was a sentence of eight years with a non parole period of five years. That was reduced on appeal to a head sentence of six and a half years with a non parole period of four years. The sentence imposed in Nguyen was a sentence of seven years with a non parole period of three and a half years. The sentence imposed in Scott was a head sentence of five years with a non parole period of two and a half years. The sentence imposed in Trevenna was a head sentence of seven years six months, with a non parole period of four years six months. The sentence imposed in Vuni was a head sentence of ten years with a non parole period of seven years six months. The sentence imposed in Ahmad was nine years four months, with a non parole period of six years. In the cases abovementioned, other than Cioban and Vuni, the offenders had pleaded guilty and this would have influenced the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    37 The number of sentences above reviewed are too few to establish a tariff. That was a view expressed by Barr J in Trevenna (at 532 [107]), and it is a view that I currently hold. Moreover, it remains of significance that each case depends upon its own facts and circumstances. Here, what attracted the offender to the deceased was an intention to rob him, and the offender approached his victim armed with a knife. 
     
      
    38 Having regard to the date of the commission of this crime, the now repealed s 44 applies. Having reflected upon the particular facts and circumstances of this case, I have concluded that but for the plea an appropriate sentence would have been one of nine years imprisonment by way of head sentence. Allowing the discount for the plea, I arrive at a sentence of seven years eight months. I intend to set a non parole period of five years eight months. 
     
      
    39 It is agreed that the offender is to be given credit for the time already spent in custody exclusively in relation to this offence. Calculated to 7 October 2005, that period is two years 162 days. I intend to backdate the sentence in order to give the required credit. 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, I pass sentence as follows: I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of seven years eight months, commencing 28 April 2003 and to expire on 27 December 2010. I set a non parole period of five years eight months. I specify 27 December 2008 as the first date upon which the offender will be eligible for release on parole.

12228,2765199,"R v Alkanaan, R v Toleafoa [2014] NSWSC 1479","Judgment

 

1On 4 April 2014, Mr Falah Alkanaan was arraigned on an Indictment which contained three counts to each of which he pleaded not guilty.

 

2His co-accused, Mr Ben Toleafoa, was also arraigned on the same day with respect to one count (Count 2) on the same Indictment. He also pleaded not guilty.

 

3On 2 May 2014, the trial of the charges was fixed to take place on 16 February 2015, for an estimated period of five weeks.

 

4On 25 July 2014, Mr Alkanaan filed a Notice of Motion in which he sought an order pursuant to s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 severing Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, and an order that Counts 3 and 4 be tried separately from the other counts.

 

5Mr Toleafoa did not join in that application, and made no submission with respect to it.

 

6For the reasons which follow, the application should be dismissed.

 

The Indictment

 

7The Indictment charges Mr Alkanaan with three offences. They are:

 

(1)On 2 February 2013, at Blackett in the State of New South Wales, did murder Hussein Khanafer.

 

(2)[Charge against Ben Toleafoa].

 

(3)Between 8 February 2013 and 7 March 2013, at Silverwater and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Peta Dawson and Arna-Maree McMiles to induce a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceedings, namely Kelly Khanafer, to withhold true evidence.

 

(4)Between 8 February 2013 and 7 March 2013, at Silverwater and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Peta Dawson and Arna-Maree McMiles to induce a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceedings, namely Joshua Nuualiitia, to give false evidence.

 

Crown Case Statement

 

8At the time the applicant was arraigned, the Crown filed a Crown Case Statement. It was to the following effect:

 

""1 The victim, Hussein Khanafer (""Khanafer""), and the accused, Falah Alkanaan, were well known to each other. Khanafer was attempting to obtain money from Alkanaan. On 2 February, 2013, Khanafer sent a text message to Alkanaan in which he said, ""Good morning, cuz. I need my today $4500"".

2 At about 12.30pm on 2 February, 2013, Khanafer drove with his wife Kelly Khanafer, to Alkanaan's home at 20 Boldrewood Road, Blackett, in their white Nissan Tiida car. They parked in the street in front of this address. Whist Kelly Khanafer remained in the car, Khanafer walked to Alkanaan's front door. He and Khanafer had a conversation on the front verandah.

3 Alkanaan's vehicle, a bronze coloured Jeep, was parked in his driveway, and at one point during this meeting Alkanaan stood close by this vehicle.

4. At 12.41pm a call was made from a mobile phone belonging to Alkanaan to a mobile phone used by co-accused, Ben Toleafoa.

5 At about 1.10pm, Khanafer walked back to the street as a silver Ford Falcon BS-72-NS driven by Toleafoa arrived and parked behind Khanafer's car. Khanafer approached this vehicle and spoke through the driver's window with Toleafoa.

6 At this moment, Alkanaan walked from his front yard with a shotgun. From a distance of about one metre he shot Khanafer once in the head as Khanafer was standing by Toleafoa's vehicle. Khanafer fell to the roadway.

7. Kelly Khanafer was still sitting in Khanafer's car. She ran to Khanafer and tried to help him as she called out for assistance.

8 Alkanaan got into the silver Falcon, which was driven from the scene at speed by Toleafoa, leaving Boldrewood Road in the direction of Carlisle Avenue. The vehicle stopped over a small causeway in Carlisle Avenue. The front seat passenger (Alkanaan) got out, carrying an object. He squatted near a drain.

9 Police who were at the scene a short time later searched this drain, finding in it a double-barrelled 12 gauge shotgun and a spent 12 gauge shotgun cartridge.

10. Ambulance and medical personnel attended the scene. Attempts to revive Khanafer were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead a short time later. 

11. On 8 February, 2013, Alkanaan was arrested at Domestic Terminal, Sydney Airport, where he was attempting to board a flight to Darwin, posing as Joshua Nuualiitia. He was carrying identification documents belonging to Joshua Nuualiitia, and wearing plain glass spectacles as a disguise.

12. Alkanaan was interviewed by police. He told police he had been inside his home after speaking outside with Khanafer, when he had heard a shot and had run to the front door. He had seen a silver Ford Falcon behind the white Nissan car and had seen Khanafer fall to the roadway. He had then heard a second shot, at which point he had run through the house and away through the backyard as he believed that he himself was in danger. He declined to name the person or persons in the silver Falcon, giving as his reason that he feared reprisals if he did so.

13. Forensic examination of the shotgun and cartridge retrieved from the drain indicated the presence of the DNA of both Alkanaan and Khanafer on the shotgun; and that of Alkanaan on the cartridge.

14. Telephone calls were intercepted in the period between the shooting and the arrest of Alkanaan. On 7 February 2013 in an intercepted call with his girlfriend, Arna-Maree McMiles, the accused said, ""I've still got it if anybody asks... the one the coppers got, it's not mine...I got it okay...it's silver and wood and yeah. The name of it - double barrel shotgun... Remember, I only took two from you...the bullets, the bullets"".

15. On 13 March 2013 police searched the accused's Jeep. Secreted behind the glove box were two 12 gauge shotgun shells.

16. In a telephone conversation with McMiles on 8 February, Alkanaan was told by McMiles that she had found a white t-shirt that ""needed to be soaked as it had black stuff on it"". He asked her, ""Is there brains on the t-shirt or not?"".

17. In a telephone conversation from gaol on 1 March 2013 with Peta Dawson, the mother of McMiles, the accused said, ""Fuck my mate, tell him I killed him and I'm gonna kill him as well..."". In another such call on the same day, Alkanaan told McMiles that, ""Ben is my man honestly ... he didn't say nothing did he?"".

...

20. Text messages passed between mobile phones used by Alkanaan and Toleafoa in the 24 hour period before the shooting. 29 minutes before the shooting Toleafoa received a 23 second telephone call from Alkanaan.

21. On 28 May 2013 a conversation of Toleafoa, his girlfriend and her sister was recorded on a listening device. Toleafoa said, ""I was there but I didn't get out of the car...I was talking to the guy, I was like 'don't worry about it, man...everything will be fixed'...and that's when he walked out. I didn't know why he was walking out...he just goes, 'aw, you don't have the balls'. He said, 'yes, I do'...then he straight... he fired the first shot... I turned back and he jumped in the car... and then I went like up three houses and I said 'jump out' and he jumped out and he went down to the alley way"".

22. ...

23. Following the arrest of Alkanaan, his telephone calls from prison were monitored. A surveillance (listening) device was also employed by police to monitor visits he received in prison from his partner, Arna-Maree McMiles, and her mother, Peta Dawson.""

 

9Together with the submissions which were filed on the hearing of the Motion, the Crown also filed a Statement of Facts which outlined, in greater detail, the events upon which the Crown relies with respect to Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, namely the two conspiracy counts.

 

10It is apparent that the Crown alleges that on 21 February 2013, at about 10.20am, the applicant, Mr Alkanaan, and his two co-accused, McMiles, and Dawson, met at the Silverwater Jail. This meeting was intercepted using a lawfully obtained listening device. During that meeting an agreement was formed between the three parties to conspire to induce witnesses to withhold true evidence and to give false evidence.

 

11The Crown's case is that this conspiracy had two parts. The first agreement was to put pressure on Kelly Khanafer to withdraw or change her evidence in relation to seeing Alkanaan shooting the deceased, Hussein Khanafer. The second agreement alleged by the Crown was to fabricate evidence surrounding how Alkanaan took possession of Joshua Nuualiitia's identification. The evidence with respect to each of these counts consists largely, but not entirely, of recordings of conversations between all of the conspirators, and observations of the nature of the two co-conspirators.

 

12These conversations happened a number of times and on different days. The substance of the first agreement was that Mr Alkanaan's two co-conspirators would make contact with a mutual associate, Mr Paul Demarco, and they would persuade him to speak to Kelly Khanafer and get her to alter her evidence. With respect to the second agreement, the Crown's case in summary is that an agreement was made to speak with Nuualiitia to tell him to tell the police that he had lost his wallet at McDonald's in St Marys, and to hide the true circumstances of how Alkanaan came into possession of the wallet.

 

Submissions of the Applicant

 

13The applicant's submissions were contained in writing and were also delivered orally. In submissions, the applicant commenced by acknowledging, and accepting, that the evidence which would be led by the Crown in support of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, would be relevant and admissible in a trial of the count of murder on the Indictment.

 

14When asked to describe the issues in the trial, in the sense of the basis of his present understanding of what those issues were likely to be, counsel for the applicant indicated that there were two, both of which were directed to the issue of the requisite mental element for the commission of the offence.

 

15Counsel submitted that, subject to the receipt of further evidence, it was the applicant's present intention to raise a question of diminished responsibility. As well he indicated, again subject to the receipt of further expert evidence, that it was likely that the applicant would raise the issue of accident, namely, that the shotgun was discharged, unintentionally and by accident, with the consequence that the applicant would not be guilty of the murder of Mr Khanaafer.

 

16The applicant submitted that the addition on the Indictment of the two conspiracy counts to the count of murder ""... overloads and complicates the Indictment"". He submitted that the charge of murder was utterly disparate from the charges of conspiracy, and that the Indictment was overloaded, thereby:

 

""... potentially creating oppression, unfairness, confusion in the minds of the jury and an unmanageable trial"".

 

17In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant put that the inclusion of the additional conspiracy charges on the Indictment ""... removed the focus"" from the principal count on the Indictment, being the charge of murder.

 

18He also submitted that inclusion of the three counts would lead to the accused being embarrassed in his defence. In support of this submission, attention was drawn to the complexity of directions which would need to given by the trial Judge to the jury with respect to the two conspiracy charges which, it was submitted, added to the complexity of the overall trial.

 

19In support of this submission, the applicant pointed to the fact that the two co-conspirators with respect to the conspiracy charges were not charged jointly with the applicant on the indictment before the Court, but rather that the Crown was proceeding separately against them in the District Court.

 

20In summary, counsel for the applicant encapsulated the essence of the basis for the application when he made this submission orally:

 

""I concede that the evidence post conduct in relation to the accused is relevant to the mental element of the offence and that evidence will end up before the jury. I can't see how I can stop it. So we will have the evidence but why do we need to have the added complication of the legal elements in relation to conspiracy to clutter, effectively, what should be the focus of the trial namely the criminal responsibility of the accused in relation to Count 1.""

 

Submissions of the Crown

 

21The Crown opposed the application of Mr Alkanaan, and submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated to the Court that it should form the opinion required by s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, before the Court would order separate trials of the counts on the Indictment.

 

22The Crown submitted that the evidence which it would lead in support of the proof of the conspiracy counts was relevant to, and admissible in, the Crown's case on the murder count. It submitted that such evidence had a high probative value for the jury in the determination of the murder charge. It submitted that the addition of the need for the Court to give directions to the jury with respect to the separate conspiracy charges would not result in any significant additional extension of the trial, nor of any significant complexity for the jury.

 

23The Crown accepted that in order for the applicant to be convicted of the conspiracy counts the jury would have to be directed that they needed to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of the existence of the conspiracy to induce the witnesses to give false evidence or withhold true evidence. The Crown submitted that in that respect, it would be appropriate for the Court to give a direction to the jury to a similar effect before the jury was permitted to take the evidence supporting Counts 3 and 4 into account as consciousness of guilt evidence with respect to Count 1.

 

24The Crown submitted that this would in fact place a higher burden on the Crown, and would be beneficial for, rather than adverse to, the interests of the applicant.

 

25The Crown also submitted that it would be necessary for the Court to consider the public interest in not having the applicant tried separately with respect to the conspiracy counts because having a single trial would mean that the evidence would not need to be called twice. In that respect the Crown pointed out that in addition to the recordings of the various conversations which will form one of the bases of the Crown's case, there were a number of other potential police witnesses, and at least one lay witness, who it is intended will give oral evidence about the conduct of the two co-accused, in furtherance of the conspiracy.

 

26The Crown pointed to the undesirability, in the public interest, of putting those witnesses through a second trial, and the unnecessary cost and expense to the administration of justice of such a separate trial.

 

27The Crown pointed out that, in the context of those witnesses, they were also expected to give evidence at a trial in the District Court with respect to the two co-conspirators, and ultimately if the Court did sever the counts from the Indictment, those witnesses would be giving evidence three times with respect to these events.

 

28Shortly put, the Crown submitted that the counts on the Indictment fell within the statement of principle contained in R v Assim [1966] 2 QB 249, which the Crown submitted was approved in McCarthy v Regina (1984) 14 A Crim R 155 at 159, namely:

 

""Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in the one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together.""

 

29The Crown submitted that the application did not meet the requisite test in s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act because the applicant could not demonstrate how he would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence, and further submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated that there was any other reason why it was desirable to have the charges tried separately.

 

30The Crown drew attention to the statement of principle in R v Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441 at 443 that:

 

""... The most straightforward case in which separate trials will not be ordered is whether the evidence admissible on the trial of one charge is in any event admissible on the trial of the other, by way (for example) of similar facts"".

 

31It submitted that this case was substantially the same as Verma, and was typically the very type of case where the Court would not order a separate trial of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment. 

 

Applicable Legislation

 

32Section 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act is the applicable legislation. It says:

 

""(2) If of the opinion:

 

(a)that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

 

(b)that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

 

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.""

 

33Both parties accept that the applications are made in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. It is appropriate that I set out the relevant parts.

 

34Part 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with indictments. Section 21 deals with a question of a separate trial. It is in the following terms:

 

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 

 

(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case. 

(2) If of the opinion: 

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 

(3) If of the opinion that the postponement of an accused person's trial is expedient as a consequence of it having amended an indictment or ordered a separate trial of a count, the court may make such order as appears necessary. 

(4) An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial. 

(5) The following provisions apply if an order is made under this section for a separate trial or for the postponement of a trial: 

(a) if the order is made during the trial, the court may order that the jury be discharged from giving a verdict: 

(i) on the count or counts in respect of which the trial is postponed, or 

(ii) on the indictment, 

as the case may be, 

(b) the procedure on the separate trial of a count, and the procedure on the postponed trial, are to be the same in all respects (if the jury has been discharged) as if the trial had not commenced, 

(c) subject to the Bail Act 2013 , the court may commit the accused person to a correctional centre. 

(6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.""

 

35Section 21(4) provides that an order under s 21(2) may be made before a trial or at any stage during the trial.

 

36Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with criminal proceedings generally, and includes s 29 which addresses the hearing of multiple offences. Section 29 is in the following form:

 

""29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time 

 

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 

(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent, 

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 

(2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances: 

(a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent, 

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 

(3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.""

 

Principles of Law

 

37The Crown submissions, and the application by the applicants' counsel that the evidence relevant to Counts 3 and 4 would be admitted with respect to the offences of murder in Count 1, correctly reflected the authorities.

 

38In McKey v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 1, Latham J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) said at [26] this:

 

""26 The law has always recognized the legitimacy of reliance upon post-offence conduct in support of a prosecution case. The most common example of such post-offence conduct is lies told by an accused (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193), although an accused's silence in response to an allegation which he/she might reasonably be expected to deny (R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226), the destruction of evidence ( R v Nguyen [2001] VSCA 1) and attempts to influence the evidence of witnesses ( R v Smit & Ors . [2004] NSWCCA 409) all fall into the same category. Similarly, 

 

'Flight from justice, and its analogous conduct, have always been deemed indicative of a consciousness of guilt. ...... It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused's flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself :.. '

 

Wigmore on Evidence, Vol 2, (1979) par 276(4)""

 

39In Kuehne v R [2012] NSWCCA 270, Fullerton J, after referring to the decision in McKey, said at [68] this:

 

""68 Her Honour did observe that where the Crown intends to rely upon an accused's post offence conduct as evidencing consciousness of guilt, the evidence must be capable of rationally supporting an inference of guilt of the crime charged before it is admitted for that purpose and, as part of that enquiry, the conduct must be identified by the Crown with precision and its capacity to constitute an implied admission of the offence charged made patent.""

 

40Applying those principles, it is clear that the evidence of the post-murder conduct of the applicant would be admissible and may be persuasive in the jury's mind. Caution does not dictate that there is any reason here to think that the counts ought be tried separately on this basis.

 

41In McCarthy v Regina (1984) 14 A Crim R 155, Street CJ (with whom Reynolds and Miles JJ) agreed, said at p159 - 160:

 

""The test to be applied when examining whether or not the interests of justice are such as to permit the joinder of two counts was expressed in a decision of Assim ([1966] 2 QB 249) in terms that have been commended on a number of subsequent occasions in decisions of authority, both in this country and in England. At 261 in the judgment of that case it was said:

 

""As a general rule it is, of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that have nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together. Such a rule, of course, includes cases where there is evidence that several offenders acted in concert but is not limited to such cases."" ""

 

42It is clear that if the two preconditions to the exercise of the Court's power to order separate trials of counts on an indictment are established, the Court maintains a discretion which it is required to exercise showing regard to the interests of justice.

 

43In Samadi and Djait v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 330; (2008) 192 A Crim R 251, Beazley JA (with whom Allsop and Price JJ agreed), said at [108]:

 

""108 The question of whether there should be joint or separate trials is a matter for discretion for the judge at the trial: see R v Grondkowski; R v Malinowski [1946] 1 KB 369; [1946] 1 All ER 559; Merritt v Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364. The discretion must be exercised judicially and not capriciously, having regard to the interests of justice as well as the interests of the accused: see Slattery CJ in CL and Carruthers J at 364.""

 

44Latham J (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J) in R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50, adopted this approach at [21] and noted that the interests of justice are not solely referrable to the interests of an accused.

 

Discernment

 

45The first question which must be determined is whether I am satisfied that the applicant may be embarrassed or prejudiced in his defence by reason of all three counts remaining on the Indictment.

 

46Because of the properly made concession that the evidence with respect to the conspiracy counts was admissible on the murder count, any question of embarrassment or prejudice must be limited to some feature of the proposed trial over and above the evidence relevant to the conspiracy charges being put before the jury.

 

47The only additional element pointed to is the trial Judge's directions about, and the jury's consideration of, the guilt or innocence of the applicant on the conspiracy counts.

 

48I am wholly unpersuaded that these additional burdens, if such they be, are of a sufficient extent to cause any prejudice or embarrassment to the applicant in his defence of the proceedings. The directions about the conspiracy charge are not particularly complex, a written outline of the element of the offences are likely to be provided to the jury and the jury will be instructed to consider separately with respect to each count, whether the evidence led satisfies them beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant. I do not accept that having the jury undertake such consideration will distract its focus from making its determination in the murder count.

 

49There is no other reason advanced which satisfies me that it is desirable that the charges be heard separately. The two issues announced by counsel for the applicant as likely to arise do not suggest that there ought be separate trials.

 

50As well, the interests of the administration of justice strongly favour the three counts being heard together so as to avoid the evidence to the extent that it depends upon the witnesses being called to support the existence of the conspiracy charged in Counts 3 and 4, being required to give evidence twice in respect of proceedings against the applicant.

 

51There is good reason why those witnesses should not be required to give their evidence, as being relevant to the applicant, on two separate occasions before two separate juries. Particularly is this so because they will also be required to give their evidence in the trial of the applicant's two co-conspirators which is presently scheduled to take place in the District Court late in 2014.

 

52Accordingly, I am satisfied that the interests of justice tell against making the order sought by the applicant.

 

Order

 

53The Court orders:

 

(1)Application for separate trials of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment presented on 4 April 2014 dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    2 R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    3 DAVIES J: On 30 October 2008 the Applicant Wayne Mack pleaded guilty to the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Cultivate by enhanced indoor means a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, being a quantity of 68 plants for a commercial purpose – s 23(1A)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years or a fine of 3500 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 2: Supply a prohibited drug, namely cannabis oil, in an amount of 183.6 grams – s 25(1)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 3: Unauthorised possession of 7 firearms in circumstances of aggravation – s 51D(2)  
        Firearms Act 
         1996 (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment – standard non-parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
      
    4 In sentencing the Applicant for the offence in count 3 the Judge took into account, at the Applicant’s request, his guilt in respect of 4 further offences listed in a Form 1 document as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Form 1:  
         
          
          (1) Supply a prohibited drug (4717 grams cannabis leaf) – s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
         
          
          (2) Supply a prohibited drug (123.85 grams of cannabis resin) - s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) Unauthorised possession of prohibited weapon (Rhino crossbow) – s 7(1)  
          Weapons Prohibition Act 
           1998 (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment); 
          
         
         
          
          (4) Stealing motor vehicle (quad bike farm vehicle) – s 154F  
          Crimes Act 
           1900 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment). 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 On 27 November 2008, his Honour Acting Judge Woods QC sentenced the Applicant Wayne Mack as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, the sentence being deemed to have commenced on 26 March 2007 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 September 2008; 
         
         
        Count 2, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 26 March 2008 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 March 2010; 
         
         
        Count 3, (taking into account the Form 1) sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 26 September 2009 with the non-parole period expiring on 25 September 2012. 
        
       
      
    6 The Judge sentenced the Applicant Wayne Mack in respect of Court 1 on the mistaken belief, induced by the representative of the Crown, that the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty points or both. That is the penalty for an offence under s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for the cultivation of a prohibited plant. However, the offence charged was, in its terms, an offence under s 23(1A) of the Act which was the offence of cultivating by enhanced indoor means a number of prohibited plants. The penalty under s 23(1A) where the prohibited plants are cannabis is provided for in s 33(2)(b) by virtue of s 33(1)(a). The penalty for an offence under s 23(1)(a) for cannabis is provided for in s 32(1)(h) by virtue of s 32(1)(a). This mistaken belief on the part of the sentencing judge does not affect the outcome of this application for leave to appeal.  
     
      
    7 The Applicant Wayne Mack seeks leave to appeal on 4 grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence imposed upon count 2 was too severe and some other lesser sentence is warranted. 
       
       
      2. The sentence imposed upon count 3 was too severe and some other lesser sentence is warranted. 
       
       
      3. His Honour erred in his assessment and application of Part 4 Div 1A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999 for count 3. 
       
       
      4. His Honour erred in fixing the commencement dates for counts 2 and 3 by failing to have proper regard to the totality of the circumstances of the offences. 
       
      
    8 The Applicant Annette Mack pleaded guilty to two counts on 13 November 2008 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Cultivate by enhanced indoor means a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, being a quantity of 68 plants for a commercial purpose – s 23(1A)(b)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985 (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment or 3500 penalty units or both); 
         
         
        Count 2: Unauthorised possession of 4 firearms in circumstances of aggravation – s 51D(2)  
        Firearms Act 
         1996 (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment – standard non-parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
      
    9 In sentencing the Applicant for the offence in count 2 the Judge took into account, at the Applicant’s request, her guilt in respect of 1 further offence listed in a Form 1 document as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Form 1:  
         
         
          
          (1) Supply a prohibited drug (4717 grams of cannabis leaf) – s 25(1)  
          Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
           1985 (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units or both); 
          
         
        
       
      The 4 firearms were the first 4 of the 7 in respect of which the Applicant Wayne Mack was charged.  
       
      
    10 On 27 November 2008 his Honour Acting Judge Woods QC sentenced the Applicant Annette Mack as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing 27 November 2008 with the non-parole period expiring 26 May 2010; 
         
         
        Count 2, (taking into account Form 1) imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 27 November 2009 with the non-parole period expiring 26 November 2011. 
        
       
      
    11 Again, the Judge sentenced the Applicant Annette Mack in the belief that the maximum penalty for count 1 was 10 years and 2000 penalty units or both. 
     
      
    12 The Applicant Annette Mack seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence imposed upon count 2, possession unlicensed/ unregistered firearms, was too severe and a lesser sentence was warranted. 
       
       
      2. His Honour erred by imposing a custodial sentence. 
       
       
      3. His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
       
       
      4. His Honour erred in his assessment in his application of Part 4 Div 1A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999. 
       
       
      Background to the offences 
       
      
    13 On 26 March 2007 Police executed a search warrant at a property owned by the Applicants at Lot 78 Bunbury Road, Bocoble, a village outside Mudgee. At the premises Police found: 
     
      
       
        A room in which 51 cannabis plants were being grown hydroponically and 17 other cannabis plants; 
       
       
        A quantity of cannabis leaf (4.7 kilograms); 
       
       
        Cannabis oil and resin; 
       
       
        A large number of firearms (including rifles, pistols and other prohibited firearms and ammunition); 
       
       
        A stolen quad bike; 
       
       
        $11,000 in cash together with items associated with the cultivation and sale of cannabis. 
       
      
    14 Lot 78 Bunbury Road, Bocoble is a single storey 3 bedroom house situated on 25 acres near the small village of Bocoble. There were on the property a number of sheds and a number of unregistered car bodies.  
     
      
    15 On the date the search warrant was executed, 26 March 2007, the property was occupied by Annette Mack and her two children, a daughter then aged 16 and a son, then aged 12. At that time, the Applicants were estranged with Wayne Mack being absent from the property for periods of time. On 26 March, however, he was found hiding on the property later that day.  
     
      
    16 The police found a small room attached to one of the spare bedrooms to the premises. Inside this small room was an established hydroponic cannabis plant bed containing 51 small cannabis plants growing separately in individual pots. These plants were irrigated by black hosing and there were two interior lights sources on at the time of the plants being located. The light source was controlled by a timer in the power point. The plant bed area was enclosed by reflective foil. Fourteen cuttings of small cannabis plants were additionally found within the hydroponic area. 
     
      
    17 In one of the cupboards within that room there were dry cuttings of cannabis within plastic bags and around the cupboard. The room had string across the ceiling line and a light within the cupboard to create a drying area.  
     
      
    18 A number of firearms were found in both the room containing the hydroponic setup and an adjoining room.  
     
      
    19 The police searched Wayne Mack’s motor vehicle and found a loaded .357 Magnum calibre shortened revolving rifle. 
     
      
    20 The following day the police executed a further search warrant on a property in Crudane Road, Crudane (near Mudgee) owned by the Applicants. The property is remote rural bushland with the only dwelling on it being a caravan. The caravan contained various quantities of ammunition, 2 rifles and a silencer.  
     
      
    21 In total the police found at the properties and in Wayne Mack’s vehicle 13 unregistered firearms, 5 prohibited firearms and 2 silencers, 1 firearm registered to a deceased person and 4 other registered firearms in a gun cabinet. It is noted, however, that the Applicant Wayne Mack was only charged with possession of 5 firearms and the Applicant Annette Mack was only charged with possession of 3 firearms. Count 3 in relation to the Applicant Wayne Mack and count 2 in relation to the Applicant Annette Mack included references to silencers. However, silencers are neither firearms nor prohibited firearms within the definitions contained in s 4 and Schedule 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    22 Both the Applicants held current shooters licenses.  
     
      
       
      Appeal by Wayne Mack 
       
      
    23 The sentencing judge noted that the Applicant was aged 42 years and had no criminal history. His Honour noted that the Applicant’s father and grandfather had been interested in firearms and that the Applicant had been a member of a gun club in Wollongong where he was born and raised. After he moved to and purchased some land near Mudgee, the Applicant continued his interest in guns and did work in the Mudgee district eradicating feral animals such as pigs. At various times he had a licence for certain firearms. He had some registered firearms and had been an authorised user of firearms for feral animal eradication.  
     
      
    24 The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing but evidence was given by his mother. She gave evidence that one of the silencers found at the property had been made for the Applicant by his grandfather when the Applicant was a teenager to enable him to shoot rabbits without the rabbits hearing the noise of a gun. She gave evidence that he had held a gun licence from his teen years. No explanation was given for the possession of the second silencer.  
     
      
    25 His mother also gave evidence explaining why he carried a loaded revolver in his motor vehicle. She said it was in connection with the trapping of pigs. It was necessary to have a loaded revolver in case one of the pigs attacked the dogs used to assist in the trapping of pigs. She gave evidence that his grandfather, his father and his uncle had all collected guns. 26 His Honour made no findings about the Applicant’s drug use. His mother’s evidence was that she did not know that he or Annette smoked marijuana although, since their arrest, they had told her that they did. 
     
      
    27 It was in the light of that background that his Honour came to sentence the Applicant.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – sentence imposed on count 2 was too severe 
       
      
    28 Count 2 was the offence of supplying a prohibited drug being cannabis oil in the amount of 183.6 grams. The sentence was a total term of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing from 26 March 2008 and expiring on 25 March 2010.  
     
      
    29 His Honour made what must be regarded as non-controversial statements about the cultivation and supply of drugs, the harm to the community from them and the need for sentences that act as a general deterrent.  
     
      
    30 When coming to the particular offences charged, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect to the drug offences the law states ten and fifteen years and it is not a matter of court categorising the type of drugs, the legislation has already done that so I am bound to consider the penalty as stated by the law as the benchmark for the most serious cases and then refer to the statistics to ascertain the appropriate range. 
         
         
        The statistics are limited. For enhanced cultivation the statistics show a range of six months to eighteen months for the non-parole period which does seem very low considering the overall effect of any drugs in our society today. But I am also considering the matters on the Form 1 which in themselves are serious. I will consider a period of eighteen months for the non-parole period for the enhanced cultivation.  
        For the supply which comes under a provision with a higher maximum I would have to consider a period of two years non-parole.  
        This would be arrived at by starting at a term of four years with allowance for the plea of guilty taking it to three years and then an allowance for his no prior involvement with the law meaning I can consider good prospects for rehabilitation in finding a non-parole period of two years.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    31 In fact, as I have pointed out earlier, the maximum penalty in terms of imprisonment for the advanced cultivation was the same as the maximum penalty for supply. But on the basis of what the sentencing judge and the parties believed was the maximum under count 1, the applicant submits, nevertheless, that simply because there was a higher maximum penalty for count 2 did not mean that a higher sentence was required. This was because the offence charged in count 2 was objectively less serious so that a lesser sentence was warranted.  
     
      
    32 In Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 the High Court was dealing with the approach taken by this Court in a Crown appeal against an inadequate sentence for a charge of supplying heroin in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug – 415g. The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 provided for a variety of maximum periods of imprisonment depending on the quantity of the drug involved. In relation to heroin, where the quantity is less than 250g and the matter is dealt with on indictment the maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment. Where the quantity is not less than 250g but less than 1000g it is 20 years imprisonment and where the quantity is not less than 1000g it is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    33 In the course of re-sentencing the offender, Hulme J (with whom Heydon JA and Carruthers A-J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Had the [appellant's] offence and circumstances fallen within the category of a worst case falling within the statutory provisions, the sentence should have been not less than the 15 years maximum for the offence of supplying an indictable quantity. I appreciate that the charge specified a commercial quantity, that the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for that offence is 20 years and that the quantity involved in this offence was only a little more than 40 per cent of the maximum commercial quantity.  
        However, Parliament cannot have intended that, other things being equal, the penalty for supplying more than 250 g should be less than for supplying that quantity. 
        ” (emphasis added) 
         
         
        
       
      
    34 Of the highlighted statement the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] …The form of the statement is explained by the fact that his Honour did not start with the maximum penalty for an offence involving the quantity in question, but used another maximum penalty as his starting point, that is, the maximum for an offence in the category of seriousness immediately below that of the principal offence.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        [33] A serious fallacy in his Honour's reasoning is that it assumes that any case involving more than 250g of heroin is likely to be a worse case than any case involving only 250g or less. That cannot be so in the virtually absolute terms in which his Honour puts it. … Having started with a penalty which would have been appropriate for the worst possible kind of offence of supply involving up to 250 grams of heroin, Hulme J made no attempt to identify the nature of such a case and to make a comparison of the facts of the principal offence with it.” 
        
       
      
    35 What the sentencing judge said in the passage I have highlighted in para 30 above was ambiguous. His Honour could simply have been noting the higher maximum penalty in respect of count 2 without reasoning, as was contended by the Applicant, that for that reason alone he had to impose a higher penalty. However, one matter supporting the Applicant’s contention is that the sentencing judge did not discuss anything in particular relating to the objective seriousness of each of the offences of cultivation and supply to enable a proper comparison between them.  
     
      
    36 Nevertheless, if the sentencing judge made an error in this regard his error in relation to the maximum penalty on count 1 worked in the applicant’s favour. I do not consider that either the non-parole period, nor the term of imprisonment ordered in relation to count 2 was outside the appropriate range of discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – sentence on count 3 too severe 
       
       
      Ground 3 – error in applying Part 4 Div 1A of the Act 
       
      
    37 His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 26 September 2009 and expiring 25 September 2012.  
     
      
    38 His Honour drew attention to the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years and said that they highlighted how seriously the legislature and the community saw the unauthorised possession of firearms. His Honour went on, correctly, to refer to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 to note the correct approach in relation to sentencing where there is a standard non-parole period. In this regard his Honour said that the standard non-parole period can be seen as a reference point for a mid-range case “although not necessarily the starting point”. 
     
      
    39 However, what his Honour did not do was to follow the approach to sentencing required by Part 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and as explained in Way, R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [32] – [34] and MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [28] – [38]. In particular, his Honour did not determine in the first instance the level of objective seriousness of the offence, although it can probably be inferred that his Honour took the view that it was to be assessed at less than the middle of the range of objective seriousness because his Honour said he would start at eight years non-parole before reducing it for particular matters.  
     
      
    40 His Honour did not, as he should have done, identify the matters which go to determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Simpson J in AJP at [13](iv) identified the factors and matters in general terms that ought to be examined. Applying those to the facts in the present matter suggests that the following would be the relevant considerations: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the number of the firearms; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the number of the firearms that were prohibited or were pistols; 
        
       
       
       (c) the nature and type of the firearms; 
       
       
       (d) the purpose for the possession of the firearms; 
       
       
        
        (e) evidence which would show any relationship between the possession of the firearms and the drug industry being carried on at the premises; and 
        
       
       
        
        (f) the location of the property and the security under which the firearms were kept. 
        
       
      
    41 The evidence about these matters can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         There were 5 prohibited firearms; 
        
       
       
        
         For the offence in s 51D(2) to be committed it is sufficient only that there be 1 prohibited firearm with the remaining firearms referred to in the sub-section being unregistered; 
        
       
       
        
         3 of the weapons consisted of a revolver and 2 shortened rifles all of which are firearms that could be concealed; 
        
       
       
        
         The Applicant was in possession of 2 silencers, one at least of which appeared to have been a homemade silencer made by his grandfather for the purpose of shooting rabbits quietly; 
        
       
       
        
         The Applicant had long had an interest in guns, had been a member of a pistol club and had held a shooter’s licence for a number of years; 
        
       
       
        
         At least some of the firearms were used for legitimate purposes of controlling and killing feral animals; 
        
       
       
        
         There was no evidence of any criminal purpose for the possession of the firearms nor that they were used in any way connected with the drug business being conducted; 
        
       
       
        
         The finding by his Honour that there was no history of aggressive behaviour on the part of the Applicant. 
        
       
       
        
         The fact that a drug business was being conducted from the premises where the firearms were kept might be thought to increase the risk of a break-in and theft of the weapons. 
        
       
       
        
         The firearms were located on rural properties and were not properly stored; 
        
       
      
    42 In my view, the balancing of these matters points to the fact that the objective seriousness of the offence was on the lower side of the middle range of seriousness with the result that it was within his Honour’s discretion to take a starting point of eight years before the other deductions were made.  
     
      
    43 His Honour’s approach was to reduce the 8 year period to 6 for the plea of guilty (a 25 per cent reduction) and then to reduce the non-parole period to 3 years for what his Honour said was the Applicant’s clean record and the principle of totality. That was a substantial reduction but the Applicant claims that the sentencing judge, having found that the offence was less than the middle range of objective seriousness should not have allowed the standard non-parole period to have dominated the remainder of the sentencing exercise.  
     
      
    44 Although it is true that a non-parole period of 3 years for the offence is quite a bit higher than the statistics show had been given (88 per cent given 2 years or less) the statistics were those for offences to which a standard non-parole period did not apply. The standard non-parole period for an offence against s 51D(2) came into force on 1 January 2008. It applied to offences whenever committed except in the case of an offender who had, by that date, been convicted or had entered a plea of guilty which had not been withdrawn. In any event, care must be taken in the use of statistics in sentencing; Way at [140] and Graham v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [35]-[37].  
     
      
    45 It does not seem to me that his Honour did allow the standard non-parole period to dominate the remainder of the sentencing exercise. It is made clear in both Way and AJP that the standard non-parole period remains of relevance as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost even if there are reasons for departing from it. It does not seem to me that the non-parole period set was outside the range of appropriate discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – error in the commencement dates for counts 2 and 3, and totality 
       
      
    46 The effect of the sentences was that the Applicant received an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8½ years and an aggregate non-parole period of 5½ years. The Applicant says that for the 3 offences charged this was neither just nor appropriate and a lesser degree of accumulation was required. 
     
      
    47 His Honour said in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the matter of totality for the number of separate offences I would recognise the conjunction of the two drug offences and allow some concurrency there and then in relation to the firearms offences also allowing for some concurrency and at the end there would still be a suitable period of parole to allow for the effect of any accumulation. “ 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour accumulated count 2 by 12 months and accumulated count 3 by a further 18 months. The Applicant says that the 2 drug offences should have been accumulated only by 6 months and the firearms offence accumulated by another 6 months. This would have the effect that his non-parole period would expire on 25 March 2011.  
     
      
    49 In Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1 Howie J (with whom Price and Adams JJ agreed on this aspect of the judgment) said at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [T]here is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.” 
        
       
      
    50 Similarly, in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[11] …It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence…” 
        
       
      
    51 Although the sentencing judge made reference to the matter of totality for the offences there is no indication that he approached the matter in the manner discussed in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63, R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 and subsequently in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18]-[27]. When the principle of totality is viewed, the overall criminality of the offences did not justify a sentence of imprisonment of 8½ years and a non-parole period of 5½ years and was outside the appropriate range of discretion for the reasons that follow. 
     
      
    52 There was a close connection between the first two counts being the cultivation of the cannabis plants and the supply of cannabis oil. Indeed, given the size of the cultivation and the amounts of cash found, the main purpose of it must have been for the supply of the prohibited drug in one form or another. In making the sentences for those offences concurrent only to the extent that the sentencing judge did means that the sentence was excessive in terms of the overall criminality of the drug business being conducted by the Applicant. Compared with a number of cultivations that have come before the courts, this was a relatively small operation, and part of its reason was no doubt connected with the use of the marijuana by the Applicants. In terms of the overall criminality for the drug offences his Honour appropriately sentenced the Applicant to a longer period for count 2. But to accumulate that sentence by 12 months was outside the proper range of discretionary judgment bearing in mind the connection between the 2 offences and the longer sentence given for count 2. 
     
      
    53 Although his Honour did not find that the purpose of the possession of the firearms was related to the drug business being conducted his Honour saw it as a relevant factor that the unauthorised firearms were held by a person who was also involved in the cultivation of prohibited drugs. Further, his Honour referred to the policy of the legislature to ensure that there is no unauthorised and unnecessary proliferation of firearms. The fact that a drug cultivation business was being conducted from the premises increases the risk of the proliferation of those weapons because of the increased risk of a break-in.  
     
      
    54 In all the circumstances, a proper application of the principle of totality would have resulted in an overall sentence of 7½ years with an aggregate non-parole period of 4½ years. His Honour ought to have directed that sentences in respect of counts 1 and 2 should have been served concurrently. The result would have been, therefore, that the Applicant’s non-parole period in respect of count 2 would have expired on 25 March 2009. His Honour was not in error in accumulating the sentence for count 3 in the way he did. However, the correction to the accumulation that ought to be made in relation to the sentence for count 2 has the result that the overall sentence is reduced to 7½ years with an aggregate non-parole period of 4½ years expiring on 25 September 2011.  
     
      
      Appeal by Annette Mack 
       
      
    55 There was evidence given by Mrs Beverley Mack at the sentencing hearing to the effect that the Applicant Annette Mack was the submissive one in the marriage. The evidence was that Wayne Mack made the decisions in the family and that Annette was not a confident person and she would go along with what Wayne would suggest and was easily led.  
     
      
    56 Mrs Beverley Mack said that she had some concern as to Annette Mack’s level of intellectual function. That view receives support from the report of Mr Alex Edgar, forensic psychologist, whose testing placed Annette Mack at the top end of the Borderline range with her skills being superior to 8% of the population.  
     
      
    57 Mrs Beverley Mack’s evidence about her daughter-in-law’s submissiveness is also borne out by what Mr Edgar said in his report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The Applicant’s] responses indicated she wants to be accepted and involved with others but is hesitant due to her fear of being rejected or humiliated by them. She likely experiences feelings of unease and anxiety and perceives herself to be socially inept and inadequate, consequently she likely undervalues her achievements and engages in self-criticism, frequently feeling alone and isolated. Her test results suggest she restricts her social environment more so since her involvement in the offences and this compounds her depressive symptomatology.” 
        
       
      
    58 Although the sentencing judge referred to the report of Mr Edgar he made no reference to his assessment of the Applicant in terms of the psychometric and personality testing conducted by him. His Honour, however, touched on this issue when he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted to me that she was only the partner of her husband in this matter [i.e. the propagation of drugs] and of course I have already dealt with her husband and that in fact it was his operation and she was in the position of a wife who had to go along. However she herself was a user of cannabis and therefore must be taken to have known exactly what was happening …” 
        
       
       
      His Honour appeared only to relate the matters raised by Mrs Beverley Mack and Mr Edgar to the drug charge.  
       
      
    59 Further information concerning the Applicant’s personal circumstances, noted by the sentencing judge, was that she was aged 45 and had no criminal history. She left home at age 20 after meeting her husband and had no contact with her own family who had largely ignored her. She left school in year 9 without any formal academic qualifications. She had been a cannabis user since 18 years of age although she had ceased using it for about 10 years after the birth of her children.  
     
      
    60 I turn now to consider the grounds of appeal which can be conveniently be dealt with as a whole since they only concern count 2 and the approach to the sentencing on that ground.  
     
      
    61 The Applicant points to two alleged errors on the part of the sentencing judge. First, it is said that his Honour aggravated the objective seriousness of the offence because he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]here is no evidence as to efforts made by either parent to teach the children about the proper care and security in use of firearms.” 
        
       
       
      That his Honour thought this issue was important can be seen from his return to the same point where he said: 
       
       
        
        “There is no evidence of how the parents were teaching the children and the levels of responsibility and care required by our society in the propagation and use of drugs and the care and security of firearms.” 
        
       
       
      In fact, this was an entirely irrelevant consideration, even if there had been evidence that the parents had not taught their children about the matters his Honour mentioned. It must be inferred that his Honour took this irrelevant consideration into account against the Applicant by reason of the fact that he mentioned it on 2 occasions.  
       
      
    62 Secondly, it is said that his Honour was in error in linking the possession of the firearms with the cultivation of the drugs as the reason for considering a custodial sentence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the offender before me for the count on the indictment I must consider a custodial term to take account of the number of firearms involved together with the conjunction of the cultivation of prohibited drugs.” 
        
       
       
      In truth, there was no evidence linking the two things and the evidence that was given pointed the other way because the guns were said to belong to Wayne Mack and had been collected over a long period of time because of his interest in guns and his use of at least some of them for the purpose of the control of feral animals.  
       
      
    63 The important finding his Honour did make in relation to this Applicant and the guns was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “However I do feel that her possession of the firearms was in a way a flow on from the activities of her husband and that she may not be as positively involved.” 
        
       
      
    64 His Honour then went on to say that even though there was a standard non-parole period of ten years for a mid-range case, he found that her involvement would be below the mid-range of seriousness and would start at 5 years. He then reduced that to 3 years and 3 months for the plea of guilty and again reduced it to a non-parole period of 2 years because of her prior history of no involvement with the law. 
     
      
    65 It seems to me that in coming to a view about the objective seriousness of the offence his Honour ought to have considered the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the evidence pointed strongly to the fact that the firearms belonged to the Applicant’s husband Wayne and her liability in relation to the offence arose only from the joint ownership and occupation of the premises; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the offence was at the lower end of the range when the number of firearms is considered, particularly given that the silencer should not have been included as a prohibited firearm; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) there was no evidence that the firearms were connected in any way to the drug business; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) there was a finding by his Honour in the remarks on sentence for both this Applicant and the husband that there was no history of aggressive behaviour on the part of either of them that might be relevant to the possession of the weapons. 
        
       
      
    66 If these matters had been properly considered, his Honour ought to have assessed the objective seriousness of the offence at the lower end of the range. His Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was an error. In these circumstances, since I have formed the view that some other sentence should have been passed (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912) I believe there is a need to re-sentence.  
     
      
    67 The offence in count 2 is, generally speaking, one of considerable gravity having regard to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period that have been prescribed by Parliament: see, for example, R v Oliver (1982) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. The Applicant has contended that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a full-time custodial sentence for this offence. Despite my view that the objective seriousness is in the lower range, the need for denunciation and general deterrence dictates that no sentence other than one of full-time imprisonment should have been imposed. In my opinion, and having particularly in mind the matters in para 65 above, the appropriate sentence on count 2 is a sentence of 12 months with 9 months non-parole. Thereafter, the appropriate approach to the totality principle is to sentence the Applicant in respect of count 2 and to accumulate that sentence upon the sentence for the drugs offence by 6 months. The total effective sentence will thereby be one of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
    68 The records of the Department of Corrective Services disclose that the Applicant was held in custody from 27 March to 4 April 2007 when she was released on bail. This was not drawn to his Honour’s attention. In the circumstances, the sentence for the first offence should have been backdated by 9 days to 18 November 2008.  
     
      
       
      Proposed orders re Wayne Mack 
       
      
    69 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Uphold the appeal. 
       
       
      (3) Confirm the sentence for count 1. 
       
       
      (4) In relation to count 2, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 26 March 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 25 March 2009. 
       
       
      (5) In relation to count 3, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 25 September 2008. The Applicant will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 25 September 2011. The total term will expire on 25 September 2014. 
       
       
      Proposed orders re Annette Mack 
       
      
    70 In my opinion the following Orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
       (2) Uphold the appeal. 
       
       
        
        (3) In relation to count 2, quash the sentence and in lieu thereof the Applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 months. The sentence to commence on 18 November 2008 with the non-parole period expiring on 17 August 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In relation to count 1, confirm the term of the sentence including the non-parole period but order that the sentence commence on 18 May 2009. Direct the release of the Applicant on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period expiring on 17 November 2010. The total term will expire on 17 May 2012.

Her Majesty The
Queen (Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

Frederick John
Osborn (Defendant) Respondent.

1969: June 19, 20; 1970: October 6.

Present: Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie,

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trials—Abuse of
process—Oppression—Charge of possession of cheques adapted and intended to be
used to commit forgery—Acquittal—Subsequent charge of conspiring to utter same
cheques—Plea of “autrefois acquit” disallowed—Discretion to stay second
indictment.

The respondent was indicted on a charge of
having had in his possession seven cheques and other papers that were adapted
and intended to be used to commit forgery. In September 1966, he was acquitted
on a directed verdict. The basis for the directed verdict was that the
forgeries were complete so that the cheques could not be held to be adapted or
intended to be used to commit forgery. An appeal by the Crown was dismissed. In
May 1967, the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring with a person
or persons unknown to commit the indictable offence of uttering the same seven
forged cheques. At the opening of this second trial, a plea of “autrefois
acquit” was entered. Counsel for the respondent also urged upon the trial judge
that he had a discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the
proceedings were oppressive and an abuse of the process of the Court. The trial
judge disallowed the special plea and convicted the respondent. The Court of
Appeal directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered on the ground that the
trial judge should have exercised his discretion by staying the second
indictment because it was so oppressive as to constitute an abuse of the process
of the Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Fauteux
J.: The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Pigeon JJ.: There does not exist in our criminal law a rule that in
the case of a multiplicity of charges successively made on

[Page 185]

the same facts, a trial judge has discretion
to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it is
considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. The duty of the Courts is
to apply the law as it exists. There is no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a Court considers the prosecution oppressive. In our legal
system, it is not considered unfair or oppressive to have an accused undergo
several trials on the same charge when his conviction is quashed even if this
happens repeatedly. A different view should not be taken if the error consists
in not laying the correct charge so that instead of being irregularly convicted
and then ordered to stand a new trial, the accused is acquitted of the
incorrect charge and then brought to second trial on a fresh indictment for the
correct charge.

Per Ritchie,
Hall and Spence JJ.: The question of whether or not the Court has jurisdiction
to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process does not fall to be decided
because there was here no evidence to support the conclusion of the Court of
Appeal that there was oppression. The Court of Appeal placed undue weight on
the long delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to
appeal cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a
right given by statute. In respect of the delay, the record clearly shows that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the accused and not
to the Crown. The Court of Appeal was therefore wrong in concluding that the
trial judge should have stayed the proceedings and was also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], acquitting the
respondent of a charge of conspiring to utter forged cheques. Appeal allowed.

C.M. Powell and Archie Campbell, for the
appellant.

C.G. Stewart McKeown and David R.G.
Griner, for the respondent.

[Page 186]

FAUTEUX J.—I agree that the appeal should be
allowed.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The facts of this case are stated as
follows in the reasons of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1.

On November 23rd, 1965, the appellant, Frederick
John Osborn, while being followed by an officer, was seen to throw an envelope
from the window of an automobile. In the envelope were found seven forged
cheques fully made out to various payees and endorsed. The cheques were
complete save as to the dates on them. Also in the envelope were two pieces of
paper giving the names of payees, together with the addresses of certain banks
and some account numbers. At his trial, the appellant testified that he was
directed to the envelope in a cache by one “Frank” who instructed him to cash
the cheques in return for one third of the proceeds but that, after only
glancing at the contents of the envelope, he had resolved not to cash any of
the cheques. There was no other evidence connecting the appellant with the
forgery of the cheques.

In November, 1965, the appellant was indicted on
a charge that, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, he had in his
possession certain writings, to wit: seven cheques and two pieces of paper that
were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code , Section 312 (b).

After a two day trial with a jury in September,
1966, the appellant was acquitted on a directed verdict. It would appear the
basis for the directed verdict was that the forgeries were complete so that the
cheques could not be held to be adapted or intended to be used to commit
forgery.

An appeal by the Crown was dismissed.

In May, 1967, the appellant was indicted on a
charge of conspiring with a person or persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of uttering seven forged cheques.

At the opening of the second trial in January,
1968, the special defence of autrefois acquit was disallowed by the trial
judge. Counsel for the appellant also urged upon the trial judge that he had a
discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the proceedings were
oppressive and an abuse of

[Page 187]

the process of the Court. No express ruling was
made by the trial judge as to whether he considered he had such a discretionary
power and, after disallowing the plea of autrefois, he simply directed the
trial to proceed. The appellant was convicted.

Appeal is taken to this Court on the sole ground
that the trial judge had a discretion to stay or dismiss the indictment on the
ground that it was so oppressive and vexatious as to amount to an abuse of the
process of the Court and that such discretion should have been exercised in
favour of the appellant.

After referring especially to speeches in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2], Jessup
J.A., speaking for the Court, said:

In civil law the doctrine of res
judicata occupies the same place as the plea of autrefois does in
the criminal law. But apart from res judicata and Rule 126 the Courts of
this Province have from earliest times invoked an inherent jurisdiction to
prevent the abuse of their process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.
The principle on which they have acted is stated by Lord Watson in Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères, (1892) A.C. 61…

* * *

I am unable to recognize any basis or
principle on which such inherent jurisdiction is confined to the civil side of
the Courts or why it cannot be invoked to abate oppression caused by a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts by a private or
Crown prosecutor…

I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. Here, however,
I think that the long delay coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results
in unjust oppressiveness from the second indictment.

With deference, this reasoning is erroneous. The
starting point appears to be that in civil mat-

[Page 188]

ters there is admittedly an inherent
jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings. The case cited to support that assertion, Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères[3], is
indeed concerned with a question of jurisdiction, the matter under
consideration being the contention that the defendant had incurred liability
towards the plaintiff in summarily dismissing a case as vexatious because in so
doing he had allegedly acted without jurisdiction.

In the instant case, it does not appear to me
that I need consider whether the trial judge had jurisdiction to make the order
that the Court of Appeal held he should have made. The real problem, in my
view, is whether there exists in our criminal law a rule that in the case of a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts, a trial judge has
discretion to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it
is considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. In this Court as in the
Court of Appeal, counsel have been unable to cite any case in Canada where such a discretionary rule has
been recognized or acted upon other than the obiter dictum of Mackay
J.A. in Regina v. LeClair[4].

Concerning the opinions expressed in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, it is essential to observe that the
basis of the difficulty in that case was a most important difference between
our criminal law and the criminal law of England in force at that time. Lord Reid said (at p. 1295):

Ever since the passing of the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1908, Parliament has persistently refused to permit a retrial in
respect of the same offence after a verdict of guilty has been quashed on any
ground by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Refusal to allow a new trial has always
been put on the ground of fairness to the accused and I cannot see why, if it
is unfair to allow a retrial for the same offence, it is fair to allow a fresh
trial on the same facts merely because the offence now charged is different.

[Page 189]

In this country, Parliament’s conception of
fairness has always been, on the contrary, that when a conviction is quashed
(Cr. Code, sec. 592(2)) a new trial can be ordered instead of an acquittal
and such is always the order made except in special circumstances.

It is clear that the new “rule of practice”
requiring the inclusion in a single indictment of all charges arising out of
the same facts, that was proposed in Connelly by Lord Devlin and agreed
to by Lord Pearce and Lord Reid, was motivated exclusively by the desire of
avoiding in the future the anomalous result noted by the latter in the passage
above quoted. Everyone, including Lord Devlin, agreed that this new rule, being
a “rule of practice”, should not be applied to the case at hand. Consequently,
it was unanimously decided that there had been no unfairness to the appellant
in trying and convicting him of robbery after his conviction for a murder
committed in the robbery had been quashed for misdirection, the charges of
murder and of robbery having been preferred in separate indictments in
accordance with the practice followed at the time. In thus upholding a strict
application of autrefois acquit in spite of the fact that in reality it
deprived the accused of the benefit of the statutory rule against retrials, the
majority who expressed themselves in favor of a new rule for future cases, did
not in effect differ from the view of the others as to the proper conclusion in
the absence of such a rule. The statutory principle motivating that rule in England having no counterpart in our
criminal law, the views expressed as to the state of the law apart from the
existence of such a rule appear properly applicable to our circumstances. Lord
Morris said (at pp. 1301-1302 and 1304):

The power (which is inherent in a court’s
jurisdiction) to prevent abuses of its process and to control its own procedure
must in a criminal court include a power to safeguard an accused person from
oppression or prejudice. That power, as is demonstrated by a stream of
authority to which I will refer, has, however, never been regarded as endowing
a court with a power to say that evidence given in reference to one charge may
not be repeated in reference to another and different charge. Nor does it
enable a court to order that a prosecution be dropped merely because of some
rather imprecise regret that an accused should have to face another charge…

[Page 190]

It would, in my judgment, be an unfortunate
innovation if it were held that the power of a court to prevent any abuse of
its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a judge to
suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking place.
There is no abuse of process if to a charge which is properly brought before
the court and which is framed in an indictment to which no objection can in any
way be taken there is no plea such as that of autrefois acquit or convict which
can successfully be made.

Lord Hodson said (at pp. 1336 and 1337):

The inherent power of the court to control
its own process, civil or criminal, should not prevent access to the courts
when a lawful claim is presented. So to hold would involve grave interference
with the liberty of the subject to have access to the courts, which I should be
surprised to find to be warranted by authority…

I accept that the history of the
development of our law justifies the contention that all rules of common law
which emanate from the breast of the judges may in a sense be said to be
discretionary in origin, but I cannot concede that there ought to be given to
the judge a discretion, which, in my opinion, he has not hitherto been allowed,
to interfere with anything that he personally thinks is unfair. If one
disclaims such a proposal but seeks to substitute a discretion to determine, in
accordance with principle, whether or not a prosecution should be stopped, I do
not know what principle can be applied.

It is basic in our jurisprudence that the duty
of the courts is to apply the law as it exists, not to enforce it or not in
their discretion. As a general rule, legal remedies are available in an
absolute way ex debito justitiae. Some are discretionary but this does
not destroy the general rule. I can see no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a court considers the prosecution oppressive.

In our legal system, it is not considered unfair
or oppressive to have an accused undergo several trials on the same charge when
his conviction is quashed even if this happens repeatedly. In other words, it
is not considered desirable that a criminal should escape punishment for a
misdeed

[Page 191]

because an error was committed in his trial that
requires his conviction to be quashed. I fail to see why a totally different
view should be taken if the error consists in not laying the correct charge so
that instead of being irregularly convicted and then ordered to stand a new
trial, he is acquitted of the incorrect charge and then brought to second trial
on a fresh indictment for the correct charge.

For those reasons I would allow the appeal,
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and restore the conviction and sentence.

The judgment of Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J.—On November 23, 1965, the respondent was seen
by Detective Douglas Baker of the Metropolitan Police Force seated behind the
wheel of a 1964 Pontiac
automobile, the car being parked on Bloor Street in the City of Toronto. While the car was under observation one Joseph Sullivan approached
the respondent, at which time Detective Baker went to the car and identified
himself as a police officer. He asked for the respondent’s driver’s license
which was not forthcoming. He then questioned the respondent about the car, and
being concerned that the car may have been stolen, said that they would have to
go to No. 11 Police Station. Detective Baker had Sullivan get in the back seat
and he sat in the front seat to the right of the respondent. While proceeding
to No. 11 Police Station, the respondent had to drive through a subway on Dupont Street. While in the subway he was
observed by Detective Baker to reach down to the car floor, pick up what
appeared to be a piece of white paper and throw it out the window on the
driver’s side. The paper was seen by Detective Baker to land close to the north
curb approximately in the centre of the subway. Detective Baker asked what the
paper was and the respondent replied, “Just junk, the car is full of old
paper”. On emerging from the tunnel Detective Baker had the respondent make a
U-turn and go back in the east-bound lane then make another U-turn and into the
subway again. The car was stopped and

[Page 192]

Detective Baker retrieved the paper which he
found to be an envelope containing seven cheques and two pieces of paper. On
showing them to the respondent, saying “What about these?” the respondent
replied: “I don’t know anything about them.” The respondent was directed to
continue to No. 11 Police Station. At the police station, after being
cautioned, he gave a statement which was ruled admissible after a voir dire to
the effect that he had a telephone call from one “Frank” and had been directed to
the envelope which was cached in a toilet paper receptacle in the washroom of
the Brown Derby tavern. He was to get the envelope, cash what cheques he could,
retain one-third of the proceeds and place the balance of the proceeds with any
uncashed cheques back in the place where he had found the envelope. He later
testified to the same effect at his trial.

The respondent was charged:

that he did, on or about the 23rd day of
November, in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the
County of York, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, had in his
possession certain writings, to wit, seven cheques and two pieces of paper,
that were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

The case was heard by His Honour Judge Deyman
and a jury in September 1966. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown,
Judge Deyman, holding that there was no case to go to the jury, directed the
jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal on the ground that the cheques were
complete and there was no evidence connecting the respondent with the actual
forgery of the cheques.

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed the appeal in
January 1967. In May 1967 the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring
with a person or persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit,
uttering of seven forged cheques contrary to the Criminal Code . He was
remanded for trial and eventually came on for trial on January 22, 1968, before
His Honour E.L. Weaver and a jury.

[Page 193]

At the opening of the trial, counsel for the
respondent, before plea was taken, entered the special plea of autrefois
acquit pursuant to the provisions of ss. 516  to 518  of the Criminal
Code . In his submission in support of the plea of autrefois acquit, counsel
for the respondent discussed what would be in effect a defence of res
judicata. The learned trial judge disallowed the special plea of autrefois
acquit. He was right in so doing. His ruling was as follows:

THE COURT: I have come to the conclusion,
from a consideration of the law, that the offence as charged here, of
conspiring, is a completely different offence to the substantive offence either
of possession of forged documents or even of using documents known to be forged.
It is a completely different offence and therefore the plea of autrefois
acquit, or even of res judicata, does not apply, and I will dismiss your
application.

He mentioned res judicata but did not
make any reference to the suggestion that the Court should stay the proceedings
on the ground that they were oppressive. It is clear from the record that the
discussion as to the proceedings being res judicata or being oppressive
were incidental to the submission being made on behalf of the respondent in
respect of his plea of autrefois acquit. Res judicata is not a special
plea within s. 516  of the Criminal Code  but is a substantive defence
which may, in proper circumstances, be raised during the trial.

Following the learned trial judge’s ruling, the
respondent entered a plea of “Not Guilty”, and after a trial on the merits to
which no objection has been taken, he was found “Guilty” and sentenced to 18
months in the reformatory.

Following his conviction, the respondent
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by Notice of Appeal dated February 28, 1968, on the grounds:

1. The conviction was contrary to law.

2. The conviction was contrary to the
evidence and to the weight of evidence.

3. Upon such further and other grounds as
are revealed upon a reading of the transcript of evidence.

[Page 194]

On October 18, 1968, the Notice of Appeal was
amended to read:

The learned trial judge erred in the
exercise of his judicial discretion in failing to stop a prosecution which on
the facts created abuse of process and injustice.

In the Court of Appeal, Jessup J.A. for the
Court[5] said:

Here, however, I think that the long delay
coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results in unjust oppressiveness
from the second indictment. In my view, the learned trial judge would have
properly exercised his jurisdiction by staying the proceedings before him.

He prefaced his conclusion by saying:

In my opinion, therefore, the learned trial
judge should have exercised his discretion as to whether or not he should stay
the second indictment on the ground that it was so oppressive as to constitute
an abuse of the process of the court. Since he failed to address himself to
that decision this Court must do so. I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. (Emphasis
added)

I do not think that the question of whether or
not the Court has jurisdiction to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process
falls to be decided in the instant case because in my view there was here no
evidence to support the conclusion of the learned Justice of Appeal that there
was oppression. The circumstances which I have outlined in greater detail than
might otherwise have been necessary negative any oppressive conduct on the part
of the Crown. Jessup J.A. appears to have placed undue weight on what he calls
“the long delay”. He accepts the proposition that

[Page 195]

in the absence of special circumstances the
laying of a second indictment upon the same facts is not in all cases
productive of injustice or oppression. He mentions only two factors: the long
delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to appeal
cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a right
given by statute and the exercise of that right by the Crown cannot of itself
be oppression. Accordingly it would appear that having eliminated the mere
preferring of the second indictment as being decisive, Jessup J.A. appears to
have been unduly impressed by the delay. Now, in respect of the delay, the
record shows that the appeal from the acquittal on the first indictment was
disposed of in January 1967. The indictment for conspiracy was preferred to the
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York on May 1, 1967, and the respondent
appeared for arraignment on May 12. He was remanded in custody until trial but
soon released on bail to appear for trial on September 18, 1967. He did not appear on
that date and a bench warrant was issued by His Honour Judge MacRae. An
explanation was given that he was in hospital on the morning of September 18
and he was again released on bail to appear for trial on December 1. He did not
appear and a bench warrant was issued and the case remanded to December 18 and
he was ordered to remain in custody. He was granted bail on an appeal to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario and the case remanded peremptorily for
trial on January 22, 1968, on which date the trial began.

Then, in regard to the delay between the time of
his conviction and his appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I pointed out previously that the
original Notice of Appeal was dated February 28, 1968, and amended some eight
months later on October 18, 1968, and judgment given on November 25, 1968. It is, therefore, clear that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the respondent and
not to the Crown.

I am of the view that the learned trial judge
was right in ruling that the charge of conspiracy should be proceeded with and
the Court of Appeal was wrong in concluding that he should

[Page 196]

have stayed the proceedings and also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and
restore the conviction. Leave to appeal was granted on the terms that the
appellant would pay to the respondent his costs in this Court, including the
costs of the motion for leave to appeal, the whole on a solicitor and client
basis in any event of the cause. The order allowing the appeal should,
therefore, provide for payment of the respondent’s costs in accordance with the
order giving leave.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NOVA
SCOTIA

Trial—Defences—Mistake—Charge of driving
without a licence—Licence revoked for criminal driving offence but reinstated
pending appeal—Respondent knew appeal dismissed but not officially notified of
revocation following appeal—Absence of mens rea—Whether or not charge one of
strict liability so importing defence of mistake of fact—Whether or not effect
to be given to defence of “officially induced error”—Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S.
1967, c. 191, ss. 250,258(2).

Respondent’s driving privileges, cancelled
following his conviction for a driving related criminal offence, were
reinstated during the appeal process and finally revoked on the appeal’s
dismissal. Although aware of the disposition of the appeal, respondent had not
yet received the Order of Revocation of License when he was stopped by police
and asked to present his licence. A summary offence ticket was later issued to
respondent charging him with driving while his licence was cancelled. This
appeal related to that charge. The trial judge’s decision to dismiss it was
upheld on appeal by both the County Court and the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The offence created by s. 258(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act was one of strict liability and a defence was available to the
accused if he “reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true,
would render” his act of continuing to drive without a licence, an innocent
one. Respondent’s mistake, however, because of s. 250(3) of the Act, was
one of law in relation to his right to drive after his appeal had been
dismissed. The effect

[Page 606]

of s. 19 of the Criminal Code, which
provides that ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an
excuse for committing that offence, is that a mistake of law does not afford
respondent a defence. As the accused was not misled by an error on the part of
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, it was unnecessary to consider a defence of
justification arising in the situation of a mistake of law occasioned by
“officially induced error”.

R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, considered; R. v. Prue, R. v. Baril, [1979]
2 S.C.R. 547, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 137, 46 N.S.R. (2d) 47, 89 A.P.R. 47,
dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Sullivan C.C.J. affirming a judgment of
Campbell P.C.J. dismissing the charge against respondent. Appeal allowed.

Kenneth Fiske and Dana Giovannetti, for the
appellant.

Hugh Maclsaac and Harold A. Maclsaac, for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought by leave of
this Court from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia (Jones J. dissenting) dismissing an appeal from a judgment of His Honour
Judge Alan E. Sullivan affirming the judgment rendered at trial by Judge S.D.
Campbell by which that judge dismissed the charge laid against the respondent
for driving his motor vehicle while his licence was cancelled, contrary to
s. 258(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 191, which
reads as follows:.

258. …

(2) A person shall not drive a motor
vehicle while his license or privilege of obtaining a license is cancelled or
suspended under this Act.

[Page 607]

Leave to appeal to this Court was sought on the
following questions of law, namely:

1. That the majority of the Appeal Division of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia erred in law in giving effect to the defence
of officially induced error;

2. That the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia erred in law in holding that an offence under ss. (2) of
s. 258 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 191 as amended is an
offence of strict liability rather than an offence of absolute liability.

It will be more convenient in my view to first
consider the second of these grounds as it is essential before proceeding with
any consideration of the issues raised by this appeal to be satisfied as to the
nature of the offence with which the respondent is charged.

Three classes of statutory offences have been
recognized in the reasons for judgment of my brother Dickson in R. v. Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1325-26 where he said:

I conclude, for the reasons which I have
sought to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of
three categories of offences rather than the traditional two:

1. Offences in which mens rea, consisting
of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must
be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed, or by additional evidence.

2. Offences in which there is no necessity
for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing
of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open
to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care.
This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in the
circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably
believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or
omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the
particular event. These offences may properly be called offences of strict
liability. Mr. Justice Estey so referred to them in Hickey’s case.

[Page 608]

3. Offences of absolute liability where it
is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of
fault.

[The underlining is mine]

In the same case, Mr. Justice Dickson went on
to say:

Offences which are criminal in the true
sense fall in the first category. Public welfare offences would prima facie be
in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea. An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such
words as “wilfully,” “with intent,” “knowingly,” or “intentionally” are
contained in the statutory provision creating the offence. On the other hand,
the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on those without
fault applies. Offences of absolute liability would be those in respect of
which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of
the proscribed act. The overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature,
the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the
precision of the language used will be primary considerations in determining
whether the offence falls into the third category.

I am in agreement with all of the judges in the
courts below, including the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, in finding
that as the offence here charged is one concerning the public welfare it was
properly characterized as “an offence of strict liability” within the meaning
of the classification stipulated by Mr. Justice Dickson (supra) and
that a defence is accordingly available to the accused if he “reasonably
believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render” his act in
continuing to drive his motor vehicle without a licence, an innocent one.

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are
not seriously in dispute and can be summarized in their essentials as follows:

On March 6, 1979 the respondent was convicted of
“fail duty at scene of accident contrary to section 233-2 of the Criminal
Code,” as a result of which an order of revocation of his licence to drive

[Page 609]

was sent to him on April 10, 1979 by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles of the Province of Nova Scotia in conformity with
the provisions of s. 250(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. In due course
the respondent appealed his conviction and on May 1, 1979 a notice of
re-instatement of his driving privileges as of that date was sent to him. On
December 21, 1979 a written decision was filed with the Clerk of the County
Court dismissing the appeal and, of particular importance in this case, some
time in January 1980, the respondent’s solicitor advised him of the fact that
his appeal had been dismissed.

It was not until January 25, 1980, at about 9
a.m., that the respondent was stopped by the R.C.M.P. while driving to work in
his motor vehicle at which time his licence was called for by the police. On
the evening of the same day the respondent received in his mail a notice
entitled “Order of Revocation of License” signed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
purporting to be issued “pursuant to the authority vested in… [him] by Section
250 of the Motor Vehicle Act.”

It was not until March 11, 1980 that a summary
offence ticket was issued to the respondent charging him with the offence with
which we are now concerned. As the actions of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
purported to be in the exercise of his authority under s. 250 of the Motor
Vehicle Act, I find it desirable to reproduce the relevant portions of that
section in full. That section reads as follows and I have underlined
those portions which I consider to be particularly relevant:

250 (1)
Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Registrar or the Director of
Highway Safety shall revoke effective the date of conviction the driver’s
license of any person upon receiving a record of his conviction for any of the
following crimes or offences:

(a) manslaughter resulting from the
operation of a motor vehicle, in violation of Section 219 of the Criminal Code;

(b) an offence against Section 203, 204,
233, 234, 235, 236, 238 or 295 of the Criminal Code;

(c) theft of a motor vehicle in violation
of Section 294 of the Criminal Code;

(d) any offence against the Criminal Code
designated by the Governor in Council;

[Page 610]

(e) making a false affidavit, declaration
or statement to the Department or the Registrar in violation of this Act; or

(f) a violation of Section 258 of this Act.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) but
subject to subsections (3) and (4), when a person is convicted of any
of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1), the driver’s
license or the privilege of obtaining a driver’s license is thereupon and
hereby revoked and shall remain revoked.

(3) When a person appeals against a
conviction for an offence mentioned in subsection (1) in the manner
prescribed by law, the person shall be deemed not to be convicted for the
purpose of subsections (1) and (2) and the provisions of this Act until
the appeal is heard, determined and dismissed or is abandoned or the right to
proceed with the appeal extinguished and the driver’s license or the privilege
of obtaining a driver’s license shall be thereupon and hereby revoked and shall
remain revoked.

(4) A person whose driver’s license is revoked
under this Section may drive a motor vehicle until noon the third day after the
date of his conviction as will permit him to return to his place of residence
or to sell or dispose of a motor vehicle registered in his name.

(5) When a court or magistrate convicts a
person of any of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1), the
court or magistrate shall communicate to the person the effect of this Section,
but the failure to do so shall not affect in any way the validity of the
revocation.

(6) When a court or magistrate convicts a
person of any of the crimes or offences mentioned in subsection (1) the
person whose license is revoked shall produce the license forthwith to the
court or magistrate who shall make thereon an endorsement in the following
words or words to the like effect;

“not
valid as of noon the

day
of , 19”

and he shall sign the endorsement, but the
failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the revocation.

(7) When a person appeals against a
conviction for an offence mentioned in subsection (1) in the manner
prescribed by law, the court or magistrate whose conviction is appealed from
may endorse the driver’s license using the following words or words to like
effect:

[Page 611]

“Revocation stayed pending appeal,”

and he shall date and sign the endorsement.

(8) Where an appeal is heard, determined
and dismissed or is abandoned or the right to proceed with the appeal is
extinguished, the court to which the appeal was made or the Registrar may order
the person to appear and surrender his driver’s license and the order may be
enforced by a peace officer.

The respondent does not question the validity of
his conviction on March 6, 1979 for a breach of s. 233(2) of the Criminal
Code nor the notice of the order of revocation of his licence which was
sent to him on April 10 of that year by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. It is
apparent that pursuant to s. 250(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, proof
of such conviction carries with it a mandatory requirement that the Registrar
shall revoke the licence of a convicted driver, but what is at issue here is
the status of such a driver after he has asserted an appeal from his conviction
and this involves a close consideration of s. 250(3) which provides that
when a person who has been convicted under s. 233 of the Criminal Code appeals
against that conviction he “shall be deemed not to be convicted for the purpose
of subsection… (1)… [of s. 250] until the appeal has been heard and
dismissed” and “the driver’s license or the privilege of obtaining a driver’s
license shall be thereupon and hereby revoked and shall remain revoked.”

In acquitting the respondent the trial judge
made the following findings with respect to the effect of the notice entitled
“Order of Revocation of License” which was not received by MacDougall until the
afternoon of January 25 whereas the present charge alleges a breach of
s. 258 of the Motor Vehicle Act at 9 a.m. on the morning of that
day.

In this respect the learned trial judge found:

I believe Mr. MacDougall when he says
that the actual certified mail arrived that afternoon and the remaining
question, one of law and one of fact to be disposed of, is whether or not that
he believed that he was entitled to

[Page 612]

drive and whether or not that gives him a
defence. First of all, I believe Mr. MacDougall when he tells me he was
under the honest impression that he was entitled to drive pending some
notification from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Registrar specifically,
telling him that he was once again suspended from driving as a result of the
disposition of his appeal. I base that on his appearance and testimony that he
gave on the stand, his behaviour when he was accosted, he was open and obvious
in his driving…

The trial judge also found of MacDougall that

His previous experiences with the notices
from the Department and the correspondence from the Department, I would take it
to lean Mr. MacDougall towards the legitimate understanding that he might
reasonably expect further indication from the Department, after the appeal was
disposed of.

His Honour Judge Sullivan and the majority of
the Court of Appeal affirmed these findings and held that they disclosed a
defence to the charge here laid on the ground that they disclosed a mistake of
fact on the part of the accused within the meaning of R. v. Sault Ste. Marie
(supra), whereas I am unable to treat the respondent’s
mistake otherwise than as a mistake of law in relation to his right, because of
s. 250 (3), to drive after his appeal had been dismissed. This was a
mistake of law which does not afford the respondent a defence having regard to
s. 19 of the Criminal Code which provides that:

19.
Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an excuse for
committing that offence.

This is no more than a codification of the
common law rule and undoubtedly applies in the present case.

In this regard Macdonald J.A., speaking on
behalf of the Court of Appeal, introduced a new concept in the law of mistake,
saying:

On the particular facts of this case and in
light of what I have just said I am not convinced that the mistake of the respondent
as to the effective date or time of revocation of his license was purely one of
law. It was a reasonable mistake based on certain acts of the Registrar and may
be but an error of fact or a mix of both fact and law.

[Page 613]

Assuming however that the error of the
respondent as to revocation was one of law I am prepared to say that the facts
as found by the trial judge give rise to a defence of justification based upon
reliance by the respondent on a previous course of conduct on the part of the Registrar.
This defence might be classified as officially induced error or perhaps as a
form of colour of right.

It is not difficult to envisage a situation in
which an offence could be committed under mistake of law arising because of,
and therefore induced by, “officially induced error’, and if there was evidence
in the present case to support such a situation existing it might well be an
appropriate vehicle for applying the reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice
Macdonald. In the present case, however, there is no evidence that the accused
was misled by an error on the part of the Registrar. The only reference which I
have been able to find in the testimony of the accused which could even suggest
such a thing is the following passage from his cross‑examination:

Q. But in any event sir, you did receive a
notification of revocation of license on the 10th of April 1979?

A. 10th of April…

Q. Well, at least it was dated the 10th of
April?

A. Yes.

Q. At that point you knew for sure that
your license was revoked?

A. No, not exactly, on this particular, the
10th of April, yes that the license had been revoked at that particular time,
over that particular charge.

Q. So at that particular time you knew that
it was revoked?

A. Yes, on advice of the Motor Vehicle
Department.

Q. Yes, that is basically what I am asking
you, you then filed a notice of appeal in the matter, did you not?

A. Yes I did.

Q. You appealled [sic] the
decision, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Subsequent to filing the notice of
appeal, you received a notice of reinstatement from the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles?

A. I did.

[Page 614]

Q. That was given subject to the outcome of
the appeal case?

A. Pending, restored pending outcome of
appeal.

And earlier Mr. MacDougall had given the
following evidence:

Q. Having received notice of the appeal
having been lost, Mr. MacDougall, did it at all appear to you that maybe
your license would be under suspension?

A. Well as I understood it, there would be
a notice of license suspension coming to me at sometime, yes.

Q. Did you realize that you may be under
suspension at that very moment?

A. Not at that particular time, no.

Q. You were waiting then the notification
from the Registrar of Motor Vehicles?

A. Well, as in the past, notification had
been received from Motor Vehicles, with regards to the previous accident, so I
was under the assumption that until such time as that notice would be received,
I was still able to drive a car.

It would be difficult to conceive of more clear
or imperative language than that contained in s. 250(3) of the Motor
Vehicle Act whereby the driver’s licence shall be automatically “revoked
and shall remain revoked” if an appeal is “dismissed”. The failure to
appreciate the legal duty imposed by that law is of no solace to the appellant.

Before concluding, I should make mention of R.
v. Prue, R. v. Baril, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547, in which the majority of the
Court held that, for the purposes of the Criminal Code, whether there
has been an effective suspension is simply a question of fact. The case arose
under s. 238(3) of the Criminal Code and the majority decision,
delivered by the Chief Justice at p. 552, makes it clear that a
distinction may be drawn between enforcement of a driving offence under the Criminal
Code and one for the enforcement of a provincial enactment.

In my opinion, the issue of ignorance of
fact or ignorance of law is properly applicable to the enforcement of the
provincial enactment under which the suspension

[Page 615]

from driving is made and not to the
enforcement of s. 238(3) of the Criminal Code.

I am of the opinion that nothing in the
foregoing reasons runs counter to the decision of the Court in Prue and Baril.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J.

3DAVIES J: On 17 February 2012 the Applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing eight counts of make a false statement with intent to obtain money contrary to s 178BB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of cause unauthorised computer function with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence contrary to s 308C Crimes Act. In addition the Applicant admitted five further offences of obtaining a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act which were taken into account on a Form 1. 

4All of the sentences carried a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 

5The Sentencing Judge, Judge Williams, imposed an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of two years and six months imprisonment with an additional term of one year and six months with the sentence commencing 24 February 2012, the non-parole period expiring on 23 August 2014 and the additional term expiring on 23 February 2016. His Honour gave an indicative sentence in relation to Count 1 taking into account the offences on the Form 1 of three years imprisonment and in relation to Counts 2 - 9, on each count two years imprisonment. 

6Count 1 was that between 13 November 2004 and 6 June 2006 with intent to obtain money for herself, the Applicant made a statement that she was not being paid by RailCorp knowing it to be false in a material particular, namely, that she was being paid by RailCorp during that period of time.
7Counts 2 - 7 and Count 9 were that between various specified dates the Applicant with intent to obtain money for Kuipers Excavations made a statement on an identified docket number that services requiring the payment of a specified sum had been rendered by that company between specified dates knowing that to be false in a material particular, namely, that Kuipers Excavations had not rendered the said services. 

8Count 8 charged that between specified dates the Applicant caused an unauthorised computer function, namely, that she accessed the PHIPS (Plant Hire Internet Procurement System) and altered the email address of Robert Katz to her own email address, knowing that function to be unauthorised and with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence, namely, obtaining a benefit by deception by herself. 

9The offences arose from an enquiry in 2007 by the Independent Commission Against Corruption which reported in August 2008 on an investigation into bribery and fraud at RailCorp. 

Background facts

10The agreed facts were contained in a 17 page document which the Sentencing Judge annexed to his Remarks on Sentence. They may be conveniently summarised as follows.

11The facts disclosed offending between 13 November 2004 and 5 May 2006 when the Applicant was employed by RailCorp, first, on a contractual basis from about November 2001 and then from 20 June 2005 as a temporary employee. 

12Her initial position, whilst as a contractor, was the PHIPS Support Officer/Administrator within the Infrastructure Procurement Section at Railcorp. On 22 September 2003 she was promoted to the position of Contracts Relationship Manager in that Section. From that time she was required to submit her own invoices to Railcorp for the work she did. From 20 June 2005, when she became a temporary employee, her remuneration package was $91,500.

13The Applicant admitted that during this period she and a sub-contractor Kuipers Excavations caused RailCorp to pay out $509, 637.70 through the creation of false records for work not actually carried out. Ultimately Kuipers Excavations obtained $489,108.20, of which $366,000 was passed onto the Applicant with approximately $20,000 being retained by Plant Service Managers (PSMs) who processed the invoices as administrative/management fees.

14The Applicant in her position of trust with RailCorp, supervised the payments through the RailCorp computer system to contractors for various works carried out by them for RailCorp. External PSMs were organisations that were retained by RailCorp to provide the 'plant' or 'equipment.' They organised subcontractors and charged an administrative/management fee for doing this.

15The key PSMs were Total Plant Services (TPS) and Kingston Rail Management (Kingston). One of the subcontractors they both used was Kuipers Excavations which was owned by William Kuipers. TPS and Kingston would send invoices to RailCorp which were then paid through the RailCorp computer system. The PSM would then pay the relevant subcontractor such as Kuipers Excavations.

16The Applicant was a personal friend of Mr Kuipers having worked with him previously. In around November or December 2004 the Applicant falsely told Mr Kuipers that she was not being paid by RailCorp and was in financial difficulty. The Applicant also falsely told Mr Kuipers that her boss had approved him paying her and that Mr Kuipers would then be reimbursed through the use of the Plant Service Management scheme.

17As a result of these false statements Mr Kuipers gave the Applicant $5000 on the spot and then from around 12 December 2004 a series of payments were regularly made from Kuipers Excavations' bank account to the Applicant's bank account. They were generally $5000 and made on a weekly basis. The last amount was transferred on 5 June 2006. The total amount the Applicant received in her account from Kuipers Excavations over the 18 month period was $366,000. The Applicant repeatedly told Mr Kuipers during this period that she was owed wages by RailCorp.

18The way that the Applicant recouped the funds she was receiving from Kuipers Excavations during this period was generally by falsely creating documentation in relation to work (orders). When invoices came from Kuipers Excavation falsely claiming the work had been done she authorised them to be paid from the RailCorp side.

19These false invoices were processed through the external PSMs - TPS and Kingston. After they submitted the invoices RailCorp paid the PSM who then reimbursed Kuipers Excavations less an administrative/management fee that the PSM retained.

20The charge in Count 1 was representative of the scheme outlined above. It related to the entire period between 13 November 2004 and 6 June 2006. It related to the Applicant making false statements to Mr Kuipers that she was not being paid by RailCorp during that period of time with the intention of obtaining money for herself (the $366,000) rather than Kuipers Excavations. 

21The other 7 charges of make false statement on the indictment were representative counts. They identified particular RailCorp dockets where the Applicant falsely stated that services had been rendered with the intention of Kuipers Excavations receiving money for those services which the Applicant knew had in fact not been supplied. In each case Kuipers Excavations received the relevant payment less the administrative fee retained by the PSM. The various docket numbers and amounts were set out in the terms of the indictment and the agreed facts.

22The one charge (Count 8) of cause unauthorised computer function with the intent to facilitate the commission of a serious indictable offence (obtaining a benefit by deception) related to the Applicant accessing the RailCorp system in order to re-route her supervisor's emails to her own email address so that false orders created with her supervisor as the approver would not be actually received by her supervisor. Instead, it would be forwarded to the Applicant's email address and they could be approved without her supervisor's knowledge.

23The offences on the Form 1 related to further false dockets/orders created by the Applicant for the purposes of payment being made to Kuipers Excavations. In conjunction with creating some of the false dockets the Applicant also had, on occasions, to make misrepresentations about the dockets to other people (including the general manager of TPS (Paul Knowles) and the rail manager at Kingston (Paul Roberts)) in order to ensure Kuipers Excavations were paid for work she knew they hadn't done. There were five counts of obtain benefit by deception in relation to these on a Form 1 attached to Count 1.

Subjective factors

24The frauds appear to have been carried out to sustain the Applicant's gambling habit. The Applicant gave evidence to that effect before the Sentencing Judge. In addition, the Sentencing Judge had reports from a psychologist, Mr Peter Champion, from Mr George Bowie, a gambling addictions counsellor who had been seeing the Applicant after a referral by Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006, and from the Probation and Parole Service, all of which provided largely consistent information about the Applicant's gambling addiction. 

25The Plaintiff had been sentenced on 15 August 2000 by Penrith Local Court for a number of offences of making a false representation to obtain a benefit from the Commonwealth. Those offences concerned frauds on CentreLink in respect of amounts totalling more than $100,000. The Applicant was sentenced to a six month period of periodic detention. 

26The Applicant resigned from RailCorp on 4 April 2006. She obtained the position of Club Secretary at the Penrith Junior Rugby League Football Club. Whilst in that position she defrauded the club of about $9000 in August and September 2006. She was ultimately charged with six counts of obtain money by deception and sentenced by Penrith Local Court on 20 December 2006 to 9 months home detention.

27Prior to being charged with those offences and prior to the ICAC investigation the Applicant attended Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006. The evidence suggests that she has not gambled since that time.

28The Applicant's mother gave birth to her when she was 16 years old. The mother, who was of Aboriginal descent, was an alcoholic. The Applicant's father was physically violent towards the Applicant and her mother. The relationship between the Applicant and her mother was poor.

29The Applicant was physically and sexually abused by her uncle who lived with them from the time she was six years old until she was about 12 years old. In addition, the Applicant was raped by the local shopkeeper when she was 14 years old and became pregnant as a result. With support and financial assistance from her school friends the Applicant had an abortion but had to lie about her age to have the procedure done. She was also sexually abused by another man who lived near her grandfather's place. 

30The Applicant said that from a young age she would sit and watch her father gambling on card machines and betting on the trots at the local pub. The Applicant herself had been gambling on poker machines for the past 19 years before she came to treatment with Mr Bowie shortly after attending at Gamblers Anonymous. 

31The Applicant has three children. Her eldest daughter was born when the Applicant was 18, the father being a person with whom the Applicant was in a de facto relationship. By the time of the daughter's birth she was in a relationship with another man. That relationship did not last and she married her first husband in about 1994. A son was born to that relationship. She said her husband was a controlling, materialistic man who became violent. She ended the relationship in 1998 after he had an affair.

32She met her present husband in 1999 when she was 30 years old. Although there were problems in the relationship because of her gambling and his over-use of alcohol each managed to resolve their issues and they were married when the Applicant turned 40 in about 2009. A daughter was born in 2010 and is now aged about 2 years and 8 months.

33As mentioned, the evidence was that the Applicant has not gambled since 9 October 2006 when she first went to Gamblers Anonymous and thereafter to Mr Bowie. She continued to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings. She became a sponsor to others who were dealing with gambling issues and she has given lectures to various groups to assist people to deal with gambling problems.

Grounds of appeal

34The Applicant appeals on four grounds as follows:

1. The sentencing judge erred by failing to have regard to the considerable assistance provided by the applicant and her entitlement to a discount pursuant to section 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

2. The sentencing judge erred in the conclusion that the delay in the prosecution of this case was only worthy of ""some"" mitigation on penalty.

3. The sentencing judge erred by having regard to criminality;

(a) in respect of which the applicant was not charged and

(b) which gave rise to a more serious criminality than that in respect of which the applicant was charged falling foul of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383.

4. The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case.

Ground 1: Discount for assistance

35The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge said nothing about her offers to assist in the prosecution of the co-offender Mr Kuipers and said nothing about the operation of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 23 enables the Court to impose a lesser penalty having regard to assistance which has been given or is undertaken to be given to law enforcement authorities.

36In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said only this:

On 24 May 2007 she agreed to speak to ICAC investigators. She fully disclosed her wrongdoing and indicated a willingness to provide further information. 

In addition, his Honour noted a submission by her counsel at the sentencing hearing that a number of matters including ""her help to the investigators"" justified a custodial penalty that could be served in the community. 

37His Honour did not make further reference to her assistance. He gave a discount of 25% for her plea of guilty and said she was entitled to a further discount (which he did not specify) for the delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation. 
38No charges were laid against Mr Kuipers arising out of the arrangement between the Applicant and him. He was prosecuted only for giving false evidence to ICAC that the Applicant was the only Railcorp officer that he had paid. In fact he had paid another person, Alan Walker. The evidence given by the Applicant to ICAC (both to the investigators and at hearings) did not relate to payments by Mr Kuipers to Mr Walker. The Crown submitted, therefore, that the value of her offer of assistance was extremely limited.

39The Applicant pointed to two letters from the Applicant's solicitor who represented her at the ICAC enquiry which were tendered to the Sentencing Judge. The first letter dated 9 July 2007 addressed to ICAC relevantly said:

Ms Hughes and myself met with you prior to the hearing and Ms Hughes showed you some documentation she had brought with her as potentially relevant. These comprised:

* File relating to a previous workplace assault discussed in the first hearing
* PHIPS system (sic) testing manual
* Chart describing the Plant Hire procurement process (2002)
* An OH&S manual developed by a Railcorp employee and apparently sold independently to a 3rd party company.

You suggested that these be tendered as exhibits per s35 and this subsequently occurred

During the pre-hearing discussion, Ms Hughes volunteered a number of subject areas you might wish to question her on, including the abovementioned OH&S manual.

...

You confirmed that Ms Hughes' evidence had been useful to ICAC's broader investigation of Railcorp, although the actual value would have to be assessed in some detail as the investigation progressed. Only then could ICAC provide documentation which could be used on sentencing Ms Hughes in relation to future criminal charges.

40The second letter dated 21 December 2011 relevantly said:

It appeared to me that Renea's cooperation with the ICAC investigation, including a lengthy interview and compulsory examination, could scarcely have been more complete. From ICAC's initial contact she appeared to be at pains to at least partially atone for her wrongdoing by making full and frank disclosure not only as to her own activities but as to the activities of others. It was understood at the time that ICAC would acknowledge Renea's assistance by providing a letter which could be used in sentencing proceedings. 

No letter or documentation was provided by ICAC as the letters envisaged.

41The Applicant drew attention to the particular matters in s 23(2) which the sentencing court is bound to consider and submitted that a combined discount of 60% should have been given for the early plea and the assistance.

42Subsequent to the hearing of the appeal, and with leave, the Applicant filed two affidavits annexing portions of ICAC's report into corruption at RailCorp and into the fraud concerning the Applicant and Mr Kuipers. The report acknowledged the extensive admissions made by the Applicant both in the course of her evidence before the public enquiry (given following a declaration made pursuant to s 38 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988) and also to the previously made admissions when she was interviewed by ICAC investigators on 24 May 2007. 

43In referring the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions the report noted that there were numerous witnesses who would be potentially available to the DPP to attest to relevant activities on the part of the Applicant. Nevertheless, that is not to diminish the significance of the early admissions made by her. 

44The particular part of the report dealing with Mr and Mrs Kuipers found that Mr and Mrs Kuipers were aware that the Applicant was not entitled to the money she obtained through their assistance and that Kuipers Excavations' recovery of the funds was dishonest. The report summarised the evidence ICAC relied on to reach that conclusion. It is clear from that summary that there was a great deal of evidence, quite independent of admissions made by Ms Hughes, that enabled the ICAC to reach that conclusion.

45It is clear, nevertheless, that the Applicant did assist, and undertook to assist, law enforcement authorities in the investigation of or in proceedings relating to the offences for which she was charged. She did so at an early time (s 23(2)(e)), the evidence was truthful and reliable (s 23(2)(c)) and its nature was such that, as ICAC recognised, her evidence would have been relevant if Mr and Mrs Kuipers had been prosecuted for their part in the fraud (s 23(2)(d)). The assistance was of limited usefulness but that was partly because Mr and Mrs Kuipers were not prosecuted for their involvement in the fraud (s 23(2)(b)).

46Section 23(4) requires the Court, which imposes a lesser penalty because the offender has assisted or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities, to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed and to state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced by taking into account the assistance. The Sentencing Judge did not do that.

47Where his Honour made no express reference to any discount for assistance nor to s 23 of the Act it is reasonable to infer that no discount was provided for the assistance: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 234 per Hunt J. The assistance was given but it was limited. In my opinion a discount of 10% ought to have been given.

48This ground is made out.

Ground 2: Delay in prosecution

49The Applicant appears to have first been interviewed by ICAC investigators on 24 May 2007. At that time she made relevant admissions. Public hearings followed and the report was issued in August 2008. The matter was referred to the Office of the DPP but Court Attendance Notices were not sent to the Applicant until 17 March 2011. 

50In relation to delay his Honour said this:

It is not disputed that there has been a significant delay in the prosecution by which she is entitled to some mitigation of penalty.

A little later he said:
As to delay, where an offender has been left in uncertain suspense and has demonstrated rehabilitation in the intervening period, as well as the public interest in serious offending being dealt with quickly and fairly, then that requires that the delay be taken into account on sentence and I refer there to the case of R v Blanco (1999) NSWCCA 121. Ms Hughes was of course in a trusted position, administering payments within a system designed to try and minimise fraud and/or corruption.

Finally he said:

She is entitled to a twenty-five per cent discount for her plea of guilty and she is also entitled to a further discount for the delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation.

His Honour did not specify what the further discount was.

51In Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 Wood CJ at CL (with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed) said:

[15] His Honour, as I have already indicated, expressly stated that he had not overlooked the fact of delay, however, it does not appear from the reasons for sentence precisely what reduction was given for that factor.

[16] The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: See, in addition to Todd and Mill, the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 24 February 1998).
...

[26] Having regard to those decisions, I have reached the conclusion that the present sentence falls outside the legitimate range once allowance is made for the inordinate and unexplained delay in the prosecution of the appellant... The adjustment, however, is not an adjustment which I consider should be particularly significant having regard to the very substantial criminality of the present offender.

52In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 the delay in sentencing the appellant arose from a sentence he was serving in Queensland for offences committed in that state just after he committed offences in New South Wales. The sentencing judge had said that the only relevance of the Queensland sentence was the light that it might shed on his rehabilitation.

53Street CJ (with whom Moffitt P and Nagle CJ at CL agreed) said (at 519):

I have formed the conclusion that his Honour fell into error in thus
placing aside the sentences served by the appellant in Queensland as having no relevance except in so far as they may shed some light upon his present state of rehabilitation.

...

Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether
due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls
for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue
degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.

54This reasoning was endorsed in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 65-66 where it was made clear that the principle is not confined to the fixing of the non-parole period but applies also to the fixing of the head sentence.

55Two matters are significant in the present case relevant to the issue of delay. First, the Applicant married her present husband and gave birth to their child (her third child) in the period between the first admissions made by her to investigators in May 2007 and when she was first charged on 17 March 2011. Secondly, there was significant evidence of rehabilitation from the time she first approached Gamblers Anonymous in October 2006 and the time she was sentenced.

56Mr Bowie said in his report dated 16 February 2012:

Based on my experience in the last 13 years of treating people with gambling addiction and the associated underlying issues, I would go as far as to say that of any recovering problem gambler I have treated were to relapse, Renea would be the last person I would expect to do so. Therefore the likelihood of Renea re-offending as a result of gambling appears to be significantly minimal.

57In his report dated 17 July 2011 Mr Champion said:

[20] ... She reported that she had not gambled for 4 years, 9 months and 7 days (as of the day I saw her), and not unreasonably took some pride in this; she also speaking of the role she was playing in assisting other gamblers in various ways, including public speaking.

...

[39] In regards to her prognosis the obvious concern is that Ms Hughes has now on 3 separated occasions and in 3 different contexts been involved in personal dishonesty. The further concern is that she gives a history of gambling from age 18 or so until some 4 1/2 years ago. The further concern is that she does not appear to be psychologically well. If she can continue to avoid gambling and can utilise treatment in various forms then this could serve to limit the risk of further similar offending. I note her report that she has assisted other gamblers either through the Wesley program (including public speaking) or those involved in home detention. If as she says she has avoided gambling for 4+ years then this is clearly as positive sign, though in the end, given the risk factors I could not rate her prognosis as better than guarded, though on the face of it progress has been made in addressing some of the major risk factors.

58 As in Blanco the delay is unexplained. By comparison with Todd, the delay was not connected with other criminality of the Applicant. If it is appropriate to provide leniency (even ""undue leniency"") in the case of delay brought about by wrongdoing on an applicant's part it must follow that where there is unexplained delay of a lengthy period during which there has been progress towards rehabilitation and/or a change of circumstances that increases the hardship brought about by a custodial sentence it may be appropriate for a court to impose a sentence that would otherwise be considered to fall below the range of an appropriate sentence taking into account all other matters.

59Although the Sentencing Judge said that the Applicant is entitled to some discount for delay he has neither specified what that discount was nor what his notional starting point for the sentence was. It must be assumed that he has discounted for the delay but in the absence of any figures it is not possible to determine if this ground of appeal has been made out. Application of the principles discussed above will be considered further when dealing with Ground 4. 

Ground 3: Having regard to matters not the subject of the charges

60In her written submissions the Applicant pointed to a number of findings made by the Sentencing Judge concerning moneys taken totalling $366,000. It was submitted that the Remarks showed that the Sentencing Judge sentenced the Applicant as if she had been charged with larceny by a servant whereas the charges only concerned amounts totalling $125,000 from the time that she was employed by RailCorp. 

61In her oral submissions the Applicant acknowledged that the Crown was entitled to rely upon the fact of $366,000 being obtained pursuant to the first count. The argument in relation to this ground was put on the basis that the Sentence Judge had found as an aggravating feature that the Applicant was an employee of RailCorp throughout the time of the fraudulent scheme and that she was being paid $91,000 per year as salary there. This was said to offend the principle articulated in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.

62The approach taken by the Applicant in her oral submissions of accepting the relevance for sentencing purposes of the receipt of the $366,000 was entirely appropriate bearing in mind the agreed facts upon which the Applicant had been sentenced. Those facts made it clear that the counts on the indictment and the Form 1 were representative counts and that the payments made to the Applicant had totalled $366,000. 

63Whilst it is certainly the case that the Sentencing Judge appears to have assumed that the Applicant became an employee of RailCorp in November 2001, and made reference elsewhere in his remarks to her annual salary of approximately $91,000, two things are clear. First, when the Applicant became an employee of RailCorp she was paid $91,000 per year and she continued with the fraudulent scheme during the whole time she was so employed. Secondly, even when she was not an employee of RailCorp but was contracted to them she was in an undoubted position of trust by reason of the contractual arrangements. 

64Although not directly employed by Railcorp before 20 June 2005 her position (as noted earlier) from 22 September 2003 was Contracts Relationship Manager in Infrastructure Procurement. It was by reason of that position, and later as a direct employee of RailCorp, that she was able to implement and pursue the fraudulent scheme. The positions were ones of trust as she acknowledged in the agreed facts. 

65It seems to me that the Sentencing Judge's error in referring to her as an employee with RailCorp from November 2001 is an error of no substance in all of the circumstances. It cannot be said that the Sentencing Judge regarded her position as an employee as one of aggravation in a manner inconsistent with the principle in De Simoni at 389 per Gibbs CJ. The significant point was not her employment so much as the breach of trust involved in the positions which she occupied that enabled the fraud to be perpetrated.

66This ground is not made out.

Ground 4: Sentence manifestly excessive

67If it is assumed that the only discount provided by the Sentencing Judge was the 25% for the early plea the notional starting point was a little over 5 years and 4 months. As noted earlier, although no discount was specified for ""delay in prosecution and her remorse and rehabilitation"", the Sentencing Judge said that she was entitled to further discount for those matters. It must be assumed, therefore, that the notional starting point was higher. The Applicant, in her written submissions, said:

The sentence in this case reflects a starting point of just shy of five and half (sic) years full time imprisonment. This starting point presumably reflects some amelioration on account of delay.

Where that starting point is derived is not apparent.

68If the Sentencing Judge discounted a further 5% for delay, remorse and rehabilitation the starting point would have been approximately 5 years and 9 months. If discounted by 10% the starting point would have been a little over 6 years. The latter seems to be the minimum discount likely because it embraced three matters.

69Because Ground 1 is made out it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the Applicant. On the assumption that 6 years imprisonment was the notional starting point I do not consider that that sentence is manifestly excessive. Even bearing in mind the Applicant's gambling addiction and favourable subjective circumstances this was a systematic fraud planned and perpetrated over a lengthy period of time involving a large amount of money. It was only possible because of the position of trust the Applicant enjoyed with Railcorp. It is difficult to see how such a sentence could not be said to be within the range of sentences that might have been imposed by the Sentencing Judge. 

70The Applicant already had a conviction for a number of offences involving frauds concerning more that $100,000 from CentreLink. Despite that conviction the Applicant does not appear to have done anything to deal with her addiction. The further frauds on the football club, although taking place after the RailCorp frauds, were at least relevant to questions of personal deterrence and retribution. 

71As noted earlier, the Sentencing Judge erred in not providing a further discount for assistance given and offered by the Applicant. That discount should have been 10%. The discount for delay, remorse and rehabilitation provided for by the Sentencing Judge has been assumed at 10%. I consider that that is an appropriate discount. With the discount for the early plea the sentence of 6 years should be discounted by 45% to produce an overall sentence of 3 years and 3 months. 

72The Sentencing Judge found special circumstances and was correct to do so. The Applicant's chances of rehabilitation were demonstrated to be good from the various reports tendered at the sentencing hearing. His Honour fixed the non-parole period at 62% of the overall sentence. It is appropriate to maintain that proportion on the re-sentencing. With slight rounding down the non-parole period is 2 years commencing 24 February 2012 and expiring 23 February 2014 with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months expiring 23 May 2015. I would not alter the indicative sentences. 

73It can be seen from the above discussion that assumptions have had to be made about the approach the Sentencing Judge took to the sentencing process. That has made the re-sentencing more difficult because care needed to be taken to avoid a higher notional starting point than the primary judge apparently employed. 

74There is a tension in the authorities about whether specific figures ought to be put on discounts for various factors that are taken into account on sentencing. Many of the authorities were discussed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. Cases in related areas include R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 and Kite v R [2009] NSWCCA 12 (remorse); Lewins v R [2007] NSWCA 189; (2007) 175 A Crim R 40 at [17], [19]-[20] (""Ellis"" discount).

75The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 23(4) requires the court to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed if no discount for assistance was given. The common law position was similar: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [51]. The Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 21E requires a discount for future assistance to be specified for Commonwealth offences. Thomson at [160] encourages the quantification for the plea of guilty. Recent authority in this Court points to a need to specify each discount separately: LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 at [44] - [46].

76In R v PPB [1999] NSWCCA 360 Kirby J (with the agreement of Simpson J) discussed a discount for assistance. He said at [29]:

It was said to be unnecessary to quantify the precise level of the discount (Regina v Gallagher, per Gleeson CJ at p 227), although that remark was made before the Crimes Act and the Criminal Appeals Act were amended. In 1992 s442B was introduced into the Crimes Act, and s5DA into the Criminal Appeals Act. I believe, in the light of these provisions, it is prudent for a sentencing judge to include the arithmetic by which he or she arrives at the appropriate sentence. When the starting point is not identified, and the discount not specified, a person who has provided assistance may be left with a sense of grievance.

(Section 442B was the predecessor to s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 5DA deals with Crown appeals where a person whose sentence was discounted for assistance fails to provide that assistance.)

77The dangers adverted to in SZ v R at [4] -[11], Lewins at [20]-[21] and R v MAK at [44] need to be heeded, and it must be remembered that sentencing is an intuitive process and a formulaic approach should ordinarily be avoided (Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624; Thomson at [56] ff), but unless either the discount for discrete matters (cf remorse or perhaps the ""Ellis"" discount) or the notional starting point is disclosed there will be difficulties for this Court in any re-sentencing process. This is particularly so where, as in this case, the Sentencing Judge has said that the Applicant was ""entitled to a further discount for the delay"". Further, in cases involving co-offenders challenges on the basis of parity may not be able to be easily resolved. 

78A reading of Wood CJ at CL's judgment in Blanco at [15] suggests that he was of the view that the primary judge in that case ought to have specified what the reduction was for the delay.

Conclusion

79I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Allow the appeal.

(3)Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Williams. In lieu impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 24 February 2012 and expiring 23 February 2014 with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months expiring 23 May 2015.

     Matter No IRC 6749 of 2003Sherif Mohamed and Reuben F Scarf (Retail) Pty LimitedApplication under S.84 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1996 
      
      DECISION 
       
       
      [2004] NSWIRComm 1113 
     Preliminary1 Mr Sherif Mohamed was employed as store manager by Reuben F Scarf (Retail) Pty Limited which conducts twelve retail stores in New South Wales selling men's clothing and employs approximately sixty persons in its operations. Mr Mohamed was employed at the Bankstown store. His services were summarily terminated on Tuesday, 11 November, 2003 for misconduct after four years of employment for the alleged theft of moneys for banking to the value of $1,170.00. Mr Mohamed denied that he had stolen the money and he subsequently lodged an application under Part 6, Unfair Dismissals, of Chapter 2, Employment [Ss.83 to 90] of the 1996 Industrial Relations Act. 2 The matter was set down by Registry staff for a conciliation and directions hearing on Thursday, 11 December, 2003 and a mention on Friday, 6 February, 2004. There was no appearance for Mr Mohamed at the mention on Friday, 6 February, 2004 and I adjourned the mention for Wednesday, 24 March, 2004. (In fact, Mr Russo, representing Mr Mohamed in the proceedings, did appear later on Friday, 6 February, 2004 and I informed him of the adjournment of the matter.) The police had been involved in this matter but on Wednesday, 24 March, 2004 I was informed that for ""...budgetary reasons..."", ie in the light of the amount of money involved in the alleged theft measured against the resources for the police, they would not be continuing with the matter which they regarded as only a ""...soft crime..."". 3 Conciliation failed to resolve the matter. I programmed it for arbitration which occurred on Monday, 25 October, 2004. It was originally intended that the hearing would proceed on Tuesday, 26 October, 2004 but that additional day was not required. Mr Russo represented Mr Mohamed in the hearing, calling him to give evidence. Ms Brus represented Reuben F Scarf in the hearing. She called three witnesses to give evidence in the hearing - Mr Andrew Scarf, the general manager of Reuben F Scarf, and two tellers employed by Westpac Bank at its Bankstown Square Branch: Ms Maria Barounis and Ms Jannette Robles.4 Mr Mohamed's claim in his Part 6 application is confined to monetary compensation - six month's salary, ie the maximum amount of remuneration available in accordance with S.89(5). But Mr Mohamed's claim must be considered bearing in mind the provisions of S.89(6), viz: 
      
       
        
         
        ""When assessing any compensation payable, the Commission is to take into account whether the applicant made a reasonable attempt to find alternative employment and the remuneration that would have been payable if the applicant had succeeded in obtaining alternative employment."" 
         
         
        
       
      On Sunday, 23 November, 2003 Mr Mohamed had taken up work for another menswear store on a salary greater than that which he received when he was working for Reuben F Scarf. Indeed, Mr Mohamed had worked on a part-time basis for that menswear store during his period of employment with Reuben F Scarf. In doing so, it appears to me that he was acting contrary to directions in the policy and procedure manual which provides that: 
       
      
       
        
         
        ""...staff may not engage in outside employment with the competitors during the time of his employment..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed claimed in his evidence that the other menswear store was retailing a product for another market than that which Reuben F Scarf had directed its sales. But that may be a fine distinction which the policy and procedure manual was not contemplating. The fact remains that both Reuben F Scarf and the store with whom Mr Mohamed also worked were selling menswear.  
     5 In any event, as far as the assessment of monetary compensation is concerned, S.89(5) involves identifying loss of income by the dismissed employee, not an assessment of damages [Henderson v. Rural Lands Protection Board (1997) 74 IR 142 at p.50]. It is fairly settled law now in this State that such monetary compensation is neither punitive, punishing an employer for any wrongdoing on his part, nor designed to enrich the dismissed employee at the expense of his former employer. Because Mr Mohamed found alternative employment so soon after his dismissal, it must follow that the amount of monetary compensation to which he may become entitled is substantially reduced. 6 I accept that S.89(6) should not provide merely for a simple mathematical formula in the assessment of monetary compensation - a sum representing the amount of income over the period of six months immediately prior to the dismissal, compared and contrasted with the remuneration received in the alternative employment and considered against the length of time that an employee was out of work [D and R Commercial Pty Limited v. Flood (2002) 113 IR 344 at p.363]. Whilst S.89(5) does provide a clear jurisdictional limitation of the six month ceiling in S.89(5), the rest is a matter for my discretion. But in exercising that discretion, I am directed by S.89(6) to have regard to efforts made by a dismissed employee to mitigate his loss and the fact that Mr Mohamed had obtained employment, with a higher salary than he had formerly received when he was working for Reuben F Scarf, must serve to limit the amount of monetary compensation he may receive. (That is a matter which Ms Brus also suggested gave rise to an argument that his claim was really frivolous and vexatious and justified costs being ordered against him. I will discuss the question of costs later in this decision). 7 That brings me to the issue before me in this hearing. It is, of course, trite to say that the theft of money from an employer is a ground for his summary dismissal. But, in the light of Mr Mohamed's denial of the allegation against him, the onus of proof rests with Ms Brus to establish that he was guilty of the theft [Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees and Flour and Sugar Goods Workers Union v. Gartrell White (No.3) (1990) 35 IR 70 at pp.83 and 84]. The position was confirmed by the Full Bench of the Commission [Cahill J - Vice President, Hill J and French C) in Wang v. Crestell Industries Pty Limited (1997) 73 IR 454 at pp.463 and 464, viz: 
      
       
        
        ""…The onus of proof in such a case is on the employer and the standard of proof must be such as to enable a positive finding that the misconduct occurred. The standard is, of course, the civil and not the criminal one, but the requisite degree of satisfaction must have regard to the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the gravity of the consequences of the finding. The satisfaction must be such as to warrant a positive finding of the type referred to by the High Court of Australia in  
        M 
         v.  
        M 
         (1988) 63 ALJR 108 and by Dixon J in  
        Briginshaw 
         v.  
        Briginshaw 
         (1938) 60 CLR 336 at p.362…"" 
         
         
        
       
      The fact that the police are no longer considering laying charges against Mr Mohamed does not in any way resolve the issue before me. That would especially be the case since it has been suggested in the proceedings that the reason they have not laid charges against Mr Mohamed was not because they did not believe that Mr Mohamed did not have a case to answer on the basis of the criminal standard of proof - beyond reasonable doubt - but simply because of budgetary constraints on their resources to pursue the matter further.  
     The Evidence8 On Monday, 13 October, 2003 Mr Mohamed took money representing the store takings out of the safe at the back of the store, put it in a plastic bag, walked the short distance to the bank and placed it in the business express deposit box. It is Mr Mohamed's emphatic claim that there were three envelopes that he deposited in the deposit box at the bank - $934.00, representing the store takings for Friday, 10 October, 2003, $1,170.00, representing the store takings for Saturday, 11 October, 2003 and $793.45, representing the store takings for Sunday, 12 October, 2003. The envelope containing $1,170.00 has gone missing. On Friday, 7 November, 2003 the financial clerk employed by Reuben F Scarf approached Mr Scarf and told him that she had been informed by the bank that the store takings for Saturday, 11 October, 2003 had not been received by it. Mr Scarf raised the matter with Mr Mohamed over the telephone.9 Ms Barounis' duties at the bank include emptying the business express box and processing its contents. She does so always in the presence of another bank employee. In an affidavit which formed the basis of her evidence in this hearing she recorded the procedure she had adopted on Monday, 13 October, 2003, viz: 
      
       
        
        ""...I collected the deposits from the business deposit box with...Ms Robles in accordance with correct Westpac procedure. We then emptied the contents of the box into a basket. The collected amount of envelopes was first counted at this stage and recorded in a register and signed by both myself and Ms Robles. I then took the basket containing the business express deposits to my desk and entered the details into the computer. The details include the account numbers and the amount and the business express deposit number. I processed several Reuben F Scarf deposits on Monday, 13 October, 2003.  
         
         
        At the time of processing the deposits, I was not aware of which Reuben F Scarf store the particular deposits came from. When the bank received an inquiry regarding a missing deposit in early November, 2003, we were able to confirm that the amounts received and deposited from the Bankstown store were $934.00 and $793.45. Neither of the deposits I processed from the Bankstown store nor from any other Reuben F Scarf deposit was for the amount of $1,170.00."" 
         
         
        
       
      Ms Barounis had a key to the deposit box but only opens it in the presence of another bank officer. The manager of the bank also holds a key to the deposit box but to my mind it is simply not plausible that such a senior and responsible member of the bank staff may have accessed the box and taken the missing money as Mr  
      Russo 
       appears to me to have been suggesting in his cross-examinatin of Ms Barounis and Ms Robles.  
       
        
       
     10 Mr Scarf met with Mr Mohamed on Monday, 10 November, 2003. It is Mr Mohamed's claim in the affidavit that he provided as the basis for his evidence that he:  
      
       
        
        ""…had no idea what the meeting was about but I suspected something was going on..."" 
         
         
        
       
      I reject Mr Mohamed's claim in that respect. Mr Scarf had already spoken to Mr Mohamed over the telephone concerning the missing money and Mr Scarf asserted in his evidence that when he had again telephoned Mr Mohamed to arrange the meeting he spoke of the missing money, asked him if he would like a witness to be present in the meeting and, when Mr Mohamed did not respond, arranged for Mr Joe Karam, the area manager to attend the meeting as his witness.  
     11 Mr Scarf claimed that in the telephone conversation Mr Mohamed stated that: 
      
       
        
        ""I banked the money and nobody but the bank could possibly have the money."" 
         
         
        
       
      That is an assertion which Mr Mohamed continued to make during the meeting, even when Mr Scarf suggested to him the possibility that he may have dropped the missing money on the way to the bank, viz: 
      
      
       
        
        ""I could not have dropped it because of the way I was carrying it."" 
         
         
        
       
     12 Mr Scarf had asked Mr Mohamed to outline the procedure he had followed on Monday, 13 October, 2003. Mr Mohamed's explanation to Mr Scarf, outlined in his affidavit, was as follows: 
      
       
        
        ""...On Monday, 13 October, 2003 I opened the store safe and got out three days banking, double checked that I had three days banking and went to the bank as usual..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Scarf recalled Mr Mohammed saying that for Saturday, 11 October, 2003: 
      
      
       
        
        ""I closed off the till, counted the cash, balanced the till, drew up a banking sheet, put the money in a sealed banking bag, then took it to the safe. I then turned the alarm off, the lights off and walked out. I pulled down the shutters at around 4.00pm."" 
         
         
        
       
      And for Monday, 13 October, 2003: 
       
      
       
        
        ""I opened the shutter, turned off the alarm, then turned on the lights. I then counted the Sunday takings, filled in the banking slips, counted the float. By about 9.30am Sunday's takings were in the safe. When I put the money in the safe, I saw the banking from Friday and Saturday in the safe."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed confirmed that no other person had access to the keys to the safe. He has no other explanation for the missing money. Mr Scarf wrote out minutes of the meeting. It was signed by Mr Scarf, Mr Mohamed and Mr Karam. 
     13 On Tuesday, 11 November, 2003 Mr Scarf had a further conversation with Mr Mohamed. Mr Scarf recalled Mr Mohamed summarising the position in the following manner: 
      
       
        
         
        ""It was either me or the bank. It wasn't me as I definitely remember taking the three days banking from the safe and taking them to the bank and placing them in the express slot... The bank stole the money and have set me up. The banks steal money."" 
         
         
        
       
      At a further meeting at midday Mr Scarf asked Mr Mohamed for a further explanation and Mr Mohamed reasserted that ""...there were only two possibilities - me or the bank..."". Mr Scarf formed the view that Mr Mohamed had stolen the money and summarily dismissed him. He asked Mr Mohamed to hand over the keys to the store and the safe, collect his personal belonging and leave. Mr Mohamed refused to hand over the keys and remained at the store. Mr Scarf claimed that Mr Mohamed threatened him, viz: 
       
      
       
        
        ""If I have to sell my home, I am going to fix you and your brother up in court."" 
         
         
        
       
      Mr Mohamed denied that he made any such threat. But Mr Scarf called the local police and two police officers attended the store, ordering Mr Mohamed to hand over the keys and leave the premises. Mr Mohamed complied but remained outside the store. Mr Scarf asked the police officers to direct Mr Mohamed not to enter the store again. 
      Conclusion 14 Mr Mohamed has consistently argued that the missing money is the responsibility of the bank. His claim is that he did not steal the money and the only other alternative is that bank officers have done so. He sees the issue in purely black and white terms in that respect. However, in this hearing, I do not believe that I am strictly bound to those two alternatives. Notwithstanding Mr Mohamed's claim that the ""...bank has stolen the money..."", I have looked for another explanation for the missing money, eg that it was dropped in the street. Ultimately, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Mohamed is correct in that assertion at least - the money has been taken either by him or bank officers and there are really no other options. It is apparently only a short distance that he travelled from the store to the bank. The deposit box is inside the bank and if it were dropped on the floor it would have been seen there by bank staff. Mr Mohamed is emphatic that he deposited the money in the deposit box at the bank. 15 Mr Mohamed had total control of the money from the time it was allegedly placed by him in the safe until he deposited it in the deposit box at the bank. Indeed, no other person has seen the missing money from the time Mr Mohamed claims that he placed it in the safe. I do not believe that the procedure which has been adopted by the bank for the processing of deposits placed in the deposit box would permit an error or theft to have occurred at that end. Ms Barounis and Ms Robles provide complimentary evidence in this hearing of the action that was taken by them. By comparison, Mr Mohamed's version of events is totally uncorroborated. 16 I therefore reject Mr Mohamed's version of the incident. I am satisfied, according to the standard of proof required of Ms Brus in accordance with the reasoning in Wang v. Crestell Industries Pty Limited - the civil standard on the balance of probabilities - that Mr Mohamed was entirely responsible for the missing money at all material times and the fact that it has gone missing must mean that he stole it. I therefore see no justification for my intervention in support of him and dismiss his Part 6 application.17 However, I also reject Ms Brus' application for costs against him. Costs in Part 6 proceedings are governed by S.181(2)(c), viz: 
      
       
        
        ""...the Commission may award costs against a party to proceedings under Part 6 of Chapter 2 (Unfair dismissals), who, in the opinion of the Commission, unreasonably failed to agree to a settlement of the claim or whose application was frivolous or vexatious..."" 
         
         
        
       
      Ms  
      Brus 
       has argued that Mr Mohamed's Part 6 application was vexatious because (i) the short period of time before he found comparable alternative employment would confine his claim to a modest amount only and (ii) the threat that Mr Scarf alleges he made - ""...I am going to fix you and your brother up in court..."" (but which Mr Mohamed denies) reveals his real motive for pursuing his Part 6 application. 
      18 A frivolous or vexatious action is one where the party bringing it is not acting in good faith and merely seeks to annoy or embarrass an opponent or which is not designed to produce any practical result of benefit to him. In order to bring a case within the description of frivolous or vexatious it is not sufficient merely to say that the applicant has no cause of action. It must appear that the cause of action is, on the face of it, clearly one which no reasonable person could properly treat as bona fide and contend that he has a grievance which he was entitled to bring before the court. A frivolous or vexatious claim is, to use the language of Barwick CJ of the High Court in General Steel Industries Inc v. Commissioner for Railways (1964) 112 CLR 125 at p.129: 
      
       
        
        ""…so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed; manifestly groundless; so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument; discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed; under no possibility can there be a good cause of action; so manifest that to allow them (the pleadings) to stand would involve useless expense…"" 
        
       
      
      
      Whilst I am satisfied that Mr Mohamed's Part 6 application had no merit, my assessment has been made on the basis of the balance of probability. I do not hold myself up as infallible in my assessments and my conclusion that Mr Mohamed stole the missing money on the basis of that civil standard does not, in my view, support a claim that he is precluded from mounting a claim under Part 6. Consequently, I do not consider that he was acting frivolously or vexatiously in pursuing his claim under Part 6. He has every right to exercise the rights he has in that respect.

14921,6061339,"R v Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi & Jamil Qaumi (Sentence) [2017] NSWSC 774","Judgment


	
	Three brothers, Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi, stand for sentence in relation to a number of offences arising out of their involvement in the activities of a criminal organisation known as the Brothers for Life at Blacktown (BFL Blacktown). A jury determined the guilt of the offenders in relation to most of the offences following a trial that proceeded between April and November 2016. The jury returned its verdicts on 8 November 2016 and was discharged when it was unable to agree, or reach a majority verdict, in relation to a number of offences charged against two co-accused (MK and MZ) [1]  and one offence in relation to Mumtaz Qaumi. The jury trial was largely concerned with five shooting incidents that took place between 28 October and 28 November 2013. One person was killed, several others injured and the lives of at least 10 people placed in jeopardy. These five shootings occurred in the context of differences between the BFL Blacktown, led by Farhad Qaumi, and a rival group called the Brothers for Life at Bankstown (BFL Bankstown), led by Mohammed Hamzy. In addition to the offences arising out of the shootings, the offenders were also convicted of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs, participating in a criminal group by directing its activities, and possession of the firearms that were used in the shootings. In the course of the jury trial, Jamil Qaumi pleaded guilty to three counts of contempt and Mumtaz Qaumi pleaded guilty to one count of contempt. The most serious offence, the murder of Joseph Antoun by Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi on 16 December 2013, was subject to a separate Judge alone trial. [2]  That trial came to a conclusion on 28 February 2017. [3] 
	
	
	At times in the course of this judgment, for convenience and while intending no disrespect, I will refer to the offenders by their first names.
	


THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES


	
	I will set out the facts of the offences in chronological order. These factual findings are made to the criminal standard of proof, guided by and consistent with the verdicts of the jury and based on the evidence adduced in the course of the two trials.
	


The Hamzy Shooting at Revesby Heights on 29 October 2013


	
	The first shooting incident took place at Revesby Heights on 29 October 2013. Each of the offenders was convicted of conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy (count 3), the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy (an alternative to count 1 charging murder) and causing grievous bodily harm to Omar Ajaj with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (count 2).
	
	
	On the afternoon of the shooting, Farhad received information from Witness M that Mohammed Hamzy intended to kill him. Farhad then asked Witness M to repeat the allegation to several other members of the group. There was conflict between the witnesses as to precisely what was said and I am certain that Witness M understated what she told the group. I accept, and the jury must have accepted, that the offenders were told that Mohammed Hamzy made an earlier, foiled, attempt to execute Farhad Qaumi and then took out a contract on his (Farhad’s) life. While I accept that there was pre-existing rivalry between the two chapters of the Brothers For Life, the idea of killing Mohammed Hamzy arose because of the information provided by Witness M on the afternoon of 29 October 2013. There is no evidence upon which I am prepared to act to suggest that the plot to kill the rival gang leader was formulated, or even contemplated, before the day of the shooting.
	
	
	There were a number of meetings over the next few hours and a conspiracy was entered between the three offenders and a number of other members of the BFL Blacktown to murder Mohammed Hamzy that night. The jury’s verdicts establish that the offenders believed this action was necessary to defend Farhad Qaumi from Hamzy’s plan to kill him. The verdicts also show that the jury found beyond reasonable doubt that this was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as the offenders perceived them.
	
	
	Three handguns were obtained and members were assigned different tasks. Witness M offered to be the driver when another member was reluctant to undertake that role. Witness M knew the address and the time that Hamzy was required to be home under a court-imposed curfew. Witness M played an active role in the events as they unfolded. Jamil Qaumi, Witness L and a third member of the group were provided with the handguns. There were two 0.38 calibre revolvers and a 0.45 calibre pistol. Each of those guns was discharged in the course of the incident. There was controversy as to the identity of the third shooter (who used what I will describe as the second 0.38 calibre revolver). For the purpose of sentencing the three offenders, it is unnecessary to make a finding as to the third shooter’s identity. The jury was unable to reach agreement in the case of a co-accused who the prosecution asserts is the third shooter. This co-accused will be re-tried later this year and it is undesirable to make any further comment as to the problems confronting the prosecution in establishing his identity beyond reasonable doubt. There was also a dispute as to whether it was Witness L or Jamil Qaumi who carried and used the first 0.38 calibre revolver. The significance of that dispute is that the first 0.38 revolver was the gun that was used to shoot Mahmoud Hamzy three times in the head at relatively close range. These were the shots that killed him.
	
	
	Witness M drove the three shooters to the Hamzy residence. There were a number of people, including Mohammed Hamzy’s wife, present in the house. The information provided by Witness M was that Mohammed Hamzy would be in the garage. Before they set out, Farhad provided the shooters with a description of the target. That description was dangerously vague and based, in part, on the clothing Hamzy was wearing earlier in the day. The three shooters entered the garage. Four men were present. Jamil Qaumi and Witness L opened fire on two of them while the other two, including Mohammed Hamzy, escaped through a door into the house. Omar Ajaj received serious injuries from two gunshot wounds. The target’s cousin, Mahmoud Hamzy, received multiple gunshot wounds from the 0.45 calibre pistol and a 0.38 revolver. This included the three head shots fired from close range from the first 0.38 calibre revolver. The shooters mistakenly believed this was Mohammed Hamzy because, amongst other things, he was wearing a cap consistent with the description provided by Farhad before they set out. The shooters ran from the garage and, as they departed, the third shooter fired into the garage causing damage to a wall. Witness M drove the three shooters from the scene.
	
	
	Meanwhile, Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi travelled to the Coolibah Hotel in Merrylands. There is CCTV footage of them playing the poker machines there and interacting with a doorman. This was calculated to distance themselves from the shooting and to establish an alibi. There is CCTV footage of Witness L arriving at the hotel after the shooting and evidence of him trying to locate Farhad and Mumtaz after the shooting.
	
	
	I am unable to resolve the question of whether Witness L or Jamil Qaumi fired the headshots that killed Mahmoud Hamzy. [4]  Witness L gave evidence that he had the 0.45 calibre pistol and gave graphic evidence of Jamil Qaumi firing the 0.38 calibre revolver at the head of Mahmoud Hamzy while the victim was lying helpless on the ground. Witness J gave evidence that he saw Farhad Qaumi hand the 0.45 pistol to Witness L. That evidence supports the Crown case that it was Jamil Qaumi who fired the headshots. On the other hand, Jamil Qaumi gave evidence that the headshots were fired by Witness L. Witness L’s evidence of the number of bullets in the gun was more consistent with it being the 0.38 revolver. The evidence of the position of the shooters within the garage, and the CCTV footage of the order in which the three men entered and left the garage, also creates a doubt about Witness L’s evidence. The jury’s verdicts do not resolve this question. If the matter were to be resolved on the balance of probabilities, I would act on the combination of the evidence of Witness L and Witness J. However, because the matter may aggravate the objective criminality of Jamil Qaumi, and also be used against him on the question of future dangerousness, it is an issue upon which the criminal standard of proof applies. [5]  I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Jamil Qaumi fired the 0.38 revolver at the head of Mahmoud Hamzy. In view of the evidence of the respective capacity of the two guns and the number of bullets fired, along with the position of the three men at critical times, I am not prepared to act on this part of the evidence of Witness L even though it receives some inferential support from Witness J.
	
	
	The Crown case against each accused was based on the existence and execution of a joint criminal enterprise. Accordingly, precisely who fired each shot, who carried which gun and the exact role of each offender is not as significant than would be the case if Jamil Qaumi was charged simply as a principal in the first degree. The fact is that each participant entered into a criminal agreement to kill Mohammed Hamzy and that Witness L and Jamil Qaumi shot at Mahmoud Hamzy with an intention to kill him. Each participant is criminally responsible for the act of the man who fired the fatal shots.
	
	
	The impact of this crime on the victims was horrendous. There was medical evidence of the injuries suffered by Omar Ajaj and Mahmoud’s sister, Hassnah Hamzy, provided a victim’s impact statement. [6] 
	
	
	The facts of the Hamzy shooting constitute criminality of a very high order. The shooting was premeditated and reasonably well planned, even though the wrong man was shot and the planning and premeditation took place over a number of hours (not days or weeks). It was carried out in a suburban home where the conspirators and principals did not know who might be present but did know, or ought to have known, that people other than the intended target would be put in danger. It involved the use of three handguns that the offenders were able to obtain quickly. It was part of an ongoing and organised criminal enterprise undertaken in a violent gangland setting. I do not accept the Crown’s submission that the motive for these crimes was to execute and eliminate a rival gang member although that would have been the fortuitous consequence (from the offenders’ perspective) had the correct target been killed. That submission was based almost entirely on the evidence of Witness M, whose evidence I am unable to accept on critical issues unless it is supported by other evidence.
	
	
	The shooting was carried out because of a genuine belief in each of the offenders that it was necessary to kill Mohammed Hamzy in order to protect Farhad Qaumi’s life. That is the only possible basis upon which the jury could have acquitted each accused of the murder charge. The jury’s verdict on the three charges shows that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s conduct was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as each of them perceived them. I am bound by that finding but, in any event, I am also satisfied of that fact beyond any reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In the aftermath of the Hamzy shooting, members of the BFL Blacktown were concerned that the BFL Bankstown may seek retribution. It was in that context that the next three shooting offences occurred over the following week or so. Luckily – nobody else was killed but an innocent teenage girl suffered awful injuries, three men received gunshot wounds and a number of lives were placed in peril.
	


Offences to be taken into account in Jamil Qaumi’s case


	
	Jamil Qaumi has asked that three offences be taken into account in sentencing him for the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy. These offences were part of one criminal escapade committed on 14 October 2013. The offences are (1) specially aggravated break and enter (the circumstance of special aggravation being the use of a pistol), (2) using a pistol without a licence and (3) demanding property with menaces. The facts of the offences are set out in Ex S-G and involve Jamil attending residential premises with a number of other gang members and attempting to extort money from a person who was trying to buy a car from an associate (Witness E). A gun was discharged by Witness L who shot a dog. When the initial plan failed, an attempt was made to extort Witness E by having him give the car to the gang members.
	
	
	The offences to be taken into account are serious offences. Standing alone they would warrant the imposition of a substantial custodial sentence. However, because they are dealt with under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, they will not be subject to any separate sentence and it is incorrect to consider what sentence may have been imposed and increase the current sentence by that measure or by some notional amount. However, the procedure means that the weight to be given to retribution and personal (or specific) deterrence will be greater in sentencing Jamil Qaumi for the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy. [7]  The sentence for the manslaughter offence will inevitably be longer because those offences are taken into account. However, it will not be nearly as long as if the charges were the subject of separate sentences.
	


The Shooting of Michael Odisho on 3 November 2013


	
	There were a number of meetings after the Hamzy shooting and, on 2 November 2013, members of the BFL Blacktown, including the three offenders, attended the Star City Casino. Farhad Qaumi spoke with two members of the BFL Bankstown and (it seems) learned that the rival gang suspected or believed that Farhad and the BFL Blacktown were responsible for the Hamzy shooting. There was a great controversy in the trial as to whether there was a further meeting of a smaller group of members after the group left the casino. I am satisfied there was such a meeting. This finding is based on the testimony of Witness L and the support it receives from telephone cell tower records that place, at least generally, the telephones of relevant participants in the area of Woolloomooloo or the area of the Domain near Mrs Macquarie’s chair and the Royal Botanic Garden. Other telephone records, and a police stop, show that Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi did not travel home to the central coast for some hours after leaving the casino. The finding is also consistent with the jury verdicts. At this meeting Farhad Qaumi identified a number of members of the BFL Bankstown who were to be targeted for assassination. This included Michael Odisho and Masood Zakaria, two of Mohammed Hamzy’s trusted lieutenants. The jury’s verdicts suggest that it was also satisfied that this meeting took place.
	
	
	On the evening of 3 November 2013, Michael Odisho was shot in his home in the presence of his mother. The jury found the three offenders guilty of soliciting the murder of Odisho (count 4) and attempting (shooting with intent) to murder him (count 5).
	
	
	The evidence established that Witness C was the driver and the shooters were Witness I (armed with a revolver) and Witness D (armed with a shotgun). When Odisho came to the front door of the house, both men opened fire upon him. The ballistic and forensic examination suggests that around 7 shots were fired. Odisho received serious injuries comprised of gunshot wounds to his left elbow, left thigh and the back of his left leg. These required surgical intervention.
	
	
	The jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders solicited other members of the gang to carry out this attempted murder. The jury must have rejected various assertions made by, or on behalf, of the offenders in the course of the trial. These included that Farhad was not involved at all, that the plan was formulated by Witnesses L and I who feared that they were being blamed for the Hamzy shooting, and that the plan involved no more than shooting at Odisho’s house as a warning. The jury also rejected the suggestion that the act was carried out as some kind of pre-emptive self-defence.
	
	
	These two offences are serious offences of their kind. They were planned and pre-meditated. They involved gangland violence, the use of guns and were carried out in the victim’s home. Judging from his appearance and performance on a current affairs programme, discussed in an earlier judgment, [8]  Mr Odisho appears to have recovered well from his injuries. He refused to appear at the trial, threatening to disrupt the proceedings if he was compelled and, as I understand it, is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment. The fact that the victim was another gang member, and apparently quite a disreputable fellow, does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence.
	


The Zakaria Shooting on 4 November 2013


	
	The next night, 4 November 2013, there was a shooting at the Zakaria home in Blacktown. The target of the shooting was Masood Zakaria but a teenage girl (H) was shot when MK discharged a shotgun into the home. Once again, Witness C was the driver. Witness D was directed to lure Masood out of the house because he knew him. MK and Witness I were designated to be the shooters.
	
	
	The jury found Farhad and Jamil Qaumi guilty of soliciting the murder of Masood Zakaria (count 7), not guilty of attempted murder (count 8) but guilty of the alternative count of causing grievous bodily harm to H with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (count 9). The jury was unable to agree upon its verdict for Mumtaz Qaumi on count 7, found him not guilty of count 8 but guilty of count 9.
	
	
	The verdicts in respect of the charges arising out of the Zakaria shooting demonstrated the jury’s careful discernment between the counts and the cases made against each accused. The evidence of what (if anything) Mumtaz Qaumi said and did around the Zakaria shooting was inconsistent and weak. Further, the jury asked a question in the course of its deliberation as to whether the Crown relied on joint criminal enterprise in respect of the charge of solicit to murder Masood Zakaria. The answer to that question was “no”. [9]  Accordingly, the jury accepted that Mumtaz was a party to the joint criminal enterprise but did not accept that he directly solicited the shooters to kill Masood Zakaria. These findings, and the consequent verdicts, were consistent with the quality of the evidence tendered against Mumtaz Qaumi.
	
	
	The jury acquitted MK of count 8 and could not agree on a verdict for MK on count 9. His case involved two different propositions. The first was that when he discharged the firearm, he did not have the specific intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The second was that he was acting under duress. MK’s acquittal on count 8 suggests that the jury were not satisfied that he formed the intention to kill at the time he discharged the shotgun or had a reasonable doubt about the issue of duress. The failure to reach a verdict on count 9 for MK, considered with the conviction of Farhad and Jamil Qaumi of that count, suggests that the jury was divided on the issue of duress in MK’s case. The Crown case against the offenders on count 8 was based on joint criminal enterprise. It was required to prove that the shooter (MK) carried out the shooting with intent to kill. The acquittals on count 8 suggest that the jury had a doubt about this.
	
	
	Consistent with the jury’s verdicts, the evidence established that Farhad identified Masood Zakaria as a target in the meeting that occurred after the visit to the Star City Casino on 2 November 2013. On the day of the shooting Farhad and Jamil Qaumi gave directions to MK and Witnesses C, D and I as to how the shooting was to be carried out. They provided the shooters with the guns that were to be used. Mumtaz Qaumi was present and participating in the enterprise but did not give any instructions to those directed to carry out the shooting. There was evidence that Farhad was angry at the failed attempt on Odisho’s life the night before, saying something to the effect of “How hard is it to shoot somebody?”
	
	
	In compliance with those directions, Witness C drove the other three men to the Zakaria residence and Witness D attempted to lure Zakaria out of the house. MK then opened fire with a shotgun. Witness I, armed with a revolver, did not fire his weapon. That was his evidence and it was supported by the absence of forensic or ballistic evidence that a revolver was discharged. All of the damage to the house, and H’s injuries, were consistent with the use of a shotgun. This part of the evidence provided support for the Crown’s submission that the jury should reject the defence case that the Zakaria shooting was the brainchild of Witness I. Witness C drove the other three men from the scene and they made their escape.
	
	
	The jury rejected the defence case that Witness I and others were the instigators of this shooting or that the only plan of which the offenders were aware involved shooting at the house as a warning.
	
	
	H was left with devastating injuries. A large number of shotgun pellets could not be removed from her body and she has elevated lead levels as a result. Her capacity to become pregnant, and to carry a baby to full term, has been compromised.
	
	
	These offences are extremely serious. They formed part of an ongoing criminal enterprise being played out in a gangland setting and involved the premeditated and reasonably well-planned employment of violence. The offences involved the use of guns, took place in the victim’s home and demonstrated an utter disregard for the safety of those in the vicinity. The impact on the primary victim, an innocent teenage child, is horrific.
	


The Chokolatta Café Shooting on 7 November 2017


	
	On 7 November 2013 the spate of shootings continued. This shooting took place outside of the Chokolatta Café in Bankstown. The target was a man called Abdul Abu-Mahmoud. He was targeted while sitting in a car outside the café with two other men. Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi were found guilty of soliciting the murder of Mr Abu-Mahmoud (count 10) and three counts of shoot with intent to murder (counts 11, 13 and 15). There was no evidence that Farhad Qaumi was complicit in these offences and, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, I directed the jury to find him not guilty of counts 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. [10] 
	
	
	The motive for this shooting was bizarre. There was no evidence that Farhad Qaumi nominated Abu-Mahmoud as a target and, according to Witness M, specifically ruled him out. Farhad Qaumi left Australia shortly after the Zakaria shooting leaving Mumtaz Qaumi in charge. Mr Abu-Mahmoud was not a member of the BFL Bankstown but was believed to have some association with members of that group. Mumtaz was concerned that he may have access to the addresses of the leaders of the BFL Blacktown and might provide those addresses to the BFL Bankstown. Accordingly, he formulated a harebrained plan to kill Abu-Mahmoud.
	
	
	There was evidence that Witness M and others attended the Chokolatta Café on the early evening of the shooting so that M could identify Abu-Mahmoud to those engaged to carry out the shooting. There were telephone intercepts in which Jamil Qaumi gave various directions to Witness I and text exchanges between Jamil and Witness M. [11]  Meanwhile, Mumtaz Qaumi travelled from his home on the central coast to Sydney. While Mumtaz’s attendance on the earlier visit to the café could not be sustained on the cell tower evidence of his movements, the jury accepted that he and Jamil solicited the murder of Abu-Mahmoud.
	
	
	Ultimately, the offenders directed Witness I to drive the shooters to the restaurant at around closing time and to block Abu-Mahmoud’s car when the target left the café. As it happened, Abu-Mahmoud got into his car along with two other men and all three men were sitting in the car when the shooting occurred. Witness I blocked the car and MK (armed with a 0.38 calibre revolver) and Witness D (armed with a shotgun) opened fire on and into the car. Two of the occupants received gunshot wounds although both were expected to make a full recovery. The ballistics evidence showed that projectiles fired from the shotgun struck the top of the back of the driver’s seat. It was dumb luck that the projectile did not enter the back of the head and kill Mr Khalil who was sitting there. The ballistics evidence supported MK’s case that he fired the revolver into the side of the car and not at the three victims sitting inside the car.
	
	
	The jury was unable to agree upon verdicts in respect of MK on the counts arising out of the Chokolatta Café shooting. It may be that some members of the jury doubted whether he had the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm or whether duress had been negatived beyond reasonable doubt. Resolution of those matters, which involve a degree of speculation, is not necessary to understand the guilty verdicts reached in relation to Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi. There was no doubt that at least one of the shooters (Witness D) fired his weapon with intention to kill.
	
	
	The offences arising out of the Chokolatta Café shooting are obviously extremely serious. They involved a plot to take the life of one man, endangered the lives of three men directly and were carried out in a public place with no regard for the safety of the public. They constituted a continuation of a violent, underworld rampage in which a number of guns were readily accessed and discharged in or near people’s homes and public places.
	


The Greenacre shooting on 28 November 2013


	
	On 28 November 2013, Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi directed Witnesses L and M to carry out what was described as a “drive-by” shooting at premises in Greenacre. Witness L was provided with a 0.45 calibre pistol for this purpose. The plan was to shoot at the house occupied by the mother of Mohammed Hamzy. However, when they arrived at the scene, Witness L was concerned because there were women and children in the vicinity of Mrs Hamzy’s home. He returned to the car, where Witness M told Witness L that a group of men nearby were members of the Bankstown BFL and suggested that Witness L shoot at them. Witness L did this by firing the gun around five or six times. One of the bullets struck Anthony Elkadi and another struck a dwelling.
	
	
	Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi were found guilty of an offence of firing at a dwelling house in the course of criminal activity with reckless disregard for safety (count 18). The offenders did not intend that any person be shot and they are not to be sentenced for the injury suffered by Mr Elkadi.
	
	
	This offence was part of the gangland war being fought between the two chapters of the Brothers For Life. It was part of an ongoing and organised criminal activity. It involved the use of a firearm in a public place and directed at private home. The danger to innocent bystanders was obvious and the offence was committed with disregard for public safety. While this was the least serious of the convictions for shooting offences, it remains an extremely serious offence of its kind.
	


Guns, drugs and criminal group


	
	In addition to the offences arising out of the five shootings directed at the members and associates of the BFL Bankstown, the jury also found the offenders guilty of possession of some of the firearms used in those offences. Farhad Qaumi was convicted of possessing a 0.45 calibre pistol (count 19). That pistol was never recovered but ballistics evidence suggested that the same 0.45 calibre pistol was used in the Hamzy shooting as well as the “drive-by” shooting at Greenacre (count 18). [12]  All three offenders were convicted of possessing a prohibited firearm (a Mossberg sawn-off pump action shotgun) (count 21) and possessing a pistol (a Smith & Wesson 0.38 calibre revolver) (count 22). Those two guns were located in a bag that also contained drugs. There was a deal of evidence in the trial of attempts by the offenders to recover this bag in the latter part of 2013. The Mossberg shotgun was used in the Zakaria shooting. The Smith & Wesson revolver was used in the Hamzy shooting.
	
	
	The three offenders were also convicted of the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (count 20). The evidence suggested that one of the core businesses of the BFL Blacktown was the supply of various drugs. The offenders are not to be sentenced for those activities. However, there was evidence of their involvement in the possession of a bag that contained the two guns subject of counts 21 and 22 along with a quantity of tablets containing a drug called N-(2-methoxylbenzl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine. The quantity of drugs in the bag was 1,894.4 grams. The large commercial quantity prescribed for this drug in the Schedule to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) is 2 grams. An expert certificate was tendered on sentence. [13]  It established that the drug is a “relatively new psychoactive substance” and that there is a lack of comprehensive data on its effects. It has hallucinogenic effects similar to LSD and can cause severe agitation and confusion, severe psychological and behavioural changes, aggression and unpredictable violent episodes.
	
	
	The three offenders were also convicted of directing the activities of a criminal group (count 23). This is the aggravated form of the offence provided for in s 93T(1A) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The particulars of the activities of the group provided by the prosecution in relation to this count were the same activities covered by the offences in the indictment. In sentencing for most of the individual offences, one of the aggravating features is the fact that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity. In those circumstances the only appropriate exercise of discretion is to make the sentence for the criminal group charge either wholly or largely concurrent with the other sentences. Because of his unquestioned leadership role, the objective criminality of Farhad Qaumi is far greater than the other offenders in relation to this offence. Even when Mumtaz Qaumi was placed in charge, he was clearly motivated to do Farhad’s bidding.
	


The contract killing of Joseph Antoun on 16 December 2013


	
	After a trial by Judge alone, Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi were convicted of the murder of Joseph Antoun on 16 December 2013. The facts are set out in some detail in my judgment explaining the reasons for finding each offender guilty. [14] 
	
	
	The two offenders accepted a contract from Les Elias to organise the murder of Mr Antoun. They were paid at least $80,000, and possibly $100,000, to do this. It may be that they were promised $190,000 and that some of the money remains outstanding. The precise terms of the contract were unknowable due to the coded communications surrounding the transaction, the use of other business transactions to hide the true reason for the transfer of money and the predictable absence of evidence from those involved in organising the contract.
	
	
	The two accused approached Witness L who had carried out two previous shootings on their behalf – the Hamzy shooting and the drive-by shooting at Greenacre. I am unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders threatened him and his daughter as Witness L alleged, but there is no doubt that the offenders engaged him to carry out the killing. On 11 December 2013, the offenders showed Witness L the house where Mr Antoun lived with his wife and two daughters and, on the day of the killing, they provided him with a 0.38 calibre snub nose revolver. The offenders offered to pay Witness L part of the proceeds of the contract but never did so.
	
	
	On the day of the murder, the offenders engaged Witness C to drive Witness L to the premises although they did not tell him the true purpose of the journey. After Witness L picked up the weapon from his home, Witness C drove Witness L to the residential premises of the victim. There is CCTV footage showing Witness L firing a number of shots at Mr Antoun who was standing at the front door. Teagan Mullens provided a chilling description of what she saw as the father of her twin daughters was executed in cold blood in her presence. At least one of the five bullets penetrated Mr Antoun’s heart and he died quickly at the scene. Witness L ran from the premises and Witness C, who heard the gunshots and was now aware of the true purpose of the trip, drove Witness L from the scene.
	
	
	After the shooting, Witness L showed the offenders where he had hidden the murder weapon and, after Witness L was arrested for breach of parole, Farhad Qaumi took steps to dispose of the gun. To this end, he used the services of Witness K, his young cousin and fellow BFL Blacktown member. Farhad was under surveillance at this time and Witness K was arrested shortly after he took possession of the gun. It was subsequently identified as the gun that killed Mr Antoun.
	
	
	In the days following the murder, there was further surveillance of the offenders. There were meetings with Elias and also a gangland figure called Pasquale Barbaro. Barbaro had previously expressed strong and adverse opinions of Mr Antoun and he may also have been involved in the plot to engage the Qaumi brothers.
	
	
	Teagan Mullens and the victim’s brother Nemer both gave evidence of the impact of the offence on the family of Mr Antoun. Short and moving letters written by Mr Antoun’s twin daughters were tendered and read by their mother. The impact on the family is unfathomable.
	
	
	The seriousness of this offence speaks for itself and raises the question whether the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met by the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. [15] 
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi was also convicted of possession of the 0.38 calibre snub nose revolver. This offence encompassed his control over the weapon when it was in the possession of others (Witnesses L and K) and for the short period in which he had actual custody of the weapon. There is no evidence Farhad owned the weapon and the most likely source of the weapon was Witness M who had family connections with access to guns and who was involved in the preparation for the shooting.
	


The contempt offences

Refusal to answer questions


	
	Jamil Qaumi gave evidence in the trial. On 23-24 August 2016, on four occasions, he refused to answer relevant questions in spite of being directed to do so. He was charged with contempt on each occasion although he was not required to enter a plea at that stage. [16]  Subsequently, the learned Crown Advocate appeared as amicus and the charges as originally formulated were amended. Two charges of contempt were substituted. The first charge covered two instances of refusing to answer questions on 23 August 2016 during evidence in chief. The second charge covered refusal to answer questions on 24 August 2016 in cross-examination. Jamil was invited to plead to these charges on 6 October 2016 and entered a plea of guilty to each charge.
	
	
	A peculiar aspect of the first charge is the fact that the question was asked in chief by the offender’s own counsel in circumstances where it was (or should have been) known that Jamil would refuse to answer the question. The question was not withdrawn and the offender was directed to answer it. He refused. After a brief adjournment allowing counsel to advise their client, the offender was given the opportunity to answer the question and purge his contempt. He refused again after being directed to answer. The following day, the Crown Prosecutor asked similar questions and twice the offender refused to answer in spite of being directed to do so.
	
	
	All four refusals to answer came in response to what was, essentially, the same question. That question was this: who was the third shooter in the Hamzy shooting. This was a critical piece of information to both the Crown and the man accused by the Crown. By refusing to answer this question, Jamil Qaumi acted with flagrant disregard to the interests of justice and the interests of the parties. At worst, he may have denied an innocent man the opportunity to establish his defence.
	
	
	On the other hand, I accept that part of Jamil’s Qaumi’s evidence when he said:
	


“Well, if I answer that question everyone’s going to call me a dog. I’m in gaol and my life’s going to be in danger in gaol.” [17] 


	
	He later said:
	


“Yeah, I am very sorry, your Honour, but I can’t answer that question. I am in gaol. My life is going to be in danger if I answer that question.” [18] 


	
	I accept that this is the true explanation for the offender’s refusal to answer the questions and, while they do not purge the contempt or justify it, they provide a proper context and a degree of mitigation.
	


Assaulting a co-accused in the dock


	
	On 14 October 2016 Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi each pleaded guilty to one count of contempt arising out of an act of violence upon their co-accused (MK) that was committed in my presence and while the Court was sitting in the absence of the jury. The incident took place on 1 August 2016.
	
	
	The facts of the incident are described in my judgment R v Qaumi and Ors (No 55) [19]  and the background to the incident is set out at [4]–[10] of that judgment. The incident was captured on CCTV installed in the courtroom and this footage was tendered in the course of the sentencing proceedings. [20]  However graphic that footage is, it does not capture the full extent of the brief but violent confrontation. Members of my staff and others present in court were greatly shaken by the incident.
	
	
	Nothing in the background to the incident justified what appeared to be a calculated attempt to injure and intimidate a co-accused. The timing of the incident, which occurred almost instantly upon the door behind the jury being closed, suggests that offenders planned the attack in advance. Farhad Qaumi’s reaction suggested that he was unaware of the plan. Following the incident, both MK and the other co-accused sought to be removed from the dock asserting that they felt unsafe in the face of such violence. Ultimately, a Perspex [21]  wall was constructed within the dock separating the three offenders from their co-accused. The Court was unable to sit while the wall was constructed and the jury was asked to disperse for a number of days.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept that the pressure of the extremely long trial and the stress and anxiety caused by the proceedings, played a part in causing the accused to conduct themselves as they did. As I commented more than once over the 18 months of the trial, the conduct of the accused was, on the whole, very good in spite of those pressures and anxieties. Even allowing for these pressures, the behaviour constituted a serious contempt of the Court.
	


The attitude of Courts to gangland violence


	
	All of the offences arose because the offenders were the leaders (or, in Jamil’s, case the brother of the leaders) of a criminal gang that acquired a reputation for violence and indulged in a “war” with a rival criminal gang. When he gave evidence on the issue of his conditions of incarceration, Farhad Qaumi said:
	


“They tried to kill me.

…

I mean, it’s not a secret, I’m at war. That’s what the proceedings is about here. There’s casualties in war.” [22] 


	
	It is worth noting that a number of the casualties in this so called “war” were completely innocent victims caught in the cross-fire. Examples are Mahmoud Hamzy (who is dead), the child H (who may never be able to fall pregnant) and the people shot outside the Chokolatta Café.
	
	
	While the Antoun murder was not part of this “war”, I draw the inference that Farhad Qaumi was approached to organise the killing because of the reputation for violence he had earned in the criminal underworld and his capacity to direct others to carry out murderous acts of gun violence.
	
	
	In cases involving a sustained, even if relatively brief, course of conduct involving gangland violence, the Courts have made it clear that the conduct cannot be tolerated and must be met with punishment that denounces the crime and deters others from acting in a similar way. It is unnecessary to recount cases in which such statements have been made.
	


the charges and applicable penalties


	
	Farhad Qaumi is to be sentenced for 15 offences. Table A at the end of this judgment sets out those offences, along with the applicable maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods. He faces two offences carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, [23]  seven offences carrying 25 years and a number of other offences carrying 14 years or more. The offences attract standard non-parole periods of 20 years, 15 years, 10 years (4), 7 years (3) and four years (4).
	
	
	Mumtaz Qaumi is to be sentenced for 17 offences. Table B sets out the offences, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods. This includes the murder which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and standard non-parole period of 20 years. There are nine offences carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years and seven attracting a standard non-parole period of 10 years. All of the offences are serious.
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi is to be sentenced for 18 offences. Table C sets out the details and applicable penalties. The drug offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment although that is one of the less serious offences he faces. There are eleven offences carrying a maximum penalty of twenty five years and other offences carrying a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	One only has to state those maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods to realise the situation of each of these offenders is dire.
	
	
	In sentencing the offenders, I must always keep in mind the maximum penalties prescribed by the Parliament (or the common law in the case of the contempt charges) and consider any relevant standard non-parole periods as guideposts to the relative seriousness with which the law treats the various offences. In many cases, the Crown has submitted that the maximum penalty should be imposed. The High Court indicated recently that a sentencing Judge should avoid expressing an opinion that a particular offence is “in the worst category of offence”. [24]  Rather, an assessment is to be made whether it is appropriate to impose the maximum penalty and to explain the reasons for that conclusion. That conclusion is based ultimately on a consideration of the seriousness of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	The standard non-parole period applies to an offence falling in the middle range of objective seriousness and the correct approach to the standard non-parole period has been explained in a number of cases, most authoritatively by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen. [25]  While it is an important legislative yardstick to the appropriate sentence, the standard non-parole period does not replace the judicial task of synthesising all of the many factors that are relevant to sentencing and instinctively determining the weight that should be given to those factors in deciding on a proper and appropriate sentence. [26]  Whether an offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness is to be assessed “without reference to matters personal to the particular offender or class of offenders”. [27] 
	


the personal (OR SUBJECTIVE) cases


	
	The offenders are brothers and parts of their personal cases are similar. Each of them has lived a life of dislocation and trauma. Their family is from Afghanistan and was forced to flee that country as a result of the military conflict, civil war and internal disruptions and persecutions in which that country was mired in the 1980s and 1990s. Their father was psychologically scarred as a consequence and this impacted on the boys’ lives in various ways over many years. This background explains to some degree the paths that the offenders’ lives took and provides a context in which their offending behaviour is to be evaluated. Their involvement in crime and willingness to resort to violence, particularly gun violence, cannot be divorced from their personal histories and exposure to such violence (either directly or vicariously) in their formative years. It is difficult for those fortunate to grow up in a peaceful society, largely unaffected by war and terrorism, to understand the impact on those whose lives have been damaged or destroyed by the scourge of systematic violence, brutality and dislocation.
	


Farhad Qaumi


	
	Farhad Qaumi’s personal case was established through a report prepared by Dr Kerri Eagle, forensic psychiatrist. It received support from material tendered on behalf of Mumtaz Qaumi and in a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1998. [28]  He has a troubling criminal history of some significance in a determination of the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Farhad is 34 years old and has 3 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years. His marriage broke down when he was remanded in custody in 2015 for these offences. He was born in Afghanistan and had a chaotic, traumatic and disrupted childhood. At the age of six or seven, his primary school was bombed and his teacher and best friend were both killed. His family fled Afghanistan due to the ongoing civil war and turmoil. They went to India in 1988 before migrating to Australia in 1993. The family experienced difficulties in adjusting to their new life in Australia.
	
	
	The psychiatric report refers to the opinion of the offenders’ sister that their father suffered from “war depression” and inflicted “frequent harsh physical discipline” on Farhad. Compounding this, Farhad witnessed a further violent death (of a fellow school student) during his early adolescence whilst in attendance at Canley Vale Behaviour School.
	
	
	The offender resorted to drugs for a sustained period in an attempt to “avoid” feelings of “fear and anger” arising from years of sustained traumatic experiences. His drug use commenced at the age of 13 years. His substance abuse, especially his use of cannabis, increased during his adolescence and he committed robberies to sustain this habit. He told the psychiatrist that he was using “three to four ounces” of cocaine during a “session” in the period leading up to the present offending. A “session” might last from a Friday through to Monday. This is an extraordinary amount of cocaine to consume and speaks to either a raging drug habit or an exaggeration of his use in his interview with the psychiatrist. In either case, it is well established that drug addiction is not a mitigating feature unless it can be clearly related to matters outside an offender’s control, such as where an offender has become addicted to drugs in the course of medical treatment. The drug use in this case is more likely to be the result of self-indulgence although I do not discount the possibility that the use of drugs at a young age arose from an attempt to escape a dysfunctional and brutalised childhood. He also told the psychiatrist that he was using anabolic steroids on and off from 2002 and that he would get a “bit of ‘roid rage’”. He told Dr Eagle that his steroid use caused mood swings. There was some evidence in the trial, particularly in the form of recorded telephone calls, that supported the proposition that Farhad’s mood was unpredictable and that he became enraged with little warning and over the smallest sight.
	
	
	Dr Eagle diagnosed Farhad with a complex post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder as well as an anti-social personality disorder. The latter diagnosis was based on a “pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of others”. He was exposed to severe violence and death from a very young age and the repeated exposure “re-traumatising him and thus exacerbating existing trauma related symptoms”. The report suggests that the offender’s experience of trauma has “altered his perspective of the world, such that he views the world as an unsafe and terrifying place” and resulted in “persistent feelings of fear and anger”. The offender’s life experiences and the psychological conditions resulting from this trauma have played a role in a life caught in the cycle of violence and criminality.
	
	
	I accept that the experience of trauma may have altered Farhad Qaumi’s perspective of the world. While the seriousness of the offending means that nothing can excuse the choices that he has made, his early life as a traumatised child and the post-traumatic stress disorder that has resulted is an important consideration in settling on the weight to be afforded to general deterrence and in determining whether his moral culpability is diminished as a result. [29] 
	
	
	The judgment of Carruthers J in R v FQ confirms the significant parts of the offender’s personal and psychiatric history. In particular, there was a report before the Court (in 1998) that Farhad was “exposed to horrific and extensive war related trauma and carnage”. Reference was made to the death of his friend in the school bombing. His post-traumatic stress disorder was said to be “lessening”. A worrying aspect of the 1998 report was that some of his personality traits were “described as almost psychopathic in nature”.
	
	
	Farhad’s criminal history spans over 20 years with his first conviction recorded in June 1996 at the age of 13. The convictions are for a diverse range of offending including driving while disqualified, aggravated robbery, possession of an unregistered firearm and causing grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to murder. While he has previously been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, nothing in his criminal history approaches the gravity of the crimes he committed between October and December 2013 for which he is now to be sentenced. His criminal history, at least, disentitles him to leniency. It also raises real questions as to his future dangerousness and whether the record should be treated as a circumstance of aggravation. [30] 
	
	
	I return to the observation in the earlier report suggesting Farhad’s personality traits were “almost psychopathic”. The pattern of conduct demonstrated in the cases before me suggests some form of psychopathic disorder as that term is generally understood. Apart from him readily resorting to extreme violence and the methods he used to control his fellow gang members, a particularly disturbing aspect of his conduct was the use of people like Witness D and Witness K to do his bidding. Witness D was a young Hazara man whose performance in the witness box showed that he was “slow” to the point of having some form of intellectual disability. He was often confused and did not understand the questions. He was literal in his responses. He sometimes smiled at the men in the dock as if to seek their approval and reassurance. His description of his induction into the gang (when he was hugged as a brother) was chilling because it was clear he was being manipulated and used. [31]  There was a silence in the court room as he gave his evidence and the mood in the trial changed. His evidence was compelling. He was a soft target for Farhad. Witness K was Farhad’s young cousin who had a job and appeared to have his life in order away from the criminal milieu. In spite of this, Farhad used him to move the murder weapon after the Antoun shooting. This explained his brother’s (Witness J’s) anger in his recorded conversations with Farhad on 4 January 2014. [32] 
	
	
	Farhad’s subjective case presents a conundrum. I accept that his exposure to violence in Afghanistan and his dislocated family life caused the psychiatric conditions described by Dr Eagle. I accept that this explains his conduct and diminishes his moral culpability to a degree. I accept it plays a role in assessing the extent to which general deterrence should guide the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, the evidence also creates the kind of situation in which the offender’s mental condition or personality disorder gives rise to concerns as to his capacity to rehabilitate and the danger he presents to the community. Accordingly, the protection of the community must play a significant, if not dominant, role in the assessment of an appropriate sentence. [33] 
	


Mumtaz Qaumi


	
	Mumtaz Qaumi tendered a psychiatric report under the hand of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 29 March 2017. He also tendered testimonials from his wife (Wasillah Qaumi) and his mother (Gulmaki Qaumi).
	
	
	Mumtaz is 32 years old, married with 4 children. The youngest child was born after the offender was taken into custody. Mumtaz was born in Afghanistan and spent his early childhood in the midst of the Afghan war. The family fled Afghanistan to India and eventually Australia, after his father was kidnapped and a number of his mother’s relatives were killed. [34] 
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mumtaz with an anxiety disorder, based on a “history of typical panic attacks, and features consistent with post traumatic anxiety” and a depressive illness, in partial remission. [35]  The report lists a number of factors contributing to his development of anxiety and depression, including a family history of psychotic illness, the effects of exposure to traumatic events in early childhood, the hardship he experienced as a refugee and “the effects of witnessing the immediate aftermath of the homicide of his aunt by his mentally ill cousin”. [36]  The report suggests the offenders clinical condition meant that there was an “increased perception of threat associated with having an anxiety disorder” and noted, the alleged “real threats from the deceased and his associates”. [37]  The offender also reported what appeared to be “realistic anxiety for his own safety, based on having received plausible threats.” [38]  I interpolate that these findings are particularly relevant to the manslaughter charge and conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy but are also relevant to the series of shootings directed against other members of the BFL Bankstown. On the other hand, Joseph Antoun – the victim of the most serious offence – represented no threat, real or imagined, to the offender or his family. He was killed for money.
	
	
	While Mumtaz Qaumi denies any involvement in the criminal activity of the Brothers For Life group, he asserts that his involvement in the offences was prompted after receiving a phone call from his brother Farhad, who believed his own life was threatened. The offender allegedly returned to Sydney to “help protect his brother”. [39]  This must be a reference to the Hamzy shooting.
	
	
	The report states the offender felt “a lot of sympathy for the victim and his wife” and stated that he could “feel their pain”. [40]  It is not clear whether this relates to the Hamzy or the Antoun shooting. In any event, in light of the conduct of the proceedings, and the hearsay nature of this assertion, I am unable to place very much, if any, weight on this self-serving expression of contrition although it may well be genuine.
	
	
	Mumtaz reported regular use of cannabis between 2010 and 2013, which he explained helped him to control his anxiety. However, he denied any substance use at the time of the commission of the offences. [41]  The offender has been in the past, and remains, medicated for this anxiety disorder with a combination of an antidepressant and a sedating antipsychotic medication. [42] 
	
	
	Wasillah Qaumi said that Mumtaz was a very supportive husband and a “great” father. They met in the city of Quetta in Pakistan in 2007. Mumtaz remained with her as she waited for her visa to be approved to come to Australia, despite suffering from anxiety attacks and living in “constant fear of being kidnapped and held for ransom” as a “foreigner”. They arrived in Sydney in 2008 and Mrs Qaumi said that in 2011 Mumtaz’s physical health deteriorated due to a damaged disk in his lower back. He was in a great deal of pain. This “took a toll on himself and his family, as he started changing”. Mrs Qaumi reported “mood swings” from medication prescribed, regular use of marijuana (to “ease the pain”), and “regular panic attacks”. Mrs Qaumi reported her husband was “depressed and rarely left the house to engage in social activity”. By 2013, her husband was happier, began socialising and purchased a kebab shop in Erina. However, by November of that year, she noticed a “change in his behaviour” as he appeared “in constant fear of his and his family’s safety”. Upon hearing his brother Jamil had been arrested, Mumtaz told his family that “there were people who wanted to harm him and his brothers” and suggested they move to Brisbane as Sydney was “no longer safe”. Mrs Qaumi reports that they were in “the process of moving” when Mumtaz was arrested.
	
	
	Gulmaki Qaumi is the mother of all three offenders. She described the “horrifying conditions” she and her children were subjected to during their time in Afghanistan. She describes how she still remembers her children’s “hearts thumping” in her ears and how they would “shiver, scream and cry in fear each time a bomb hit or shots were fired nearby”. After escaping to India, day-to-day life was very difficult for the family. Mrs Qaumi noted that there were no counselling services available to them at this time. Life remained difficult when the family arrived in Australia in 1993 and Mrs Qaumi described the impact her husband’s depression had on her children. Mrs Qaumi described how although they “survived the war”, they “remained impacted by it”.
	
	
	Mumtaz has a criminal history. [43]  This commenced in the Children’s Court where he was placed on a control order for offences of detain for advantage and robbery committed when he was 16 years of age. As an adult, he had numerous driving offences and some serious offences of violence for which he was sentenced to imprisonment. This included demanding property by force, stealing from the person and assault police, a series of crimes for which he was sentenced to more than two years imprisonment in 2005. He had no convictions between 2006 and the commission of the present offences. That gap in his criminality is of some significance. However, since his arrest, he was sentenced to possession of a mobile telephone and SIM card while being in custody and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. While Mumtaz Qaumi’s criminal history disentitles him to the leniency that would be afforded to a first offender, it does not constitute an aggravating feature or engage the principles discussed by the High Court in Veen (No 2).
	
	
	In Mumtaz Qaumi’s case, the psychiatric evidence and the history of trauma and dislocation are of some significance to an assessment of the proper sentence. [44]  They receive support from the evidence of his wife and mother. The psychiatric issues pre-date the commission of the current offences. I accept Dr Nielssen’s conclusions as to the connection between his anxiety disorder and the offences arising out of the dispute with BFL Bankstown. This impacts on his moral culpability and the weight to be afforded to general deterrence. I am not satisfied on balance that his time in custody is more onerous due his mental health issues although I accept Dr Nielssen’s assessment that the conditions of his incarceration are very onerous, a matter which became a focus of attention late in the course of the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The long gap in Mumtaz’s criminal history (2006-2013), the support he has from his wife, the incentive to reform represented by his infant children and Dr Nielssen’s opinion that his anxiety disorder is “generally quite responsive to treatment” lead me to conclude (as did Dr Nielssen) that Mumtaz Qaumi has “reasonable prospects for longer-term rehabilitation”.
	


Jamil Qaumi


	
	Jamil Qaumi tendered a report prepared by a psychologist (Ann-Marie De Santa Brigida) and testimonials from his older sister and his wife.
	
	
	Jamil was born in 1992 and was 21 years old at the time of the offences and 25 years old at the time of sentence. He married shortly before the offences. Apart from a common assault and failing to leave the restricted area of a railway station, for which he was fined a total of $700, he has no prior convictions. The absence of a significant criminal record is a mitigating feature. However, since being taken into custody he has been sentenced for assaulting two prisoner officers by throwing water on them, pretending it was urine. He received a two month sentence for that offence.
	
	
	He was born in India and so was not directly exposed to the horrors of the Afghan war. However Ms Brigida refers to the possibility of “inter-generational transmission of trauma”. Given the post-traumatic stress suffered by his older brothers and father, I am prepared to accept this possibility although the report does not suggest any particular link between that vicarious condition and the offending. Of more significance is his exposure to violence in the form of a “drive-by” shooting when he was 13 years of age and his “allegiance” to his brothers. He has a history of substance abuse.
	
	
	Jamil’s sister (Shaista Amin) described Jamil as “very family oriented” and a “very caring person”. When Mrs Amin was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during her fifth pregnancy in 2013, Jamil “took responsibility” for her children and helped Mrs Amin with domestic life. Mrs Amin states that Jamil “made sure my [her] kids were always safe and happy”. She also described Jamil going “out of his way” to help an elderly neighbour suffering from cancer. Mrs Amin believes that Jamil committed the offences for which he is now to be sentenced “out of fear” triggered by a drive-by shooting at their home in 2006. She thinks Jamil feared that he would “lose family members for no reason”. Mrs Amin believes her brother is “deeply remorseful” for “his involvement in the death of Mahmoud Hamzy” and describes how he “sincerely regrets his offences and what he has put the victims, his own wife and our [the] family through”.
	
	
	Jamil’s wife (Farishta Qaumi) described a supportive husband and a man that had “a lot of love for his family and everyone around him”. The pair married in Islamabad, Pakistan in 2013 and remained there for 5 months until Farishta’s Australian visa was granted. Mrs Qaumi described “behavioural changes” in the weeks before his arrest. Her husband became “over protective … fearing something that he never spoke about”. Mrs Qaumi stated that she and Jamil’s family did not attend the trial as “Jamil thought it wasn’t safe”. Mrs Qaumi said that her husband “regrets his involvement in the death of Mahmoud Hamzy” and that he “feels terrible about what happened”.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Jamil’s sister and wife and the opinions stated by the psychologist. I accept that Jamil was under the influence of his elder brothers, particularly Farhad, and that he became involved in the BFL Blacktown as a result of that connection. I am not prepared to act on the hearsay expressions of contrition and remorse. In spite of his offending since being incarcerated, misgivings arising from the various counts of contempt and the grave offending for which he is to be sentenced, his youth and family support satisfy me that he has some prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Approach to the subjective cases


	
	While family and subjective circumstances such as those I have just described are extremely moving, it is important not to lose sight of the gravity of the offending in this case. The sad personal circumstances of the offenders and their families cannot lead the court to impose a sentence that is unduly disproportionate to the crimes. Also, it is important not to forget the impact of the crimes on the individual victims and on the community more generally. I have no doubt that the number and frequency of the shootings in late 2013 caused fear in the community and did violence to people’s right to feel safe and secure as they go about their business. It is important then to record the impact on the victims and it is to that subject that I now turn.
	


the impact on the victims


	
	Many people’s lives have been affected by the outlandish and lawless violence in which these three offenders were involved over a one to two month period in latter part of 2013. Two men are dead and it is pure good fortune that more people were not killed. Many people were exposed to the gangland and gun violence instigated by the offenders. In some cases, the impact of the offenders’ conduct on the victims and their loved ones is devastating. In saying this, it must be remembered that Jamil Qaumi is not to be punished for the killing of Joseph Antoun and Farhad Qaumi is not responsible for those wounded in the Chokolatta Café shooting.
	
	
	Hassnah Hamzy is the sister of Mahmoud Hamzy. She provided a victim’s impact statement that explained her whole family’s loss and grief. [45]  She told me her brother was a beautiful soul who wouldn’t hurt a fly and that he was killed by people who didn’t even know his name because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Since her brother’s homicide, Hassnah has trouble coping and becomes very emotional and breaks down over little things. She says she will never be the same person she was before. She said her parents have changed and that nobody in the family will ever be the same. The family treats their lives as “before” and “after” the killing of Mahmoud. Not only have they lost their loved one, but their shared memories have been destroyed because of the way Mahmoud was killed. The family no longer enjoys family trips away, and does not celebrate religious holidays because Mahmoud’s absence is so palpable and painful. They cannot bear it.
	
	
	Omar Ajaj sustained two gunshot wounds, one to the right upper leg in the thigh region and one to the right hand side of his abdomen. A bone in his right leg was fractured. Mr Ajaj was treated by paramedics, taken to Liverpool Hospital and was not discharged until 5 November 2013. There was no issue at the trial, and the jury found, that his injuries constituted grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Michael Odisho suffered gunshot wounds described earlier. He required surgery and appears to have made a good recovery.
	
	
	In addition to the physical injuries suffered by Mr Odisho, his mother was present when her son was shot. She gave evidence in the trial and was obviously distressed and greatly affected by the experience of a gunman coming to her home and shooting her son.
	
	
	The injuries to H (an innocent fourteen year old child) were potentially life threatening. Many hundreds of shotgun pellets were left in her body and doctors were unable to remove all of the pellets. This resulted in lead poisoning that may affect her ability to conceive a child or to carry a pregnancy to full term. Her demeanour when giving evidence, while courageous and at times feisty, showed that she was traumatised by the incident. A number of other people, including the proposed target and his family, were present when the shotgun was fired at or into their home. Again, while no evidence was adduced, it is reasonable to assume that being exposed to a shooting attack in the place they were entitled to feel safe has had an impact on each of them.
	
	
	In the Chokolatta Café shooting, two men received shotgun injuries. Abdul Abu-Mahmoud suffered “injuries caused by shotgun pellets and associated shrapnel”. These injuries were to the back of his head, neck and shoulder. The injuries were not life threatening but required surgical intervention to remove the shotgun pellets. Hassan Souid received injuries to the back of the scalp, right biceps and the back of the shoulder. [46] 
	
	
	Four victim’s impact statements were read explaining the devastation wrought on the family of Joseph Antoun. [47]  His partner, Teagan Mullins, read her own statement and also those of her two daughters. His brother, Nemer Antoun, also read a statement.
	
	
	Ms Mullens spoke of the bond between Mr Antoun and the twins and how Joe would come home every night to spend time with the girls. She has been left financially ruined and emotionally traumatised. She gave an emotional account of watching her husband die and her little girls waving as the ambulance took their father away. She suffers panic attacks and her health has been greatly affected. She and Joe were to get married the year after he was killed. The twins were to be the flower girls at the wedding. They will never have their father at school assemblies when they receive awards and will not have the example of their parents’ loving relationship to learn from and to emulate.
	
	
	The simple and moving testimonies of the little girls spoke for themselves. They miss their Dad who gave the “best cuddles”, always let them choose the movies and came home to put them to bed each night. They miss him in the morning and when they come home from school. They said it is not fun to see their mum “all emotional” when they visit their Dad at the cemetery.
	
	
	Nemer Antoun spoke of his brother who was nicknamed the White Rooster. He remembers jumping the fence with Joe to watch the Rabbitohs. He spoke of the family bond, the weekly visits Joe would make to his elderly mother and the loss to the twins. He spoke of Joe’s relationship with the Thungutti community near Kempsey where Joe was welcomed as a brother. The people there held a service for Joe after he died. Joe was murdered in cold blood in front of his wife and children and Nemer asked “For what?” and “who has the right to kill for no reason and take a man from his children or a boy from his mother?” Nemer is on a crusade for justice.
	
	
	I am grateful to the family of Joseph Antoun for their courage and openness in reading their statements to the Court. What you have told me will be taken into account in accordance with the law.
	
	
	The Crown made an application under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides:
	


“A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim’s death on the members of the primary victim’s immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.”


	
	The difficulties in the application of this section, in the face of the fundamental principles that all human life is sacred and that all people are equal under the law, have been discussed in a number of cases. [48]  In R v Halloun McCallum J said of s 28(4):
	


“I would construe the new provision as an important mechanism for ensuring that the evidence of family victims is placed before the court to give texture to the undoubted proposition that every unlawful taking of a human life harms the community in some way. In that way, the provision serves the purposes of sentencing stated in s. 3A of the Act, one of which is to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	That comment was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sumpton v R, an appeal from a sentencing decision in which I applied her Honour’s statement of principle. On that basis, I consider it appropriate to take into account the victim’s impact statements of Hassnah Hamzy and the family of Joseph Antoun in determining the appropriate penalty on the basis that the harm done to them is an aspect of harm done to the community.
	


PRINCIPLES of sentencing


	
	The common law has developed a unified set of principles guiding the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Those principles are well established and it is not necessary to set out each and every one of them in order to satisfy the primary purpose of a judgment (or remarks) on sentence, which is to explain to the offender, the community and those affected by the crimes why a particular sentence is being imposed. Legislation in relation to sentencing makes the task more technical and complex, especially in a case like this where there are so many different offences. Even so, sentencing ought not to descend into the application of “some sort of checklist”. [49]  For example, I do not propose to go through all of the offences, addressing each and every aggravating and mitigating factor in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It will be clear from these remarks the matters that are aggravating and those that are mitigating. Even so, it is appropriate that I set out some of the important legal principles and to explain how I have applied those principles to the particular facts and circumstances of the present case. It is also necessary to attempt to comply with the technical aspects of the sentencing legislation.
	


Purposes of punishment


	
	I must always keep in mind the purposes of sentencing and punishment. The common law principles that underpin those purposes now find, in New South Wales, statutory voice in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They are:
	



	
	To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
	
	
	To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
	
	
	To protect the community from the offender;
	
	
	To promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
	
	
	To make the offender accountable for his actions;
	
	
	To denounce the conduct of the offender; and
	
	
	To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community.
	



	
	The weight to be given to these various purposes will vary from case to case and from offender to offender. In a case like this, involving gangland violence and homicide, general deterrence must play a significant role. The sentences imposed on these three men must send a clear message that those involved in gang violence will receive substantial punishment. Similarly, the offenders must be adequately punished and made accountable for their actions. Their conduct must be denounced. The protection of the community is important, and particularly so in the case of Farhad Qaumi in light of his criminal record and leadership of the BFL Blacktown. The harm done to the victims, and to the community, must be recognised. In view of the length of sentence that I am obliged to impose on Farhad and Mumtaz, it is difficult to see how any sentence that I could formulate would promote the rehabilitation of the two older brothers. The promotion of rehabilitation is a more significant factor in Jamil’s case because he does not face the prospect of a sentence of life imprisonment and is still a young man.
	


Aggravating and mitigating features


	
	As I have said, I will not go through each offence to check off the relevant aggravating and mitigating features identified in s 21A. However, given the abundance of litigation that s 21A has generated, I should say something general and brief about the operation of that provision. Where a matter identified as an aggravating feature in s 21A(2) is either an element of the offence or where it is inherent in that offence, it ought not to be “double counted” as an “aggravating feature” under the statute. A simple example is that the aggravating feature in s 21A(2)(c) – the use of a weapon – could not be considered to be an aggravating feature in relation to an offence of possession of a weapon or an offence of firing a firearm at a dwelling.
	
	
	In the present case, many of the offences are aggravated because they involved the use of a weapon. However, many offences of the kind charged against the offenders involve the use of a weapon and the matter ought not to be given undue weight as an aggravating feature. However, in assessing the totality of the criminality involved in this case, one of the most significant factors is the number of guns used, their ready availability and the offender’s willingness to engage others to use them to carry out crimes of extreme violence.
	
	
	Another significant aggravating factor arises in the offences that took place in peoples’ homes (the Hamzy, Odisho and Zakaria shootings) and where the offences showed a disregard for the safety of the public (the Chokolatta Café shooting). Further, all of the offences were part of a planned and organised criminal activity. I have already referred to the approach that the Court must take to organised crime and gangland violence.
	
	
	The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of aggravating features and the descriptions I have given of the offences should disclose the reasons I have formed the view as to the objective criminality of each of the offences.
	
	
	The most compelling mitigating feature in relation to each of the offenders is not dealt with under s 21A(3). This concerns, in the case of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi, the offenders’ personal history, their traumatic experiences in Afghanistan and the psychiatric impact this has had on each of them. It cannot be said that this meant that they were not “fully aware of the consequences of their actions” [s 21A(3)(j)]. However, it is well accepted that a history such as this “may mitigate the sentence that may otherwise be appropriate” because:
	


“ … a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending”. [50] 


	
	This “may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.” [51]  The passages I am quoting are from the High Court’s decision in Bugmy v The Queen. The High Court was there dealing with an Aboriginal offender whose development was affected by a life of deprivation and exposure to alcohol abuse but the Court was clear in saying that the relevance of such matters was not determined by the ethnicity of the offender.
	
	
	In Jamil Qaumi’s case, his youth, lack of prior convictions, previous good character and prospects of rehabilitation are relevant mitigating factors. It is also the case that he was acting under the influence of his older brothers and was “hyper vigilant” because of his exposure at a young age of a drive by shooting targeting his older brother.
	


Parity and proportionality


	
	It is a fundamental principle of equal justice that offenders who are charged with offences arising out of the same factual circumstances should receive sentences which are proportionate to one another. [52]  The principle is not restricted to situations where the offenders are charged with the same offence. [53]  An offender should not be left with a “justifiable sense of grievance” or seen to wear “the badge of unfairness” as a result of disparity between the sentences that is not justified by relevant differences. [54] 
	
	
	In the present case, the parties tendered a body of material to allow me to give effect to those principles. [55]  I have also considered the decisions in R v AC; AC v R [2017] NSWCCA 20 and R v MM; R v WK [2017] NSWCCA 19 in which the original sentencing judgments (contained in Ex S-B) were upheld on appeal. The Crown also provided a helpful table setting out the sentences imposed on co-offenders in relation to a number of the offences, the charges that each faced, the extent of any “discount” for a guilty plea or assistance to authorities, the Form 1 offences taken into account in sentence and any other offence to which any particular offender pleaded guilty. [56] 
	
	
	In two cases (Witnesses L and M), I was the sentencing judge while the remaining co-offenders (Witnesses C, D and I) were dealt with in the District Court. In many cases, the charges to which the co-offenders pleaded guilty were different (usually, but not always, less serious) than those for which the current offenders are to be sentenced. By way of example, Witness I was charged with discharging firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in respect of the Odisho and Zakaria shootings, while the offenders are to be sentenced for soliciting murder in each case and attempted murder in the case of Odisho. Witness M was sentenced for accessory before the fact to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy, whereas the offenders are to be sentenced for manslaughter. Witness L was sentenced for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to the Hamzy shooting.
	
	
	The differences in the charges gives rise to difficulties in the application of the parity principle but, as the High Court emphasised in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen, equal justice requires that the sentence imposed on each of the co-offenders be considered carefully to ensure that the sentences imposed on the Qaumi brothers are proportionate and do not leave them with a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	Apart from the different charges, there are also significant differences in the personal case of each offender and in their criminal histories. All of the co-offenders received reductions for their pleas and assistance and I have considered the “starting point” in applying the parity principle and in determining the appropriate sentence for the three offenders in respect of any offence where a co-offender has already been sentenced. Where an aggregate sentence was imposed on the co-offender, I have considered the “indicative sentence” nominated by the sentencing Judge under s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	All of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders are significant to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion, but the most significant to my mind are the sentences imposed on Witness M for her involvement in the Hamzy shooting and Witness L for his involvement in both the Hamzy shooting and the Antoun murder.
	
	
	I have applied the principles of parity and proportionality in sentencing the offenders. I have considered the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. I have also considered a comparison of the sentences as between the three brothers themselves to ensure that there is equal (or proportionate) justice between them and that none of them is left with a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	As between the three brothers, and speaking generally rather than in relation to any particular offence, principles of equal justice require the total sentencing outcome for Farhad to be more punitive than that of his brothers. That is because he was the undisputed and greatly feared leader of the gang. He also has a worse criminal history and, in spite of his sympathetic personal history, there is nothing in the evidence in his case that allows for a positive finding in relation to rehabilitation. The sentence he receives must be calculated to protect the community from the kind of violence that he and his gang unleashed during the last two months of 2013. Again, because of his youth and relatively unblemished criminal history, Jamil Qaumi can expect to receive a sentence of shorter duration than that imposed on his brothers. Within the different offences, different considerations apply. For example, Jamil and Farhad offered to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy and the sentence they receive will reflect that. Jamil asked for serious offences to be taken into account in sentencing for the manslaughter and that will increase the weight given to retribution and specific deterrence in relation to that charge. While the offenders were acting together, Mumtaz Qaumi was far less active in the preparations for the Zakaria shooting, a fact reflected in the jury’s verdicts. The individual sentences must reflect these differences.
	


Totality, concurrence and accumulation, aggregate sentencing


	
	The first step in this complex exercise is to determine an appropriate sentence for each individual offence. It is then necessary to make decisions about the extent to which those sentences should be ordered to be served concurrently or cumulatively. If the sentences are accumulated, it is necessary to stand back at the end of the process and determine whether the overall sentence is correct having regard to the principle of totality.
	
	
	This process is made easier by the provision in section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That section provides that a sentencing Judge “may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.” If the Court imposes an aggregate sentence, it “must indicate to the offender” that an aggregate sentence is to be imposed and the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed. [57] 
	
	
	In Cahill v R [58]  and Glare v R, [59]  the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) was considered. It is necessary to indicate the individual sentences that would have been imposed “after taking into account such matters as are relevant under part 3 or any other provision of this Act”. This means that I must indicate the putative sentences that would have been imposed having considered all relevant principles of sentencing, taking into account the aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A and any discounts (such as the reduction for the offers to plead guilty to manslaughter in Farhad and Jamil Qaumi’s cases). [60] 
	
	
	Section 44(2C) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that it is not necessary to indicate the individual non-parole periods that would have been imposed had an aggregate sentence not been imposed. [61]  However, in those counts to which a standard non-parole period applies, s 54B(4) requires me to indicate the non-parole period that I would have set. The insertion of s 45(1A) in 2016 provides a possible discretionary exception to this requirement. It is difficult to read the two provisions in conformity with one another and I propose to indicate a non-parole period in most cases that would result from the application of s 44 and in the absence of a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In a case such as the present, these provisions create what seem to be unnecessary complication and technicality but I must do my best to comply with them. Subject to a determination of whether a life sentence is to be imposed on Farhad or Mumtaz Qaumi for the Antoun murder, I propose to impose an aggregate sentence in relation to all offences except for the contempt charges against Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi. I propose to impose fixed term sentences for the contempt charges and to commence the aggregate sentence at the conclusion of the sentence for those offences. I do this because the contempt offences are separated by time and circumstance from the other offences. It is also appropriate that the Court be seen to impose a clear and separate punishment for offences involving contempt in the face of the Court.
	
	
	Because an aggregate sentence is to be imposed, it is not necessary to indicate the degree to which I would have accumulated, or to indicate the method of staggering the commencement dates in order to achieve an appropriate balance between cumulation and concurrence. [62]  However, all of the offences are serious and the imposition of an aggregate sentence “is not to be used to minimise the offending conduct, or obscure or obliterate the range of offending conduct or its totality”. [63]  What must ultimately be achieved is an aggregate sentence commensurate with the totality of the criminality in each offender’s case. In relation to the offences targeting the BFL Bankstown, it will be born in mind that the offenders are charged with a number of offences that took place over a period of around a week and that, in some instances, they are charged with more than one offence arising out of the same criminal enterprise. For example, count 4 (soliciting the murder of Michael Odisho) comprises more or less the same acts as count 5 (intent to murder Michael Odisho). The same applies with respect to a number of firearms offences. If individual sentences were imposed for those two counts, it would be expected that there would be a large degree of concurrency and some degree of accumulation. All of these matters must be taken into account in determining the appropriate aggregate sentence for what is a most serious series of criminal offences.
	


Offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in respect of the Hamzy shooting


	
	The parties agreed that on 15 February 2016, Farhad Qaumi offered to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy. This was part way through a pre-trial hearing that commenced in November 2015 and concluded in April 2017. It was a late offer to plead but well before the trial actually commenced. The offer was not accepted by the prosecution but was vindicated by the jury’s verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. There was no offer to plead guilty to any other charge. Had the offer been accepted, the trial would have proceeded over a number of months but there would have been some saving in court time. It had some, if rather limited, utilitarian value.
	
	
	The parties agreed that on 16 March 2016, Jamil Qaumi made a similar offer. Again, there was no offer in relation to any other charge and the Crown rejected the offer. This offer to plead guilty was even later than that made by Farhad Qaumi. Its utilitarian value was also limited but it had some capacity to save court time.
	
	
	A number of cases have considered the approach that should be taken by a sentencing Judge when the prosecution rejects an offender’s offer to plead guilty to an offence for which they are ultimately to be sentenced. [64]  As Hidden J said in R v Cardoso it would be “unacceptable” “if the measure of leniency afforded to an offender [who was] prepared to plead guilty to a lesser charge fairly available on the evidence, would depend on the Crown’s attitude.” [65] 
	
	
	I intend to reduce the sentences of Farhad and Jamil Qaumi in relation to the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy by about 10% based on their late offer to plead guilty.
	


Commencement date


	
	The parties agree that any sentence imposed on Farhad Qaumi should commence on 9 January 2014, the day he went into custody in relation to these or related matters.
	
	
	Mumtaz Qaumi went into custody on 9 January 2014. However, he was sentenced in 2015 for an offence of “inmate possess mobile phone/SIM card etc”. [66]  That sentence was reduced on appeal to the District Court and replaced by a sentence of seven months with a non-parole period commencing 14 October 2015 and expiring 13 April 2016. This creates a complication in terms of the commencement date of the sentence. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides a wide discretion as to the commencement date. [67]  Considering principles of totality, the offence for which Mumtaz was sentenced was a very minor one in the context of the current sentencing exercise. However, it is separate offending and there should be some very small degree of accumulation. I propose to order that the sentences imposed on Mumtaz Qaumi will commence on 9 February 2014. That is to say, there will be an accumulation of one month but the earlier sentence will otherwise be subsumed by the current sentences.
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi went into custody on 7 November 2013. On 26 May 2017 he was sentenced to 2 months for two counts of common assault involving throwing a milk carton containing a substance at two corrective services officer. [68]  The suspicion was that the substance was urine (and that is what the charge sheet says) because Jamil yelled the words “how do like the taste of piss you dog cunt” after throwing the carton. However, the agreed facts state that the substance was water. While the Crown fairly concedes that I could make this sentence wholly concurrent, in my view it should be marked by some degree of extra punishment. I take the same approach to that adopted in Mumtaz’s case. The commencement date for the first of the contempt offences will be 7 December 2013.
	


Conditions of incarceration


	
	At the conclusion of the two day sentencing hearing on 7 April 2017, the offenders asked for time to obtain evidence of their conditions of incarceration. The matter came back before the Court on 26 April 2017. An affidavit of Jamil Qaumi was tendered. [69]  The Crown did not object to the affidavit and did not seek to cross-examine Jamil on its contents. [70]  The Crown and counsel for Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi then sought more time to obtain additional evidence in relation to this issue. The matter was adjourned until 23 May 2017 when the issue was litigated over many hours, with the Court sitting well beyond 4:00pm to ensure that the evidence and submissions on sentence might, finally, come to an end. [71] 
	


The evidence


	
	Affidavits by Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi were read and marked as exhibits and each was cross-examined. [72]  Three Corrective Services Officers provided affidavits, gave evidence and were cross-examined. [73] 
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor also sought to tender a statement of Detective Inspector Patton (and a folder full of attachments) and there was a lengthy legal argument as to the admissibility of large parts of the document. [74]  I admitted the statement provisionally, restricted cross-examination to certain parts and subsequently ruled parts of the document to be inadmissible. The statement provided extracts of recorded telephone conversations involving one or more of the three offenders. The material fell into three broad categories.
	
	
	First, evidence of the offenders describing their custodial conditions in uncomplaining, if not glowing, terms. For example, on 2 December 2013 (before he went into custody on this occasion), Farhad told his mother “we call it Silverwater Hotel … they are now in a hotel mom”. Similarly, on 12 March 2015, Mumtaz agreed with another inmate that being “in the main” [part of the gaol] was like a “five star retreat”. There was also a conversation in which Jamil told a friend that he trained twice a day. This type of evidence was obviously relevant and admissible on the issue of whether the custodial conditions were so onerous that it might be treated as a reason to ameliorate the length of the sentence. However, the evidence is not of great significance. The comments made by Farhad Qaumi were made before he was in custody and, given the timing of events, are open to the interpretation that he was trying to comfort his mother after the arrest of her youngest son (Jamil). The comments of Mumtaz and Jamil appeared to have been made when they were in the “main” part of the gaol and had access to the type of facilities that they were generally denied while on remand.
	
	
	The second broad category of evidence led through Detective Patton involved the offenders discussing the commission of offences while in custody. This included offences of violence (Farhad and Mumtaz discussing stabbing another inmate) and bringing contraband into the gaol (Jamil discussing a friend bringing steroids into the prison). The Crown’s position was that this evidence supported its case that the offenders were in onerous custodial conditions as a result of their own misconduct. The offenders objected on the grounds that there was no evidence that these conversations were brought to the attention of prison authorities and no evidence that they played any part in the offender’s classification or designation that led them to be held in the conditions of which they complained. In evidence, Inspector Patton said that he caused some of the material to be brought to the attention of prison authorities. However, he could not say who he told, and his evidence was imprecise as to what was communicated. He agreed that he did not provide (or cause to be provided) the recordings themselves to the prison authorities. There was no clear or direct evidence from the Corrective Services Officers (or otherwise) to support the proposition that these recordings played any role in the classification of the offenders as high security inmates or as inmates who should be segregated (either for the safety of others or their own protection). The timing of when the offenders received their various classifications and designations does not support the contention that the information provided by Mr Patton played any part in these classifications. While the evidence is before me, it is entitled to little weight and I must be cautious not to allow extraneous information concerning other wrongdoing, or threatened wrongdoing, to influence an assessment of an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The third aspect of Detective Patton’s evidence was that the recorded ‘phone calls (or some of them) were made on contraband mobile telephones. Mumtaz Qaumi was convicted in the Local Court of being an inmate in possession of a mobile telephone [75]  and Farhad Qaumi had a disciplinary charge of possessing “a mobile” as well as a charger and SIM card. As with the second broad category of evidence, there was no evidence of any link between these breaches and the conditions of custody in which the offenders are held. Again, while taking the matter into account in assessing the prosecution’s submission that the offenders are the authors of their own fate, I am unable to give this matter very much weight.
	
	
	I generally accept the evidence given by the three offenders. Jamil Qaumi’s evidence was not challenged in cross-examination and I found Mumtaz and Farhad Qaumi to be reliable in their account of their custodial conditions. Some of what they said was supported by the evidence of the Corrective Services Officers. I am conscious of the fact that they may have exaggerated the onerous nature of the conditions to some degree but the important parts of their evidence were worthy of credit. I accept that each of the offenders has spent long periods in virtual isolation, or solitary confinement, that they have not had access to programmes, gym equipment and, most significantly, access to the outside spaces. I accept they are subject to strict security during legal visits and when they are transported from gaol to gaol or from gaol to court. It is difficult to reconcile some of the evidence of their restricted ability to have visits with the records tendered by the Crown. However, overall, I accept that these conditions are more onerous than is generally the case.
	
	
	I also generally accept the evidence given by the officers of the Department of Corrective Services although there may have been an inclination to downplay the harshness of the conditions. There was also a deal of general evidence as to how the system of classification works without much detail as to how it applied to the individual offenders. Still, each of the officers was an honest and straightforward witness.
	
	
	Philip Hugil is the Director of Classification and Placements for the Department. [76]  He explained the classification and designation of the three offenders and the grounds upon which they have been given those classifications. He explained the role of the Commissioner and the review process. He was unable to provide evidence as to the material that led to the particular classification of the three offenders. However, in general, it is based on an assessment of the risk that a prisoner poses to other inmates, to the staff at the gaol and to security issues within the gaol. Farhad was classified A-1 and Jamil and Mumtaz classified A-2. In addition, each was designated as an “Extreme High Security” inmate. This means that the Commissioner has determined that they represent an extreme danger to other people and to the good order and security of a correctional centre. Each received this designation on the basis of their “criminal antecedents and behaviour in custody”. Those are the criteria, but Mr Hugil was unable to say what the specific basis of this designation was in each case because those decisions were taken before he took over his position. Mr Hugil agreed, on the basis of documents shown to him, that Mumtaz Qaumi was kept in a “non-association cell” in spite of his request not to be placed in protection.
	
	
	Thomas Woods is the Acting Governor of the Silverwater Correctional Centre. [77]  This is where Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi have been incarcerated for a large proportion of their remand period. It is also where Farhad was detained during the trial. Mr Woods described the conditions within the facility and gave evidence of the fact that each offender has been, at times, held in segregation. This means they have limited ability to interact with other inmates. His affidavit asserted that “[Jamil] will still be able to interact verbally with his brothers as well as other inmates housed in the same location via adjoining yards.” However, he agreed in cross-examination that any such interaction would be “by yelling over a very high [about 3 metres] wall.” There is no “face to face contact”. This is an example of the tendency to understate the harshness of the conditions. On reading Mr Woods’ affidavit, I formed the impression that the offenders could have face to face, human contact with one another. That was a false impression.
	
	
	Mr Woods agreed that there was no exercise equipment and no employment or educational opportunities. Mr Woods said that Jamil was in the Silverwater gaol because his solicitors requested he be available for legal visits. Otherwise, he may have been transferred to a gaol outside of Sydney. However, because of his classification, designation and the non-association status, the conditions would have been similar. In his affidavit, Mr Woods said that Jamil was held in segregation because of an assault on two inmates. [78]  This was not correct. At the further hearing on 13 June 2017 (concerning Jamil’s Qaumi’s post incarceration assault conviction), it was indicated that the assault involved throwing water (believed to be urine) on two prisoner officers. [79]  Mr Woods confirmed that his gaol is a remand centre and that, after sentence is imposed, Jamil and Mumtaz will be transferred to another gaol.
	
	
	Geoffrey Poulsen is the Senior Assistant Superintendent of the High Risk Management Correctional Centre at Goulburn. [80]  He described the general conditions of this facility, commonly known as the “Supermax”. This is where Farhad Qaumi has been housed for a good deal of his remand period. During the trial he was held at Silverwater. Mr Poulsen was a blunt but impressive witness. He conceded a number of matters suggesting the conditions at the gaol are very onerous and the opportunity for interaction with other inmates limited. Things like the use of exercise facilities, visits by friends and relatives and the use of the telephone are highly regulated. He disagreed that Farhad Qaumi only had access to the exercise yard for one hour per day. He did not accept that A1 prisoners like Farhad were unable to interact with AA prisoners (generally, it seems, people charged with or convicted of terrorism offences). Farhad Qaumi was on the “top level” of entitlements as a result of his good behaviour. This meant for example, he was able to book time to use a chin up bar and basketball court. Mr Poulsen was unable to say when, if ever, Farhad Qaumi would get out of the Supermax.
	


The issues and legal principles


	
	This evidence and the submissions that followed gave rise to a number of legal and factual issues relevant to the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The first is that the courts are reluctant to interfere with, or second-guess, the management of prisons and inmates by those charged with the responsibility of administering them. [81]  In Kelleher v Commissioner, Department of Corrective Services McInerney J said at [11]:
	


""The exercise of powers relating to prisoner classification and separation, the transfer from one part of a prison to another, transfers between prisons, conditions on visits or access to certain conditions or facilities such as education, recreation and supply of condoms have all been characterised as administrative and managerial in nature rather then punitive and judicial. Consequently, they have been held not to give rise to any right, interest or legitimate expectation enforceable by judicial review in the ordinary courts. For example, see Smith v Commissioner of Corrective Services (1978) 1 NSWLR 317; Walker v The Queen (1992) 60 A Crim R 463; Gray v The Queen (1990) 45 A Crim R 364; and Prisoners A-XXX inclusive (1935) 38 NSWLR 622.""


	
	The second is that a sentencing Court is entitled to take into account the conditions of incarceration in which an offender has been, is being, or will be held. If those conditions are harsher than those of the general prison population, it is a matter that may provide a basis for reducing the sentence to some degree. [82]  However, there must be evidence of the conditions upon which the Court can safely act. [83]  A sentencing judge cannot assume that the conditions will be harsher based on the category of inmate into which the offender fits.
	
	
	Third, in the absence of clear evidence, it is difficult for a sentencing Judge to predict the conditions in which the offender might serve the future part of the sentence. [84]  That is true in this case. There is nothing to suggest that the offenders will be placed in less onerous (and more humane) conditions in the near future. However, according to the evidence, there is some opportunity for their conditions to change depending on their behaviour while in custody. However, many of the matters that determine their classification, designation and non-association status are unlikely to change and are beyond their control. This is partly because, as Farhad Qaumi put it in evidence, “I’m at war”. [85] 
	
	
	Fourth, where the offender’s conditions of custody result from their own misconduct while in custody, the offender cannot rely on those conditions to any significant degree. For example, if the offender has committed acts of violence towards other inmates and this causes them to be held in segregation, the offender cannot be heard to complain or expect any reduction in sentence as a result of those conditions. [86] 
	
	
	Fifth, “there is no automatic conclusion or formula to be applied in the absence of evidence in a particular case”. [87]  In fact, there is no automatic conclusion or formula at all. Each case must be determined on its own facts. It is a matter that may be taken into account but it does not result in some mathematical reduction in an otherwise appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that the conditions of incarceration would only be taken into account as a “special circumstance” justifying a small reduction in the length of the non-parole period. [88]  According to the Crown’s submission, this meant that if I determined to impose a life sentence, the matter could not be taken into account at all. [89]  When this proposition was tested by taking an extreme example, the Crown maintained that the conditions in which an offender was to be incarcerated was “not a relevant consideration” in determining whether a life sentence under s 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act should be imposed. [90]  As I said in the course of the argument, I am unable to accept that submission. I will explain my approach to s 61(1) later in this judgment. In any event, the submission that the matter is only (or predominantly) relevant to the assessment of the non-parole period is contrary to the judgment of Howie J in Durocher-Yvon at [20]:
	


“Although the question in that case [was] concerned with whether there should have been a finding of special circumstances, the same considerations seem to me to apply to the question of whether the head sentence should be reduced.”


	
	I accept that the conditions in which each of the offenders has been held is harsh, perhaps unduly so. They have extremely limited opportunity to interact with other prisoners, are kept locked in their cells for extended periods, have little or no access to education and employment and are accommodated in small cells with very limited opportunity to access outside space.
	
	
	The reason for this is twofold, and perhaps in Jamil Qaumi’s case threefold. First, the offenders are classified as “high risk management” prisoners. This is the result of the number and nature of their criminal offending. While this is a matter within the province of the prison authorities, I accept Senior Counsel’s submission that there is element of “double punishment” at play. Second, they have been placed on the highest form of protection. This is partially because the offenders are “at war” [with the BFL Bankstown] and because they are perceived to represent a danger to other inmates and to the good order of the prison. It is not, as Senior Counsel for Mumtaz put it, a matter of “management expediency”. [91]  However, it is also because the authorities are concerned for the safety of the offenders themselves and because there are limited places where they can safely be accommodated. It is not because of any malevolent act of the offenders committed since they were taken into custody. While not perfect, the offenders’ disciplinary records since going into custody are not terrible (although since writing this part of the judgment it has emerged that Jamil Qaumi assaulted some prisoner officers). The third reason is that Jamil Qaumi’s lawyers requested that he be kept at Silverwater (MRRC) in order to facilitate visits during the currency of the criminal proceedings.
	


Resolution


	
	I accept it is appropriate to take into account the conditions of custody that have prevailed while the offenders have been on remand. It is not possible to determine how long into the future these conditions, or similar conditions, will prevail although I accept the submission that their status as high-risk management prisoners is unlikely “to change any time soon”. [92]  Accordingly, I propose to give the matter some weight in the assessment of an appropriate sentence. In the case of Jamil Qaumi, it is one matter that I consider on the question of whether there are “special circumstances” warranting an adjustment of the non-parole period. In the case of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi, it is a factor, albeit a minor factor in the scheme of things, in determining the question of whether a life sentence is warranted in accordance with the terms of s 61(1). It will be important not to “double count” the matter as a “special circumstance” if it is taken into account in determining the total sentence.
	


SENTENCE for jamil qaumi


	
	I turn to the sentence to be imposed on Jamil Qaumi.
	
	
	In almost every case, the Crown has submitted that it is appropriate to impose the maximum penalty. [93]  This submission did not distinguish between the offenders and, rarely, the offences.
	
	
	For example, the Crown submitted it would be open to impose the maximum penalty on all offenders in relation to the offence of conspiracy to murder Mahmoud Hamzy. [94]  However, in relation to that offence there is a strong, objective and mitigating feature inherent in the jury’s verdicts. That conspiracy was entered in circumstances where each of the offenders believed it was necessary to kill Mohammed Hamzy in order to protect the life of Farhad Qaumi. The jury asked a question in the course of its deliberation as to whether the law of self-defence applicable to murder applied to this count. [95]  The answer was “no”. [96]  This question must be considered in the light of the verdict on count 1 in which the jury did not find the first limb of self-defence negatived beyond reasonable doubt. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the Court would be justified in imposing the maximum penalty.
	
	
	In relation to the shooting offences at the Odisho and Zakaria homes, while the suggestion of self-defence was untenable, I do accept on balance that the offenders were motivated to a degree by their fear that members of the BFL Bankstown were motivated to seek revenge on them for the Hamzy shooting. That shooting, it must be recalled, occurred in the context that the BFL Blacktown had information that there was a plot to kill Farhad Qaumi. The same cannot be said of the Chokolatta Café shooting. There was nothing that would justify that shooting, even in the eyes of those who carried it out. Farhad himself had excluded the target, Abu-Mahmoud, from the “hit list”.
	
	
	In the case of Jamil Qaumi, his subjective case is such that he is not an appropriate vehicle for the imposition of the maximum penalty. He was only 21 years old at the time of the offending. He had a minimal criminal history, was newlywed and was acting under the influence of, and for the protection of his older brother, Farhad. His experience of an earlier drive-by shooting in which Farhad was targeted created the kind of paranoid response described by the psychologist and his sister. [97] 
	
	
	Even accepting all of those things and giving them a great deal of weight, the individual indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence imposed must reflect the wanton lawlessness and callousness in Jamil Qaumi’s outlandish behaviour.
	
	
	As I have said, I intend to impose separate sentences for the three contempt charges and accumulate upon those sentences an aggregate sentence for those offences in relation to which Jamil Qaumi was found guilty by the jury.
	
	
	To comply with relevant statutory provisions and case law following Muldrock v The Queen, it is necessary to do two things before proceeding to sentence. I must indicate whether those offences carrying a standard non-parole period fall within the middle range of objective seriousness and must provide an indicative sentence in relation to each of the offences.
	



	
	In relation to count 1, the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy, taking into account the matters on the Form 1 and a discount of around 10% for the offer to plead guilty, I indicate a sentence of 12½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, grievous bodily harm of Omar Ajaj, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 3, conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 4, soliciting the murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, the attempted murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 7, soliciting the murder of Masood Zakaria, the offence in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 9, grievous bodily harm of H with intent, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicated a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 10, soliciting the murder of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud, the offence is at, or just above, the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 11, the attempted murder of Abudul Abu-Mahmoud, the offence is at, or just above, the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 13, the attempted murder of Khalil Khalil, the offence is at, or just above, the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 15, the attempted murder of Hassan Soueid, the offence is at, or just above, the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 20, the large commercial supply of drugs, the offence is well below the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years. This is the same indicative sentence in the case of Witness L. [98] 
	
	
	In relation to count 21, the possession of the Mossberg sawnoff shotgun, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 22, the possession of the 0.38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole of 3 years
	
	
	In relation to count 23, directing the activities of a criminal group, I indicate a sentence of 2 years.
	



	
	Jamil Qaumi:
	



	
	For the offence of contempt of court on 23 August 2016, you are sentenced to a fixed term of 4 months commencing on 7 December 2013 and concluding on 6 April 2014.
	
	
	For the offence of contempt of court on 24 August 2016, you are sentence to a fixed term of 4 months. That sentence will be wholly concurrent with the first charge of contempt and will commence on 7 December 2013 and conclude on 6 April 2014.
	
	
	For the offence of contempt of court on 14 October 2016, you are sentenced to a fixed term of 8 months commencing 7 April 2014 and concluding on 6 December 2014. I do not propose to fix a non-parole period due to the aggregate sentence I am about to impose.
	
	
	For the offences in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22 and 23 on the indictment you are sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 30 years. Pursuant to s 44(2B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I find special circumstances in the accumulation, your youth, your conditions of incarceration and the desirability that you have incentive to behave well in custody and the benefit of a long period on parole to assist you to re-integrate into the community. Accordingly, there will be a non-parole period of 21 years commencing 7 December 2014 and concluding on 6 December 2035 with a balance of parole of 9 years commencing 7 December 2035 and concluding 6 December 2044. You will be eligible for release on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.
	



	
	Jamil Qaumi, I am required to inform you that the Crime (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 applies to a number of the offences for which you have been sentenced. I will leave it to you lawyers to explain what that means and how it may impact upon your release at the end of the sentences I have just pronounced.
	
	
	Mr Jamil Qaumi can be removed from the dock. Thank you.
	


SentenceS OF life imprisonment


	
	Both Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi face the possibility of a sentence of life imprisonment following their conviction for the murder of Joseph Antoun. The application of the relevant statutory provisions is not without complexity.
	
	
	Section 19A of the Crimes Act provides that the maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder is to serve that sentence for the term of their natural life. Since the abolition of the death penalty, this is the most severe penalty contemplated under Australian law. It should only be imposed in the extreme circumstances provided for by the law. It has a capacity to crush hope and kill any motivation an offender may have to reform. It is considered by some societies and some tribunals to be inhumane and contrary to human rights. [99]  However, it is part of the law of New South Wales and must be imposed in extreme cases. The relevant statutory provision reflects this.
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act provides:
	


“61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	The first thing to note about the section is that the imposition of a life sentence is mandatory if the court is satisfied of the statutory prerequisite that “the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition” of a life sentence. The second thing to note is the importance of the use of the word “only” within that statutory requirement. If any other sentence will meet the community interest in the four matters referred to, that other sentence – and not a life sentence – should be imposed.
	
	
	Section 61(3) provides “nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21(1)”. Section 21(1) preserves the Court’s discretion to impose a penalty less than the maximum even in cases where the offender is liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.
	
	
	In Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Adams and Latham JJ agreed) said that the operation of s 61(1) and s 21(1) required a “two stage approach” stating at [23]:
	


“23   Firstly, consideration is given to whether the objective gravity of the offence brings it within the worst class of case and then consideration is given to whether the subjective circumstances of the offender require a lesser sentence: R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466; R v Valera [2002] NSWCCA 50.”


	
	The High Court recently criticized the use of phrases such as “worst category” and held that the “better approach is for the court to clearly record whether the offence is, or is not, so grave as to warrant the imposition of the maximum penalty.” [100]  The High Court has criticised two stage sentencing in other contexts. Many of the cases describing this two stage process were decided before the High Court made its decision in Muldrock v The Queen.
	
	
	The “two stage approach” was employed in cases such as R v Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276 at [204]; R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19 at [37]; and Dean v R [2015] NSWCCA 307 at [73]. In Miles Stein JA described the two-stage process at [52]:
	


“The first question is whether the level of culpability is so extreme as to warrant the imposition of a life term? Secondly, whether the subjective features are capable of displacing the need to impose the maximum term?”


	
	Some of the authorities recognise that a tension exists between s 61(1) and s 61(3). [101]  In Dean v R their Honours said (at [95]) that:
	


“Certainly, the tension recognised in the authorities as existing between s 61(1) and s 61(3) can only readily be reconciled by assuming that that there has been a determination that a life sentence is required to be imposed and then asking whether, in the circumstances, nevertheless a lesser (fixed term) sentence is appropriate. In other words, there must first be an assessment that the level of culpability is such that a life sentence is required, having regard to the four indicia specified in s 61(1), before one can sensibly apply s 21(1).”


	
	Similarly, in R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19 Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing) noted at [36] the tension between the apparent mandatory requirement to impose a life sentence where a case falls within s 61(1) and the preservation by s 61(3) of the s 21(1) discretion to impose a lesser sentence.
	
	
	There is debate as to whether the two-stage process is the correct approach. I doubt that it is. The case of Dean v R was subject to an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. [102]  It was submitted that the two stage approach is wrong and that the “two sections have to sit alongside each other” with s 21(1) merely preserving the court’s discretion in sentencing. While the application was refused on the facts of that case, Bell J commented: [103] 
	


“We would not wish to be taken to be endorsing everything stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining this matter.”


	
	That comment is rather (and, no doubt, deliberately) opaque. It is axiomatic that the observations of the High Court in granting or refusing special leave do not constitute binding precedent. However, the statements of the High Court in cases such as Markarian v The Queen, Muldrock v The Queen and most recently in Kilic v The Queen, satisfy me that the correct approach does not involve a two stage process. I do not consider the earlier judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal suggesting otherwise are binding in the sense that they mandate that a two stage approach is necessary.
	
	
	The correct approach to s 61 is for the sentencing judge to consider all of the evidence relevant to the sentencing discretion, apply the relevant sentencing principles (common law and statute) and make an assessment of the extremity of the offender’s culpability and the “community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence.” The sentencing Judge must consider whether the only way that the community interest so identified can be met is by the imposition of a life sentence. This is not a multi-stage process. Rather, it is an intuitive evaluation of the all of the material and principles and an application of the legislation providing for mandatory life sentences.
	
	
	In R v Adams (No 7), Button J identified a number of features of cases that have attracted life sentences. [104]  These included cases of multiple murders, cases featuring “some exceptional heinous act of cruelty, torture or mutilation” and, relevantly, “a cold blooded contract killing.”
	
	
	The Antoun murder fits squarely into the last category identified by Button J. However, there have been cases of contract killings where life sentences were not imposed. [105]  To those cases can be added R v NK (No 3), Mr Antoun’s actual assassin (Witness L). In that case, I indicated a putative starting point of 35 years. The sentence imposed on Witness L is also relevant to the question of parity.
	
	
	None of those cases are completely comparable to the present case and the assistance that can be gleaned by other sentencing outcomes is limited. Each case must turn on its own facts. There are very few (if any) examples of cases involving a contract killing taking place in the aftermath of a spate of shootings arising out of a gangland war. Equally, the kinds of matters raised in the subjective cases are unusual.
	
	
	One question that arose in the course of submissions was whether the offender’s criminal history, and the fact that they stand to be sentenced for other grave offences, can properly inform the operation of s 61(1). Senior Counsel submitted that those matters could not be taken into account and that to do so would be to elevate the criminality of the particular offence attracting a life sentence. [106]  I am unable to accept this submission. I accept that the earlier offences (whether they be part of the criminal history or matters in which guilt was determined by the jury) do not impact on an assessment of the objective criminality of the Antoun murder. However, in assessing the “community interest” for the purpose of s 61, they are relevant in particular (but not only) in terms of the community interest in “community protection”. The submission advanced appears to be at odds with the submission that subjective matters (such as Farhad’s post-traumatic stress disorder and Mumtaz’s anxiety disorder) can properly be taken into account under s 61(1) in a one stage, intuitive process.
	
	
	For the sake of transparency, I make it clear that I have taken all matters into account in making the decisions under s 61(1) in each case. I have not elevated or aggravated the assessment of the objective criminality of the Antoun murder by reference to the earlier offences. Section 61(1) is only engaged by reference to the extremity of “the level of culpability in the commission of the offence”. However, I have taken those matters into account in deciding whether the community interest in the four identified purposes of punishment can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence. Equally, in making that assessment, I have taken into account the psychiatric evidence, the evidence of the offender’s dislocated and traumatic childhood and other matters favourable to the offenders. Another important consideration is the imposition of a determinate sentence (with an indicative starting point of 35 years) on the shooter, Witness L.
	


sentencing mumtaz qaumi


	
	I am not satisfied that the maximum penalty is appropriate for any of the offences charged against Mumtaz Qaumi. In relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun, and in spite of the extreme level of culpability, I am not satisfied the only sentence capable of meeting the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence, is a sentence of life imprisonment. My reasons for these conclusions revolve around the offender’s subjective case, the details of which I have set out in a little detail in the course of this judgment. He has a wife and infant children who remain supportive and he is not without some hope for rehabilitation. Also, it is relevant in reaching the determination under s 61 that the shooter was sentenced to a determinate sentence. That raises a question of equal justice and proportionality. For those reasons, I am not satisfied that a life sentence is mandatory and I propose to impose a determinate sentence. However, the reality is that the length of the aggregate sentence that must be imposed may ultimately prove to be an effective life sentence. [107]  The sentence that I will impose will mean that he will not be eligible for release to parole until he is in his mid-sixties. But the sentence will provide Mumtaz Qaumi with some hope that he may be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I will adopt the same approach to the contempt charge as I did with Jamil Qaumi. However, the charge arising from the attack on the co-accused will attract a longer fixed term because Mumtaz Qaumi was the instigator of that ugly incident.
	
	
	Again, before I impose sentence, I am required to make findings as to whether the offences carrying a standard non-parole period fall in the middle range of objective seriousness and to indicate the sentences that would be imposed for each offence if an aggregate sentence was not imposed. For the most part, the indicative sentences are similar to those imposed on Jamil Qaumi. Some of the sentences are slightly longer for reasons that are apparent from the things I have said in the judgment. In the case of the Zakaria shooting, the indicative sentence is shorter because of the lesser role played by Mumtaz Qaumi in the lead up to that shooting.
	



	
	In relation to count 1, the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy, I indicate a sentence of 12 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, grievous bodily harm of Omar Ajaj, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 3, conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 4, soliciting the murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, the attempted murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 9, grievous bodily harm of H with intent, the offence is in the middle of range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 10, soliciting the murder of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 11, the attempted murder of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 13, the attempted murder of Khalil Khalil, the offence is just above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 15, the attempted murder of Hassan Soueid, the offence is just above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 18, aggravated shooting at a dwelling house, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 20, the large commercial supply of drugs, the offence is well below the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years.
	
	
	In relation to count 21, the possession of the Mossberg sawnoff shotgun, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 22, the possession of the 0.38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole of 3 years
	
	
	In relation to count 23, directing the activities of a criminal group, I indicate a sentence of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun, the offence is well above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 38 years with a non-parole period 26 years. The length of the non-parole period reflects the finding of special circumstances I have made in determining the appropriate aggregate sentence. The total sentence is three years more than the indicative starting point for Witness L.
	



	
	Mumtaz Qaumi, I will now impose sentence:
	



	
	For the offence of contempt of court on 14 October 2016, you are sentenced to a fixed term of 10 months commencing 9 February 2014 and expiring on 8 December 2014. I do not propose to fix a non-parole period due to the aggregate sentence I am about to impose.
	
	
	For the murder of Joseph Antoun and the offences in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23 on the indictment before the jury, you are sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 50 years. I find special circumstances under s 44(2B) in your prospects of rehabilitation, your young family, the desirability that you have incentive to behave well in custody and the benefit of a long period on parole in which to re-integrate into the community. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of 36 years to commence on 9 December 2014 and to expire on 8 December 2050 with a balance of term of 14 years to commence on 9 December 2050 and to expire on 8 December 2064. You will be eligible for release on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.
	



	
	Mumtaz Qaumi, I am required to inform you that the Crime (High Risk Offenders) Act applies to a number of the offences for which you have been sentenced. Your lawyers will no doubt explain the implications of that.
	
	
	Mr Mumtaz Qaumi can be removed from the dock.
	


SENTENCING FARHAD QAUMI


	
	Farhad Qaumi faces sentences in relation to 15 offences. This is less offences than Jamil (18 offences) and Mumtaz (17 offences). He is not charged with any of the contempt offences and was found not guilty (at my direction) of all (10) offences arising out of the Chokolatta Café shooting. However, as I have already said, principles of proportionality mean that his brothers must receive a less severe sentence than Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	There are several reasons for this. The first is the fact that his criminal history is worse. However, the main distinguishing feature is the role Farhad played in the group. The evidence given by various of the informants, and some of the recordings tendered in evidence, leaves no doubt that Farhad was the undisputed, and feared, leader of the BFL Blacktown. It was his decision to organise the attempted assassination of Mohammed Hamzy and his decision to target a number of other members of the BFL Bankstown in the aftermath of that shooting. There seems to be little doubt that Farhad’s reputation for violence, and his capacity to direct others to carry out shootings on his behalf, is what led those plotting against Joseph Antoun to approach the BFL Blacktown. It was Farhad who was feted (and then shot at) on the Oscar II motor vessel. It was Farhad who Les Elias and Pasquale Barbaro socialised with in the aftermath of the Antoun murder. More often than not, he used others to do his bidding. This included his young cousin (Witness K), his twenty one year old brother (Jamil) and the young and vulnerable Witness D. Some of the evidence established that he also had Mumtaz making calls and organising things on his behalf. This included the attempts toward the end of 2013 to obtain the bag containing the drugs subject of count 20 and the guns subject of counts 21 and 22. There was evidence that he aspired to “take over Sydney”. While there was an element of grandiosity in such statements, it is clear that Farhad Qaumi’s ambition was to expand his criminal empire, the core businesses of which were the distribution of drugs, extortion and, upon his acceptance of the contract to kill Joseph Antoun, contract killing.
	
	
	As I evaluate the material, and putting aside (as I must) the philosophical question of whether such a sentence should ever be imposed, there are three matters that militate against the imposition of a life sentence. First, Farhad’s personal history of dislocation and trauma as a child growing up in war torn Afghanistan, explains to a very large degree how he came to resort with such apparent readiness to violence, and in particular gun violence. Second, the imposition of determinate sentences on Mumtaz Qaumi and Witness L may give rise to unreasonable disparity if a life sentence is imposed on Farhad. Third, the evidence of the harsh conditions of custody, and the absence of evidence that these are likely to be ameliorated in the near future, means that a life sentence will weigh more heavily upon this particular offender. I have considered those three matters closely along with the extreme culpability involved in the cold blooded murder of Joseph Antoun for money.
	
	
	The history of trauma and its psychological impact on the offender cuts two ways in the present case. While it may diminish the weight to be afforded to general deterrence and impact on an assessment of moral culpability, it heightens the need for the protection of the community. There is no evidence before the Court that would justify a finding that Farhad Qaumi has any reasonable prospect of rehabilitation in the short term. However, the kind of determinate sentence that would be imposed would involve a total term that would not expire until he is in his late eighties or early nineties and a non-parole period that would not expire until he was in his mid to late seventies. Whether he is released at that time, and under what conditions of parole, would turn on an assessment of the danger he represented to the community. For those reasons, while recognising the danger to the community that Farhad currently represents, I satisfied that the community interest in the protection of the community can be met by an extremely long determinate sentence.
	
	
	As to the question of parity, the different criminal histories and Farhad Qaumi’s leadership role are significant differences that justify a far greater sentence than that imposed on his co-accused. However, the fact that both the shooter and Mumtaz Qaumi were sentenced to determinate sentences is a matter that militates against a finding that the only way the community interest can be met is by the imposition of a life sentence.
	
	
	The conditions of incarceration are a matter of concern but the evidence on that subject is such that it is impossible to predict how far into the future his incarceration will remain as onerous as it is today. As I have said, I give the matter some weight but I am not satisfied that this mater, by itself, would result in a finding that the prerequisites in section 61 are not satisfied.
	
	
	Against those matters, I have considered the criminal history of the offender, the spate of earlier shootings in relation to which his guilt was determined by the jury in November last year and the extreme criminality involved in organising the contract killing of another human being.
	
	
	I return to Farhad Qaumi’s personal history. I have already referred to this but I should revisit it to explain the decision to which I have come. The evidence of his mother and sister corroborates the history in Dr Eagle’s report. The history was largely consistent with the material described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1998. He was exposed to extraordinary trauma as a child growing up in Afghanistan. Not many people living in the comfort of Australia could have any real comprehension of this. His school was bombed and his teacher and best friend were killed. The family fled the violence, lived for a while as refugees in India and ended up in Australia. However, his father (himself traumatised by events in Afghanistan) was violent, hitting his oldest son with a belt or a wire. I have no doubt that these experiences had a major impact on Farhad Qaumi’s development and desensitised him to violence. I accept Dr Eagle’s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and that his “experience of trauma has altered his perspective of the world, such that he sees the world as an unsafe and terrifying place.” I accept Dr Eagle’s opinion that:
	


“This has resulted in persistent feelings of fear and anger that have resulted in hyper-vigilance and aggression. In order to avoid these feelings, he has used substances. The trajectory of his life suggests that, as a result of his experiences, he appears to have become caught in a cycle of violence and criminal behaviour.”


	
	In Bugmy v The Queen, the High Court recognised that “social disadvantage … frequently … precedes the commission of crime.” [108]  The same must be true of the kind of exposure to war, violence and dislocation suffered by Farhad Qaumi. These matters, and their psychiatric impact, diminish the offender’s culpability. [109]  It is relevant to an assessment of the “level of culpability” referred to in s 61(1).
	
	
	In spite of the extreme nature of the criminality involved in the killing of Mr Antoun – considered along with Farhad’s criminal history, leadership of a violent criminal gang and the spate of shooting offences in 2013 – the personal background, parity issue and conditions of incarceration, satisfy me that imposing a sentence of life imprisonment is not the only way that the community interest can be met. However, the determinate aggregate sentence that will be imposed will mean that he will be around 75 years of age before he is even eligible for release to parole. At that time, he will only be released if it is determined that he no longer represents a danger to the community. I am conscious that this may represent an effective life sentence, and have made a slight adjustment to the non-parole period as a result, but the criminality is such that no lesser aggregate sentence or non-parole period can be justified. [110]  I am satisfied that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met by the aggregate sentence that I will presently impose.
	
	
	For the purpose of the application of the standard non-parole, it is again necessary to record my assessment of where each offence falls relative to the putative “middle range of seriousness”. Because of his leadership role, Farhad Qaumi’s criminality is higher than that of his brothers in each offence. This is reflected in the individual sentences and in the aggregate sentence. I am required to indicate the putative or indicative sentences that would be imposed if an aggregate sentence was not imposed:
	



	
	In relation to count 1, the manslaughter of Mahmoud Hamzy, I indicate a sentence of 14 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, grievous bodily harm of Omar Ajaj, the case is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 3, conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy, the offence falls in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years
	
	
	In relation to count 4, soliciting the murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, the attempted murder of Michael Odisho, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 7, soliciting the murder of Masood Zakaria, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 9, grievous bodily harm of H with intent, the offence is well above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 18, aggravated firing at a dwelling house, the offence is above the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 19, possession of a 0.45 calibre pistol, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 20, supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, the case falls below the middle range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.
	
	
	In relation to count 21, possession of a Mossberg sawn off shotgun, the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 22, possession of a 0.38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver, the case is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 23, directing the activities of a criminal group, I indicate a sentence of 8 years.
	
	
	In relation to count 2 on the second indictment, the possession of a 0.38 snub nose revolver, the offence is in, or just above, the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4½ years.
	
	
	In relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun, the sentence is well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I indicate a sentence of 45 years with a non-parole period of 33 years and 9 months.
	



	
	I find special circumstances in the fact that by the expiration of the non-parole period, the offender will be in his mid to late seventies and that a failure to make some slight adjustment will convert a determinate sentence into an effective life sentence. I have reduced the non-parole period by only 2 years. I have concluded that the totality of criminality cannot result in an aggregate non-parole period of any shorter duration. The length of the aggregate balance of parole is ample to foster Farhad Qaumi’s reintegration into the community if the relevant authorities allow him to be released on parole.
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi, for all of these offences you are sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 60 years. There will be an aggregate non-parole period of 43 years commencing on 9 January 2014 and expiring on 8 January 2057. There will be a balance of term of 17 years commencing 9 January 2057 and expiring on 8 January 2074.
	
	
	You will become eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I am required to inform you that the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act applies to a number of the offences for which you have been sentenced.

The offence  alleged  arose out of  events  connected with 
the  sale  by  tender  of  the  shoppmg complex  in the  Australlan 
Capital  Terrltory  known  as  the  Belconnen  Mall.  The applicant, 
having  srrlved  in  Canberra  on  27  November  1985, 
was arrested  on 

the  following  day  shortly  after he had  lodged a tender  for  the 

purchase  of  the  complex. 

A  record was  made on  video  tape of 

the  applicant  upon  his  arrival  at  Canberra  airport,  of  some 

proceedings  rn  Mr  Hedley's  office  on 28 November  1985  when  the 

applicant  was  present, of  the  counting  of  money  in the  offlce 

of  the  second  respondent  on the  afternoon  of  that  day, and  of 

the  opening  of  the  tender  box.

monitor  conversations  taklng  place  therein  and  to  record  those 

conversations  on  audlo  tape.  Mr  Hedley  wore 

a transmltting 
device  when  meeting with the applicant  and  further  recordings 

were  made  on  audio  tape  from  that  source.  Other  transmitting 

devices  were  placed  in 

Mr  Hedley's  office  and  in  the  motor 

vehicle  used  by  him.  By  these  means,  material  was  recorded  on 
21  audio  tapes, 6  being  described as large  master  tapes  and  the

were  prepared  progressively  by  typists listening to  the  tapes. 
Detective  Senior  Sergeant  Phillips  began  the  task  of  verifying 
their  accuracy  on 25  February  1986.  The task  of  endeavourlng 
to  produce  reliable  transcripts  progressed  intermittently 

between  that  date  and  July  or  August  1986.  Some 

of  the 

transcripts  were  checked  not  only  by  Detective  Senior  Sergeant 

Phillips  but  also  by  Mr  Hedley,  Mr  Hedley's  recollection  being 
that  he  checked  some  transcripts  in  March  or  April  1986. 

Detective  Senlor  Sergeant  Phillips  also  transcribed  what  was 
recorded  on  some  of  the 15 cassettes whlch had  their  origin  in

that a  decision  would  be  made  ""qulte  soon"" as to  when they 

would  be  released  to  the  appllcant's  legal  advisers. 
According  to  Mr Norman,  %he  Dlrector's  attitude was that  the

in  any  greater  detail  what  was  in  fact  delivered. 

On 5  August 1986  Andersons  wrote  to  the  Director

previous  requests, 

both written  and 

oral, for  material.

Concern  was  expressed  that  it  had  not  been  provided.

Mr  Loftus'  diary no telephone  call  was  received. 

The Director  addressed a letter  dated 7  August 1986 

to Andersons as follows:

Mr  Purnell  of  Counsel  approached 
briefly  in  the  Supreme  Court  on  Frlday  1 August 
and  asked  for  the  tapes  and  transcripts  that  day 
as apparently  a conference  was  to  be  held  with 
the  defendant  sometime  this week.  He  sald  he 
would appreciate  it if this  could be done.  He 
was  advised  that  Mr  Lalor  would  see  what  the 
positlon  was.  Mr  Bradfield  of  my  office  made 
enquiries  and  left a message  with  Messrs  Crowley 
&  Camberlain that  the  tapes  were  being  copied by 
Detective  Sergeant  Phillips  for you  and  that he 
had  advised  that  this  would  take  approximately 
one  more  week. 
I can  only  repeat  that I do not  intend  supplying 
you with  the  information  requested  in your former 
agent's  letters  but  that 
transcripts  when  they have been  finally  verified. 
When  you indicate  that  you intend  taking  'such 
action as may  be  advised'  should you not  receive 
what you  have  requested  by 12  August I can only 
assume  that  you  Intend  making an application  such 
as  was  made

On  11  August  1986  Mr  Bradfield  telephoned  Mr  Loftus

Andersons  wrote  to  the  Director  on  14 August  1986 

as  follows: 

“We refer to our  letter  to you of 5th August  1986

We  are  informed  by  our  Canberra  agents, Crowley

delivered  by  you to  their  office  on the  evening

Police  and  the  D.P.P.)  and  that no  other  tapes

On  2 2   August  1986  Andersons  wrote  to  the  first 

respondent  glving  notice  that  on 

4  September  1986  the 

applicant  would  ""apply  to  the  Court  for  a  stay  of  the  above

the  Defendant  and  that  he  is  being  denied  natural  justice"". 
It  was  further  stated  that,  in  the  alternative,  the 
applicant  would  apply  for a stay  of  proceedlngs  for so  long 
as the  informant  or the  Director  failed  to  provide  to  the 
applicant's  legal  advisers  the  following:

transcrlpts  and  documents  are  provlded  forthwith  to  the

Notlce  of  the  proposed  application  was  given  to  the 

Director  by  letter 
contamed the  followlng  paragraphs: 

of  the  same  date.  ""hat  letter  also 

of  the  7th 
""We  have  considered  your  letter 
August, 1986.  The submlsslon you intend to  make 
which 1s  outlined  in  the  flrst  paragraph of your 
letter  does  not,  in  our  opinlon,  justify  the 
course  that  you have adopted  in  failing to  make 
available  the  materlal  which 
we  have  sought. 
Without  it  we  are  unable  to  properly  advise  Mr 
Emanuele or  conduct  his  defence.  The suggestlon 
that  a  committal  hearing  can  properly  be 
his advisers 
conducted  for  a  defendant  without 
having a  proper  opportunity  to  consider  well  in 
advance  the  material we have  sought  is  untenable. 
In any  event  the  decision  as to  whether  or not 
the  proceedings  wlll  take  the form of a committal 
is not  a matter for  you. 

You have  provided us  with  approxmately 48 copy 
audio  tapes  but  only  one  transcript.  Apart  from 
the  fact  that  this  step has put the  defendant  to 
extraordinary  expense  and  inconvenience  it  does 
not  enable  us  to  check  the  transcripts  on which 
the  prosecution  will  seek  to  rely. 
We  do not 
accept  that  the  prosecution  is  not, at this  point 
of time,  in possession of  any  other  transcripts 
or  unable  to  provide  them. We again  request  that 
transcripts  of  tapes  relevant  to  this  matter, 
whether  video or audio, be  provided  forthwith. 

We  further  request  that  the  material  and 
documents  detailed  in  our  letter  to  the  Chief 
Magistrate  be  provided  forthwith."" 

Subsequently,  by  letter  dated 2  September 1986, the  Director 
was  informed  that  the  letter  was  lncorrect  in  stating  that

k  one  transcrlpt  had  been  provlded. The letter  stated  that no 

transcrlpts  had  in  fact  been  supplied. 

On 4 September  1986  the  flrst  respondent  commenced 

to  hear  the application foreshadowed  In  the  letter  dated 2 2  
August 1986.  At  the  concluslon  of  the  hearing on that  date 
of certain  prellmlnary Issues, the  first  respondent  reserved 

his decision. 

Durmg the  hearing,  the  Director  Informed  the  first 

respondent  that  48  sound  tapes  had  been  made  available  to 
the  applicant’s  legal  advisers  on  1 2  August  1986.  He also 
stated  that  his  office  had  received

the  material”. 

The Director  further  said  that  it  was 

proposed,  in  order  to  facilitate  the  hearing  of  the  matter, 

to give the  defence an opportunity  before  the  hearing  to  see 

the  Crown  brief  generally.

The  hearing  of  the 

appllcatlon  for a  stay  of 

proceedings  resumed  on  24  September 1986 and  contlnued  on 
the followlng  day.  Oral  evldence  was  glven on behalf of  the 

applicant  by  Superintendent  Dau,  Detectlve  Senlor  Sergeant 

Philllps, Mr  Hedley, Mr  Norman  and  Mr  Loftus.  No  evidence 

was  adduced  on  behalf  of  the  second  respondent.  At  the 

conclusion  of  the  hearing  the  first  respondent  reserved his 

declsion. 

During  the  course  of submissions,  counsel  for  the 

second  respondent  explained  that  the  reference  in  the 
Director's  letter  dated  16  September  1986  to the transcripts 
being  provided ""on  the  understanding  that  nothing  will at a 

later  time  be  made  of any  imperfections""  was intended  only 

to  indicate  that  the  Director  was  not  vouching  for  their 

accuracy. 

Also  durlng  the  course  of submissions,  the first 

respondent  requested  to be informed  if,  before he announced 

his  decision  upon  the  application,  the  Director  made  a 
transcript  of any  of the  tapes  available to the applicant's 
legal  advisers. 

The Director  wrote  to  Crowley &  Chamberlain  letters 

dated 9  and 22  October 1986.  The first of  those  letters

On 4  November 1986  the  first  respondent  gave  his 
decision,  dismissing  the  application  for an indefinite  stay 

of  the  proceedings. 

As all  the  material  sought  by  the 

applicant's  legal  advisers  had  by  that  time  been  made

The  flrst  respondent  clearly  acted 

that  the  granting  of 

an  lndeflnite  stay 

on  the  basis 
of  crlmlnal 

proceedings  was  a  serlous  matter,

In  reaching  his conclusion  to  refuse  a  stay,  the

Although  the  first  respondent  consldered  that  the

the  Australian  Federal  Police or  the  Director's  Offlce  and 

although he was  critical  of  the  way  in which  the  case  had so

do,  that  there  had  been 
a  deliberate  withholdmg  of  the

Having  referred  in  detail  to  the  decision,  it  is 

convenient  to  consider  the  objectlon

Nor,  in my  opinion,  does  it

Judicial  Review  Act. 

In any  event, I am  not  satisfied  that  the  making of 

a  decision  by  the  Maglstrates  Court  to  stay  committal 
proceedings  either  for a tlme  or  indefinitely  lncontestably 
has the  hallmarks  of  an exercise  of  a judicial  function so

as  to  take  it  out  of  the  category  of

would be that  the  hearing  of  the  committal  proceedings  could 
not  continue,  the  decision  would  not  declare  or  determine 

existing  rights  conclusively  or  otherwise. 

In my  opinion,  the  objection  to  competency,  in so 

far as  it  rests  on the  proposition  that  the  decision  the 
sub~ect of review  is  not  a  decision  of  an administrative 

character,  fails. 

The  other  ground of objection  to  the  competency of 

the  application 

is  that  the  decision 

1s  not  properly 

described as  a  declsion  ""under an  enactment"".  That  ground 
of ob~ection identified  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Magistrate's 

Court  to  order  the indefmite stay  of  criminal  proceedings,

If it be  true  to  say  that  the  Magistrates  Court  was

purpose  of  protecting  its 

function as a  court  constituted 

with  the  llmlted  jurlsdlction  conferred  upon  it  by  the 

relevant  legislatlve  provlsions,  that  power  inheres  in  it 

because  of  its  creation as a court  by  the  Maqistrates  Court

by  necessary

declslon  falls  outside  the  class of  decisions  to  which  the 
Judiclal  Review  Act  applies.  The question is whether, as a 
matter of  substance,  the  decision has  a sufficiently  close 
connection  with  the  legislative  provision  to  make  it 
appropriate  to  speak of  it as having  been  made ""under"" that 

provision  in  the  sense  in  which  that  word was understood  in

enactment  within  the  meaning  of  that  expression 

definition  of  ""decislon  to  which  this  Act  applies""  in

The sufficiently 

close  connection  arises  because  the  power 

to  make  the 

decision has its  source  in  the  provisions of the  Maqistrates

was put  on  behalf  of  the  appllcant,  although  presented  in

whether  there  had  been  an abuse  of process  in  failing  to

obtainlng an order of  renew in respect of the  decision but 
to refer  to  the  absence of a summons as  one  of  the  matters

no foundation  for

decision  was a  matter  whlch  was  clearly  relevant.  Whatever 
its  relevance may have been  to  the  primary  relief  sought,  it 

was  clearly  relevant  to  the  alternative  claim  that  the 

proceedings  should  be  stayed  until  the  material  was 

provlded. 

The  first  respondent's  reference  to  the 

circumstance  that  much  of  the  material 

which  had  been 

produced  would  not  form  part  of  the  prosecution  case  and 
would,  indeed,  be  inadmissible was, so it seems  to  me,  made 
in  order  to  dismiss  it 

as providmg  any  answer  to  the 

appllcant's  complaint  that  the  material 
provided.  The  first  respondent  acknowledged  in 

had  not  been 

his oral 

reasons  that  the  applicant's  legal  advisers  ""may well have 
wished  access  to  it  to  prepare""  the  defence. So considered, 

it  provides no ground for the  relief now sought. 

Similarly,  the  reference  to  the  involvement of  the 

was  not  for  the 

applicant  in  the  recorded  conversations 
purpose  of  relying on that  circumstance as affording a basis 
as  a factor  in 
for  non  production 
evaluating  the  degree of  prejudice which  the  applicant  had 
suffered  by the delay  until  1 2  August  1986 in producing  the 
tapes  of  those  conversations.  Again, this  provides no basis 
for the applicant's  contention  that  the  power was improperly 

of  the  material  but 

exercised.

conclusion  that  there  is no substance  in  the  submission  that 
the  first  respondent  failed  to  take  into  account  the 

relevant  facts.  Those  facts  included 

all  that  was 

relevantly  said,  either  orally  or  in  the  correspondence,  by 
or  on  behalf  of  the  Director  and  the  second  respondent.  It 

is  clear  that  the  first  respondent,  although  critical  of  the 

conduct  of  those  involved 
prosecutlon  case,  did  not  conslder  that  that  conduct 

in  the  preparation  of  the 

amounted  to  such an abuse  of  process as to  warrant the  step 

of  staying  the  prosecution  indefinitely. 

With  this 

conclusion  the  applicant  disagrees  and  the  submissions,  as 

formulated,  contain  elements  of  wilfulness  and  deliberate 
conduct  that  the  first  respondent  clearly  did not  embrace. 
They  were  matters  for him, not  for  this  Court,  unless  it  can 

be shown  that,  in  arriving  at  his  conclusion, 
renewable  error.  It  is  apparent  from  the  reasons  for 

he fell  into  a 

decision  that  the  first  respondent  had  well  in  mind  the 

whole of  the  conduct  on which  the  applicant  relied,  that he 
took  it  into  account,  giving  it  such  weight  as he  thought 

appropriate,  in  balancing  the  conflicting  interests  which 

he 

clearly  recognised  and  articulated. 

To  establish  reviewable  error  the  applicant 

contended  that  the  exercise  of  the  power 

was  manifestly 

unreasonable.  It  was  said  that  the  only  inference  open 

on 

the  material  was that  there  had  been  an abuse  of  process 

arising  either  by  deliberate  design  or  by  reason  of gross 
and  that  an

There  is  no  doubt,  on  the  evidence,  that  the 

applicant's  legal  advisers  were  given  to  understand  by  the

No tapes 

It cannot  be  gainsaid  that  copies  of all the  tapes 

were  available  to  the  police, at the  latest,  by  the  end of 

February 1986.  In the  absence of  any  explanation,  one  can 

only  conclude  that  a  decision  could,  and  should,  have  been 

made  early  in  1986  whether  coples  of  the  tapes  (at least 
those  recording  conversations  to  which  the  applicant  was a 

party)  were  to  be  made  available  to  the  defence.  Once  the 

decision  was  made,  whether  acceding  to  the  request  or 

otherwise,  the  applicant's  legal  advisers  should  have been 

informed  promptly of  it.  It provides no answer to say that,

head.

provided  until  verified as being as accurate as the  quality 
of  the  recording  would allow 1 s   understandable.  However,  If 
the  transcripts  were  to  be  made  available, and the  Dlrector 
indicated  in  his submissions  to  the  first  respondent  on 4 
September  1986  that they  were,  there  seems  no  reason why, 
and  none  has  been  advanced,  they  could  not have been  made 
available  progressively  as verification  proceeded.  In  any 
event, the Director could  have  been much more informative in 
what he was  saying  to  the  appllcant's  legal  advisers. 

A  further  factor of significance  is  the  finding  by 

the  first  respondent  that  the  failure 

to  provide  the 

materlal  had  resulted  in  prejudice  to  the  applicant  in  the 
preparation  of his defence.  It  must  be  noted, however, that 
the  finding  falls  far  short 

contention  made  by 

of  the 

counsel  for  the  applicant  that  the  applicant  had  been 

irretrievably  hindered  in  the  preparation  of  his  case  and 

that  the  uncontradicted  evidence  was  to  that  effect.  Not 
only  does  this  contention go beyond  the  first  respondent's 
finding but it is  not  supported  by  the  evidence. 

But  to  conclude  that  there  was  delay 

and indecision 

on the  part  of  those  having  the  conduct  of  the  prosecution 
case  does  not  require  the  conclusion  that  the  decision  not
--------

4 4 .  

to stay  the  prosecution  indefinltely  was an exercise of  the 
power so  unreasonable  that no reasonable  person  could  have 
so exercised  it. 
The questions  which  the  first respondent 
posed,  and 

view  rlghtly,  were  whether  what  had 

in  my 

occurred  amounted  to an abuse of  process and, if so, whether 
the  abuse  was  such  as  to  warrant  the  exercise  of  the  power. 

It  is  clear  that  the  first  respondent  gave  anxious 

conslderation  to  both  these  questlons  and  particularly  to 

the  balancing  process  which  the  second  questlon  required. 

In the  result,  he  answered  both  questions  adversely  to  the 

applicant.  Having  reviewed  the  whole  of  the  materlal  and 
considered  the  submissions  put  to  me, I am  satisfied  that 
this  ground  of  challenge to  the  decision has not  been  made 

out.  Indeed,  having  regard  to  the  serious  nature  of  the 

offence  charged,  it  may  well  be  said  that,  giving  full 
weight  to  the  crlticism  which  can  properly be made of those 

responsible  for  the  prosecution, 
proceedings  indefinltely  would  not

It was  also  submltted  on behalf  of  the  applicant 

that  the  first  respondent  had  erred  in law in two respects. 

First,  it  was  said  that 

he  misinterpreted  the 

authorities  and  applled  too  stringent a test in  holding  that 
it  is  only  in a rare  case  that a court  will  take  the  extreme 

step of grantmg  an indefinlte  stay of criminal  proceedings 

on  the  ground  of abuse  of  process.  It 

was  submitted  that
--------

the  first  respondent's  approach  to  the  question  was  that  the 

power,  In  effect,  was  one  that  he  would  never  exercise. 

Reference  was  made  to  the  other  expresslons  used  by  the 
first  respondent  In  this  regard,  expressions  to  which  I  have 
already  adverted. 

In  discussing  this  aspect of  the  matter  the  first 
respondent  cited  the  following  passage from the judgment  of 
Cox J.  in  The  Oueen v.  Vuckov  and  Romeo  (1986) 40 S.A.S.R.

The first  respondent  also  referred  to  Connelly  v.  Director

the  normal  processes  of  the  crlminal

not  be  completed  and  would  not run their  normal

Later he said: 

""It  would  require  the  abuse  of  process  to  be 
clear  and  extremely  serlous  before

I  should 

In my  opinion  these  passages from  the  decision do 

not  demonstrate  any  misconception  of  the  authorities  or  any 
error  of  law. 

The authorities  are  consistent  in  their 

emphasis  that a  clear,  compelling  and  exceptlonal  case  must 

be  shown  to  warrant  the  exercise  of what is categorised as 
an extraordinary  power,  a power  of  last  resort  the  exercise 
of  which  is  necessary  in  the  particular  circumstances  in 

order  to  serve  the  ends  of  justice.

14879,6024242,R v Rhodes [2017] NSWSC 694,"Judgment


	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to, and is to be sentenced for, a series of offences which occurred on 8 September 2015. On the evening of that day he murdered his mother and a young close-relative in the home they shared with other young relatives; he then assaulted a passer-by, damaging her car; and when police arrived to arrest him he assaulted one of them while resisting arrest. The four crimes of personal violence are separate counts on the indictment on which he was arraigned. The offender has asked that the property damage and other resist arrest offending be taken into account on a Form 1 when he is dealt with on the first murder charge.
	
	
	The second murder victim was a child of 8 years. Two other residents of the home in and about which the offending occurred were, and are, also children. Both have made family victim impact statements. Both were witnesses to and affected by the extreme violence inflicted upon the murder victims.
	
	
	Under s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) the names of the children must not be published or broadcast in a way that connects them with these proceedings. This prohibition does not apply to an official report of court proceedings: s 15B. As has been done in other proceedings (see, for example, R v Maybir (No 8) [2016] NSWSC 166 and DL v R [2017] NSWCCA 57) out of respect for his memory and to accord him appropriate dignity, I will refer to the young murder victim by his given name Braydon. For similar reasons, that is to say, respecting them as persons and properly acknowledging what they have suffered, I will refer to the other children involved by their given names, Taylor and Ireland.
	


Circumstances


	
	Around the time of the offending, the offender had been residing in his mother’s home. She was then 63 years of age. Without disrespect, I will refer to her by her given name of Linda. Linda had the full-time care of three young relatives: Braydon, Taylor and Ireland. Another young relative, Hayley, who was 19, also resided in the home.
	
	
	It is relevant to record that the offender had spent a good part of the day, though it is difficult to be precise, drinking, playing poker machines and smoking the illegal drugs cannabis and methylamphetamine, better known as ice. Some of this took place at the home of his brother where he had been just before returning to his mother’s home at around 11:00pm. Hayley first saw the offender that night when she was leaving the bathroom after a shower. He said to her, “we’re going to have some fun tonight”. Hayley dismissed that observation with the teenager’s “whatever”. She went to her bedroom.
	


The death of Linda


	
	About five minutes later she heard Linda screaming “Hayley”. Hayley left her room and hurried to the lounge room which she found to be in darkness. When she turned on the light she saw Linda on the lounge cowering from the offender who was standing over her with a knife in his right hand. Hayley screamed the offender’s name and said, “What’s wrong?” He replied “They’re in the house, they’re in the house”. Hayley said, “Who’s in the house?” The offender said, “Don’t worry; I’ll get rid of them.” Hayley ran from the house to find help.
	
	
	Ireland came out of her bedroom and saw Linda standing at the front door in fear. The offender was pacing “back and forth” saying, “This is it … you’re a goner”. Ireland’s recollection is that the offender then went to the kitchen, removed a large cook’s knife from a drawer and took it to Ireland’s bedroom. He then emerged from the bedroom, walking to the door and swinging the knife saying, apparently to Linda, “If you come in the house you’ll cop it”. He was swearing at Linda, denigrating her. Linda said, “Please don’t”.
	
	
	When Hayley arrived at the neighbour’s home where she went for help, she stopped and turned. Looking back at her home she saw Linda standing at the foot of the front steps. The offender was at the top with the knife, and looking down at Linda. The neighbours took Hayley into their home, from which they immediately telephoned the police on triple-0.
	
	
	Ireland had followed the offender out of the house screaming “get off her, get away from her”, trying to protect Linda. The offender turned and looked at Ireland. I have no doubt his look was menacing for Ireland then attempted to hide in the bushes in the garden. Linda had been saying to the offender, “What’s wrong, what’s wrong”. I infer she was receiving no answer. She attempted to flee to the neighbour’s home. As she did so, the offender gave chase. He overtook her just as she was entering the neighbour’s yard and stabbed her initially in the back. Swinging her around, he stabbed her again. Linda continued to try to get away, but collapsed. The offender continued his attack, repeatedly striking her, while she was on the ground.
	
	
	As Linda lay helpless on the ground, the offender picked up a concrete statue, which was found to weigh around 28 kilograms. He repeatedly threw the statue down on Linda’s head, smashing her skull.
	
	
	Linda died as a result of the massive head injuries inflicted by the offender with the concrete statue. One of the stab wounds also perforated the right ventricle of her heart.
	


The death of Braydon


	
	Having murdered his mother in this way, the offender re-entered the family home.
	
	
	Taylor, who had been asleep, was awakened by the sounds of Linda’s screams. She woke Braydon and they looked for somewhere to hide in the bedroom. There was nowhere to hide so they sat on a couch in the lounge room, I infer hoping not to be noticed by the offender.
	
	
	After re-entering the home, the offender went to the kitchen. Taylor heard the sound of him rummaging through drawers. He re-entered the lounge room, carrying what she described as a two-pronged knife. He approached the children saying, “If you move, talk or speak, I am going to stab you with this knife”. He held the knife up for them to see. He then grabbed Braydon by the neck of his T-shirt and stabbed him in the chest with the tip of the knife. Braydon cried out pleading with the offender “please … please, don’t hurt me”. The offender repeatedly smashed Braydon’s head against the wall. Braydon managed to escape the offender’s clutches, fleeing the home with the offender in pursuit.
	
	
	The offender overtook Braydon, causing him to fall to the ground. He then repeatedly bludgeoned Braydon’s head with a sandstone flagstone he lifted from the garden.
	
	
	Braydon died as a result of this massive blunt force trauma. He suffered multiple fractures of his skull and facial bones, and a really serious traumatic brain injury. The other stab wounds were relatively superficial and did not contribute to death. There can be no doubt that he suffered multiple forceful traumatic injuries to his head. The offender was heard to say “Die, just fucking die. I don’t care.”
	
	
	While the offender chased Braydon, Taylor was able to escape from the house. Jumping the fence she was able to enter the neighbour’s yard from where Hayley quickly pulled her inside.
	
	
	After his ferocious attack on Braydon the offender was seen to be pacing “back and forth” at the front of the home. Around this time another neighbour also rang triple-0.
	


The assault on Annabelle Saludo


	
	Annabelle Saludo had been visiting a nearby home. Leaving, she walked to her car parked in its driveway. She noticed the offender two doors away. He began running towards her in a menacing fashion, and she became afraid. She quickly entered her car, locked the door and turned on the ignition.
	
	
	When the offender arrived she could see that he had blood on his hands. He was hitting the window of the driver’s door yelling “fuck you, fucking open up”. He walked around the car trying the doors. Ms Saludo blew the horn, trying to attract help. The offender walked to the front of the car, putting his hands on the bonnet, screaming and swearing at Ms Saludo. She reversed the car out of the driveway with the offender running after her. As she halted to put the car into drive, the offender stood in her way attempting to lift the car. He moved away and she was able to drive off with the offender giving chase.
	
	
	Ms Saludo saw an approaching police car which stopped and she reported what had happened to Senior Constable Steve Lewis. Apart from the fear the offender had instilled in Ms Saludo, she suffered chest pain and shortness of breath, I infer due to her anxiety.
	


Snr. Const. Lewis


	
	When Snr. Const. Lewis arrived at the home, he saw the offender standing in the street. Doubtless Snr. Const. Lewis had information that had been provided through the triple-0 operators. He got out of his car and approached the offender asking, “Where’s the knife, have you still got it?” The offender strode towards the police officer saying, “Yeah I do”. Snr. Const. Lewis yelled, “Put the knife down, get rid of the knife”. The offender continued his advance, picking up a fibro-cement meter cover. He challenged Snr. Const. Lewis by saying, “Let’s go”.
	
	
	Snr. Const. Lewis drew his Taser and pointed it at the now shirtless offender, who was “covered in blood”. Snr. Const. Lewis commanded the offender to halt, but the offender continued his advance holding the meter cover out like a shield. The officer fired at him, but the Taser misfired. The offender continued to advance and the officer backed away, drawing the offender towards him. The officer fired again and again the Taser misfired.
	
	
	Snr. Const. Lewis could hear approaching police sirens. Prudently, in the circumstances, he continued to avoid engaging with the offender. Just as police back-up arrived, the offender lunged at the officer. As Snr. Const. Lewis sought to fend him off, they both fell to the ground, grappling with each other. The back-up officers arriving on the scene were pulling the offender away from Snr. Const. Lewis. It was necessary to spray the offender with oleoresin capsicum spray to subdue him. The offender continued resisting arrest by struggling with the officers. It was only after he had been handcuffed that it became apparent that he was then unarmed.
	
	
	Investigating police scoured the area and came across Linda’s body only two metres from the front door of her neighbour’s home. She was lying face up. Braydon’s body was found near a tree in the front yard of Linda’s home, a short distance from the front steps.
	
	
	The offender was arrested and taken to Blacktown Police Station where after speaking with lawyers he participated to some extent in an electronically recorded interview. He asserted he was “insane” and in need of help. He said his memory was a complete blank between leaving his brother’s place and being handcuffed by police.
	


Relative maximum sentences


	
	In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the Court is required to bear in mind, where applicable, two legislative guideposts. The first, which applies to all offences, is the maximum penalty fixed by Parliament. The second, which applies only to offences for which Parliament has prescribed a standard non-parole period, is that standard non-parole period. Murder is a standard non-parole period offence.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life (s 19A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act)), but the court is empowered to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term instead where appropriate: s 21 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act). Under s 61 Sentencing Act, it will not be appropriate “if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition” of a life sentence. Accepting that this is a decision for me alone, the Crown have submitted that, bad as this case is, it is not such a case.
	
	
	For the murder of a child under 18 years of age, like Braydon, the standard non-parole period is 25 years. In other cases, like Linda’s case, it is 20 years: see Part 4, Div 1A Table Sentencing Act.
	
	
	For the offending against Ms Saludo, the offender has pleaded guilty to the offence of common assault, carrying a maximum penalty of 2 years’ imprisonment: s 61 Crimes Act. For assaulting Snr. Const. Lewis in the execution of his duty the maximum penalty is 5 years’ imprisonment: s 60(1) Crimes Act.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	As part of the consideration of the full range of facts, matters and circumstances which bear upon a decision about the appropriate sentence, it is necessary to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. This is especially so for the offence of murder, and for other standard non-parole period offences. The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence that is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offending of that type. Of this assessment, the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v the Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at 132 [27] said:
	


“Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.”

This passage is to be read in conjunction with s 54A Sentencing Act.


	
	Objective seriousness is not the same as moral culpability which, necessarily, takes into account personal characteristics of the offender. Bearing in mind that there are four offences and that for the murder of Linda there are two other offences to be taken into account on the Form 1, there are clearly objective factors common to each offence. Indeed, this offending involves a quite shocking sequence of events occurring within the confines of an overall episode of grave criminality.
	


The murder of Linda


	
	Dealing first with the murder of Linda, the circumstances are clearly very grave. They include the sustained infliction of extreme violence involving the use of weapons; a knife with which to stab her, and an improvised bludgeon with which to shatter her skull. There can be no doubt, it is not disputed, and I infer from the level of violence involved, that the offender intended by his actions to kill.
	
	
	The offending occurred in Linda’s home where she was entitled to feel secure. It matters not that the final fatal blows were struck in the yard of the adjoining premises. The offender killed Linda in the presence of Ireland and Taylor, who were children. The offending involved the abuse of a position of trust in relation to Linda. The offender is her son and a member of her household. Although she was not old, one would expect a mother could rely upon her adult son to provide protection from harm. She was also vulnerable, especially in her prone position when the final blows were struck.
	
	
	As the facts I have recounted also show, death was inflicted in a sustained persistent attack. I accept that there was little or no premeditation and that the offending commenced impulsively. But the offender persisted with it. Even if one characterises the attack as the product of a sudden explosion of rage, or as very largely spontaneous, it was accompanied by a determination to go on with it. I accept that given the ongoing nature of the attack, Linda would have been conscious of the offender’s determination to kill her. I accept the submission that while still conscious she is very likely to have been terrified and full of the apprehension of impending death.
	
	
	The consideration that Linda’s death was inflicted as part of what the Crown correctly describe as a violent rampage in which more than one victim was killed and others were harmed is a factor which greatly aggravates each individual offence: s 21A(2)(m) Sentencing Act.
	
	
	It is also necessary to take account of the consideration that the offender has a history of domestic violence offending against his mother. On 5 October 2007, he was convicted of the offence of destroying or damaging her property. The facts involved an attempt to obtain prescription drugs from his mother. When she refused there was a dispute during which he punched and damaged the laundry door. He threw a chair at his mother which she had to duck to avoid, but it damaged the gyprock wall. He also threw a bottle at her.
	
	
	Following that offending, an apprehended violence order was put in place for his mother’s protection. On 31 August 2011, he threw a telephone at his mother in the course of a dispute. On 1 October 2011, in the course of an argument involving the offender’s then girlfriend and his mother, the offender grabbed his mother and threw her forcibly to the ground, winding her. On 30 May 2013, again during the course of a domestic argument he pushed her into a wall. When Linda left the house to get away from him, the offender commenced to smash Linda’s crockery. These matters are relevant because they bespeak an ongoing degree of aggression directed at Linda by the offender.
	
	
	As I have said, I am satisfied that this is grave offending. To the extent to which it is necessary to specify, I accept the Crown’s submission that the offending involved is well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	


The murder of Braydon


	
	Without in any way eliding the separate offending involved in the murder of Linda with the murder of Braydon, many of the factors to which I have referred in relation to Linda’s murder apply equally to Braydon’s murder. By briefly recapping them I should not be taken as indicating that they are any less serious in his case. Indeed, it should be said at the outset that the murder of a child is always treated as an offence of gravity, which Mr Bruce SC who appears for the offender accepts. He did, however, seek to distinguish this case from those involving ongoing violence perpetrated on a victim over a period of time. I acknowledge that distinction.
	
	
	However, as with Linda, Braydon was a victim of extreme violence motivated by an intention to kill. The killing was perpetrated in a sustained attack as part of a series of offending carried out in Braydon’s own home. There was an element of cruelty to this offending, in as much as the offender used the double pronged knife to inflict pain of a non-fatal kind and he beat Braydon’s head against the wall. Braydon would have known that the offender was intending to kill him and like Linda, he would have been terrified in his final moments of life. As I have said, bludgeoning him with flagstone involved extreme violence. It should not be overlooked that the crime was perpetrated in the face of Braydon’s plaintive pleas for mercy. Once again, the objective seriousness of this offending is very high and well above the mid-range.
	


Ms Saludo


	
	Ms Saludo was obviously terrified by the offender’s attack. The assault against her consisted of deliberate actions which engendered great apprehension of injury in her. She was an entirely innocent passer-by and the offending against her occurred at least partially in a public place, illustrating the risk that the offender then posed to public safety. This is an objectively significant case of common assault.
	


Assault of Snr. Const. Lewis


	
	It needs to be borne in mind that it is an element of this offence that Snr. Const. Lewis is a police officer acting in the execution of his duty. In other offences that would be an aggravating consideration, but it cannot be treated as such in this case.
	
	
	However, the objective circumstances are obviously serious for this offence. The offender advanced on an officer who was keeping his distance and attempting to contain him until back-up arrived. The offender armed himself with the meter cover. The offender continued to advance even as Snr. Const. Lewis tactically withdrew. When back-up was imminent, the offender lunged at Snr. Const. Lewis causing them both to fall to the ground. The offender continued to grapple with Snr. Const. Lewis even as other officers attempted to remove and restrain him. Again, the offence against Snr. Const. Lewis was part of a series of serious criminal offending. Objectively, I would regard this as a significant example of this kind of offending.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	A relevant factor informing the objective seriousness of the offending I have so far not referred to is the extent of the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence: s 21A(2)(g) Sentencing Act. It is trite to say that in a murder case, it is an element of the offence that the actions of the offender caused the victim’s death. However, in every case of murder, as in this case, the harm extends beyond the death of the immediate victim to the losses suffered by the victim’s family as a result of the victim’s death. In this case also, as my findings of fact illustrate, other occupants of Linda’s home who were related to her were witnesses to the extreme violence perpetrated by the offender. I refer to Hayley, Ireland and Taylor.
	
	
	It must be taken and acknowledged that they have been greatly traumatised not only by the death of Linda and of Braydon, but also by their direct exposure to the violence and the peril they were placed in during the offender’s rampage.
	
	
	I have received victim impact statements from each of them and also from Linda’s other son William and her daughter Tina. I have also received a victim impact statement from Linda’s neighbours, Jeffrey and Shanye-Marie who were friends of the family. They were also exposed to the “horror” of the events of that night. They gave sanctuary to Hayley and Taylor and it was in their home that Linda had sought refuge before being overtaken by the offender, as I have recounted.
	
	
	I listened attentively to each of the statements as they were read in court and I have re-read them during the time taken for consideration of the case. Each of them is very moving and the suffering of each of the authors was not lost on me. I consider it appropriate to accede to the prosecutor’s application that I take their content into account in connection with the determination of the punishment of the offender on the basis that the loss suffered by the family is an aspect of the harm done to the community by the offender’s offending.
	
	
	I offer the Court’s condolences to the family. I appreciate that all will be permanently affected by these crimes.
	


Mitigating circumstances


	
	There are four disputed issues among the offender’s personal circumstances said to operate as mitigating factors which I am required to decide. They are as follows:
	



	
	Whether the offender was suffering from an intellectual disability such that his moral culpability is reduced and the need for specific and general deterrence is lessened;
	
	
	Whether the evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the offender’s childhood was one of profound deprivation such as to engage the principles discussed in Bugmy v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 571; [2013] HCA 37;
	
	
	The extent to which he was intoxicated at the time and its relevance for sentencing purposes. In particular, did he act in the grip of a drug-induced psychosis?
	
	
	Whether a discount should be allowed for the early plea, and if so, the extent of it;
	



	
	These matters of course are interrelated and they are not the only potentially mitigating matters which may be relevant in the present case.
	


The offender’s upbringing


	
	As I have previously stated, the offender was 35 years of age at the date of the offending and is now 36. He is a man of Aboriginal heritage. He does not appear to have been in a stable ongoing domestic relationship at the time of the offending and he has no children.
	
	
	He is the son of Linda and William who met at high school and remained together until the offender reached 14 years of age. It is not in issue that William was a drunken and abusive father. His physical abuse was mostly directed towards Linda, but his children, including the offender, were also primary victims. The offender recalls witnessing domestic violence in the home from about the age of 6. Police were sometimes called. This violence continued until William left the family when the offender was about 14 years old. This was precipitated by the offender standing up to his father, confronting him, fighting him, and getting the better of him in that fight, breaking two of his ribs.
	
	
	The offender did not give this evidence, but it is part of the account he gave to his solicitor who affirmed an affidavit in the proceedings. I am prepared to accept the account is probably true. The offender said that his mother did not use alcohol or drugs and did her best to shield him and his siblings from their father, including sending the offender away to live with his grandmother from time to time.
	
	
	He attended public schools in Sydney’s north-west region until year 9. He apparently struggled at school, having difficulty learning and was suspected of suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This diagnosis was not made in his childhood and he was not prescribed stimulant medication when at school. He reports being illiterate, and I note his sister says she suffers the same disadvantage. The offender’s learning difficulties may be related to his dyslexia of which there is apparently a family history.
	
	
	The offender’s account of the difficulties of his upbringing were largely corroborated by an account given to a neuropsychologist, Dr Hepner, by the offender’s maternal aunt and for that reason it may be more readily accepted. I record here, however, that I would not regard the aunt’s answer to Dr Hepner’s question about whether the offender had ever been diagnosed with an intellectual disability as being answered affirmatively by the response “Yes, he was diagnosed with everything”. His aunt confirmed that there was a family history of dyslexia apparently.
	
	
	My impression from the histories given to the various experts who examined the offender for the purpose of these proceedings is that he had, at best, a chequered employment history. He most recently worked as a glazier’s assistant, perhaps on a casual basis, from about 2008 to about 2015. He was unemployed and living at home again at the time of the offending.
	


Substance abuse


	
	The offender’s history of substance abuse seems to start with smoking cannabis from the age of 15 years and has continued up until the time of the offending. From his late teens he used speed on a daily basis, continuing into his twenties and thirties. He dabbled with heroin in his late twenties and commenced to use the dangerous and destructive drug ice, according to his account, only in the nine months prior to the offending. He believes that ice had a deleterious effect upon him and described himself to Dr Furst, a forensic psychiatrist whose reports of 14 January 2016 and 15 November 2016 are in evidence, as “a paranoid schizophrenic now” as a result of his ice use.
	


Previous medical history


	
	He was also seen by Dr Ilana Hepner, the clinical neuropsychologist whose report of 6 June 2016 is in evidence. Dr Hepner conducted neuro-psychometric testing, to which I will return. She also reviewed the available previous medical records of the offender, at least so far as they were relevant to her task. The records do not contain any evidence of any diagnosis of ADHD as a child, but that condition does seem to have been diagnosed in his adult years by Dr Pickering, a psychiatrist, in September 2008.
	
	
	There are a number of entries related to poly-substance abuse or dependence. Again, these relate to his adult years. There is a history of a head injury in January 2000 after he was assaulted, but a CT scan provided no evidence of acquired brain injury as a result. He was admitted to Blacktown Hospital in 2006 and 2012 for accidental drug overdoses. For the 2006 admission he was found unconscious at home. His score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 out of 15. In August 2013 he apparently completed a detoxification program for alcohol and amphetamines at Concord Hospital. It seems he relapsed.
	
	
	As I have said, Dr Pickering diagnosed ADHD in 2008. Apparently there was a suggestion of cyclothymia or bipolar spectrum disorder at the time, but no definite diagnosis of such a condition then or since. He was referred to a Dr Donna Clarke, psychiatrist, in June 2009 complaining of anxiety and mood swings for which he was self-medicating with substance abuse. His symptoms included periods of feeling out of control and an inability to manage frustration and irritability. Dr Clarke discounted bipolar disorder, favouring a diagnosis of depressive disorder complicated by his substance abuse.
	
	
	I interpolate that since he has been in custody, he has seen psychiatrists with Justice Health a number of times who have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify a diagnosis of mood or psychotic disorder.
	
	
	Notwithstanding his learning difficulties, there was nothing in the pre-existing and contemporaneous clinical records to suggest that the offender had ever been diagnosed with a psychotic illness, or as suffering from an intellectual disability, prior to September 2015. I accept that the absence of prior diagnosis does not conclusively prove the negative.
	


Defence expert evidence about mental state


	
	For the purpose of his report, Dr Furst received the personal and clinical history consistent with that which I have summarised above. He also had access to the Justice Health medical record from which it is apparent to me that at least initially after his arrest the offender was trying to present himself as someone who was “going insane”. He made the same complaint to the police during his interview after his arrest. And to Dr Furst (see [58] above).
	
	
	From Dr Furst’s review of Justice Health’s file, the offender complained of symptoms which may be associated with psychosis such as auditory hallucination including hearing voices, and paranoia or “people talking about him”. He proffered the possibility that he was a paranoid schizophrenic. He was very upset and denied, as he has steadfastly done, any recollection of the offences or any detail of them. Indeed he denied knowledge of being drug-affected which was inconsistent with his account to the police and to others.
	
	
	Having reviewed this material, Dr Furst expressed the following opinion (report dated 14 January 2016 at page 6):
	


“[The offender] has a history of substance abuse dating back to the age of 15 years, unstable temperament, and apparent mood-swings. However, having regard to all of the available history and medical records, there was no convincing evidence that he suffers from a major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder”.


	
	Dr Furst did diagnose substance abuse disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He suspected that the offender may suffer from a personality disorder. That last diagnosis has never been confirmed. In the first report there is no mention of the possibility of Mild Intellectual Disability.
	
	
	Dr Hepner administered what might be called the usual battery of psychometric tests. As I understand her report, many of the test results evinced an overall level of intellectual function in the Extremely Low range. The offender’s overall memory for spoken information was rated in the Borderline-Impaired range and his verbal and non-verbal reasoning skills fell into the Impaired range. However, I do not understand all of the results to have been entirely consistent. For instance, some of the results including those for “speed and flexibility of thinking” were unimpaired, even though rated in the Low Average to Average band within the range of normality. Also, for memory testing, upon repetition of some of the tests, he demonstrated improvement in the ability to retain “lengthy, unstructured spoken material”. Dr Hepner noted “there was no significant loss of information after a distraction or a 20 – 30 minute time delay” (report dated 6 June 2016 at page 8 [15.3]). Although Dr Hepner found that his verbal and non-verbal reasoning skills were in the Impaired range, his approach was reasonably planned and organised. She said (at page 8 [15.4]):
	


“No deficits were evident on measures of visuo-constructional problem solving and speed and flexibility of thinking”.

The offender’s performance on a test of single word reading fell in the Extremely Low range. This is undoubtedly because of his illiteracy.


	
	Dr Hepner assessed the offender’s overall level of intellectual function in the Extremely Low range. This is consistent with a Mild Intellectual Disability. But Dr. Hepner was aware of the history of illiteracy and dyslexia, expressing this opinion:
	


“The impairments detected on testing would be considered consistent with the chronic effects of ADHD, the neurochemical changes associated with the long-term polysubstance abuse and possible hypoxic brain damage due to drug overdose, with some contribution also likely from Mr Rhodes' limited educational attainment. The reported history of multiple brain insults sustained during childhood (i.e., likely repeated traumatic brain injuries sustained at the hands of his father) would lead to poorer overall outcome.” [My emphasis.]


	
	Dr Hepner was of the view that the difficulties in cognition she identified would have affected the offender at the time of the offending. She pointed out that individuals with a history of ADHD and/or acquired brain injury have such deficits in cognition, and behavioural issues including anger management and proneness to impulsivity.
	
	
	Dr Furst prepared his second report of 15 November 2016 with the benefit of Dr Hepner’s report and pharmacological reports about the likely state of the offender’s intoxication at the time of the offending. I will deal with those reports below. Dr Furst confirmed his previous diagnoses of substance abuse disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He also said that Mr Rhodes met the criteria for the diagnosis of acute intoxication (presumably at the time of the offending) and Mild Intellectual Disability. He maintained the opinion that Mr Rhodes did not suffer from a major mental illness. Dr Furst said (at page 6):
	


In my opinion, his cognitive deficits, observed several months after his arrest, are consistent with a mild intellectual disability, equating to severe cognitive deficits seen in the lowest 1st Percentile of the community, and a mental condition/disorder that constitutes an abnormality of mind.


	
	Dr Furst also noted the anecdotal link between intoxication and paranoia. Dr Furst’s conclusion was expressed as follows (at page 7):
	


“In my opinion, [the offender’s] acute intoxication with alcohol and drugs was the primary reason for his paranoid thinking and extreme aggression; however, his underlying cognitive deficits probably made him more vulnerable to paranoia, emotional dysregulation and possible hallucinations, mitigating to some degree against the seriousness of his actions”.


	
	He regarded the offender’s apparent amnesia as consistent with the cumulative effects of intoxication by alcohol, cannabis and ice, inducing a “black out” (at page 7).
	


Pharmacological evidence


	
	Before making findings relevant to the offender’s mental state generally, and at the time of the offending, it is perhaps convenient to review the pharmacological evidence which is in dispute. It is necessary first to set out more of the events of 8 September 2015.
	
	
	As I have indicated, the offender was interviewed by police, after his arrest, at Blacktown Police Station at 3:00am on 9 September 2015. As I have indicated he repeatedly referred to his mental state in that interview. I will not quote at length from the transcript which is in evidence before me, however, among the repeated self-references to his “insanity” are the following:
	



	
	(Page 2 Q and A 15) “I’m just trying to comprehend what … I’m going through … and that’s why I’m pleading insane. That’s … what I wish to say on the matter”;
	
	
	(Page 2 Q and A 18) “I know I’ve clicked it …I’m insane. I need real professional help”;
	
	
	(Page 3 Q and A 19) “I’ve always suffered as a young fellow with mental health”;
	
	
	(Page 3 Q and A 27) “I was in a different world”;
	
	
	(Page 3 Q and A 28) “I clicked it. I’m insane … I need locking away. I need help”;
	
	
	(Page 4 Q and A 29) “Everything was spacey … it was like being in a dark cloud”;
	
	
	(Page 8 Q and A 83) [When asked what he meant by “he clicked it”, he said:] “I lost it. I lost everything. I lost me sanity. I lost, yeah, I lost it. I can’t remember. I shouldn’t drink and take drugs”;
	
	
	(Page 15 Q and A 168) “I went to my brother’s. I blanked out. I was arrested on the footpath and here I am”;
	
	
	(Page 23 Q and A 268) [When asked how ice made him feel, he said:] “Well, it’s never blanked me out before, so I don’t … they say all the ice is different which it is. Depends what chemicals are in it so, yeah, I might have got a bad batch”;
	
	
	(Page 25 Q and A 269) [When asked where the blood on his face came from, he said:] “No … I can’t remember. That’s it. That’s all I wish to say on the matter and I reckon I done pretty good there because I can’t remember and I’m not gunna (sic) incriminate myself”.
	



	
	During the course of the interview he said that he’d arrived at the Lalor Park Hotel by himself around the middle of the day and remained there for two hours or so. He had bought a $50 deal of ice and smoked half of it before going to the hotel. Whilst at the hotel, he drank three or four schooners. He smoked the rest of his ice when he left. He bought a six pack of beer from a bottleshop to take to his brother’s place, which I infer he drank. Whilst at his brother’s place, he smoked “a cone or two” (page 6 Q and A 68) of “pot”. He would normally smoke “eight [or] nine” (page 13 Q and A 136).
	
	
	In her victim impact statement, Ireland said of the offender, I stress not to exculpate him, but to describe what she saw:
	


I don’t really know how to put it, but that night I feel like it wasn’t him. It was like someone else. He came after me and I was looking into his eyes and it just didn’t look like him.


	
	It was not until 10:40am on 9 September 2015, about 12 hours after the offending, that a blood sample was taken from the offender for forensic testing. The results were negative for alcohol and positive for cannabis, amphetamine and methylamphetamine. In his report of 28 January 2016 tendered by the Crown, Mr Farrar, a consultant forensic pharmacologist and fellow of the Australasian College of Biomedical Scientists, expressed the view that it was not possible to make any accurate estimate of the offender’s level of intoxication by alcohol at the time of the offending because by the time the blood test was taken, the alcohol had been fully metabolised and there was insufficient reliable evidence available to make any other assessment. He was of the view that the schooners drunk at the hotel in the afternoon would have metabolised by the time of the offending, but because of the absence of any accurate information about the consumption of the beers from the six pack, no credible opinion could be offered.
	
	
	Mr Farrar was of the view that the offender’s blood-methylamphetamine concentration at the time of the incident was in the range of 0.07 mg/L to 0.15 mg/L: page 7 [37]. The toxicological results for amphetamine reflect its presence as a metabolite of methylamphetamine only. The results for cannabis were not in a range suggestive of the offender being a frequent heavy user. Mr Farrar said that blood concentration levels of THC are not well correlated with levels of cognitive impairment. The blood concentration usually dissipates within 2 to 3 hours of usage.
	
	
	Mr Farrar said that the neurochemical effects of methylamphetamine consumption include “alertness, euphoria, perceptions of indestructability, increased risk-taking activity, enhanced sexual excitement, restlessness, increased aggression, confusion, hallucinations and tremor”: page 6 [34]. The “second phase [of intoxication] is dominated by rebound fatigue and sedation”: page 6 [35].
	
	
	Mr Farrar was of the view that the cannabis consumed by the offender, as described by him to the police, would not have increased any propensity he may have had to commit the offences. The toxicological results suggested that if the offender’s account of when he smoked the ice was accurate, he should have been in the rebound sedative phase when the offending occurred and accordingly ought not to have had any increased propensity to offend.
	
	
	Dr Macdonald Christie, a consultant pharmacologist whose report was tendered by the defence, expressed different opinions from Mr Farrar. Dr Christie broadly agreed with Mr Farrar’s range for blood-methylamphetamine concentration at the time of the offending; agreed it was difficult to estimate the concentration of cannabis at that time, but generally thought that the toxicological results were consistent with offender’s reported pattern of consumption; and agreed it was not possible to reliably estimate blood alcohol concentration because alcohol had been fully metabolised, but thought the account given by the accused indicated “that he was not severely intoxicated by alcohol at the time of the alleged offences”: page 6).
	
	
	While accepting that the toxicological results suggested only possible mild to moderate intoxication by ice at the time of the offending, Dr Christie considered that the possible combination of ice, cannabis and alcohol is “associated with increased likelihood of aggressive and violent behaviour, and disinhibition”: page 6 [4.2]. The expert expressed the view that the offender’s intoxication may have impaired his reasoning and behaviour. He alluded to the possibility of an ice-induced psychosis exacerbated by cannabis use. He said that the “so-called ‘amphetamine psychosis’ [is] characterised by psychotic reactions including delusions, hallucinations and paranoia, and the risk of a psychotic episode increases with dose and duration of use”: page 11. Dr Christie thought it possible that the reported pattern of use of ice over the 9 month period “could have produced a transient psychotic episode”: page 11. He acknowledged the drug produces increased violent behaviour “independently of whether or not it has induced psychotic symptoms”: page 11. In his view the literature supported a synergy of ice and cannabis leading to an increased risk of psychotic symptoms: page 12.
	
	
	He disagreed with Mr Farrar’s assessment that the offender would have been in the rebound-sedative phase at the time of the incident: page 12.
	


Findings about upbringing and mental state


	
	I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the offender had somewhat a deprived and difficult background. This includes the experience at a very young age of the resort to violence in the home as the answer to difficulties and as a salve for frustrations. I accept that he had significant difficulties at school because of his dyslexia and his undiagnosed ADHD. The former must have contributed greatly to his functional illiteracy and the latter leaves him with difficulties in anger management and prone to lash out in a violent way when frustrated. The consequences of his social deprivation probably compound the effects of his ADHD. The proneness to violent outburst, I think, is illustrated by the previous offending I have described above committed against Linda, or in her home.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that he has an acquired brain injury due to either his father’s violent abuse or a loss of consciousness from accidental drug overdose. Leaving aside for the moment the psychometric testing results, there is simply no evidence to support such a finding. In particular, I repeat that the CT scan taken following his admission to hospital for a drug overdose in 2006 did not demonstrate any brain injury.
	
	
	I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that his cognitive impairments are as gross as the psychometric testing results suggest. Nor am I persuaded that he suffers from a Mild Intellectual Disability, appreciating that such a diagnosis, if correct, bespeaks a severe handicap. I am not persuaded because of what I regard as inconsistencies in the psychometric testing that I have described above and the absence of any historic longitudinal and contemporaneous clinical material supporting such a diagnosis from childhood or early adulthood. I appreciate that Dr Hepner was well aware that the offender is functionally illiterate and that there is a family history of dyslexia. But there is nothing in her report explaining how these obvious difficulties for accurate psychometric testing were overcome in her administration of the battery of tests so that accurate, reliable and consistent results could be obtained. With respect, Dr Hepner does not explain nor reconcile the apparent inconsistencies.
	
	
	I acknowledge that Dr Furst, in his second, but not first, report makes the diagnosis of Mild Intellectual Disability. However, it is apparent that this diagnosis is wholly based upon the results of the psychometric testing and can only be as reliable as those test results; as the saying goes, “the spring cannot rise higher than the source”. I also think it telling that there is no suggestion of such a diagnosis in Dr Furst’s first report prepared with the benefit of a mental state assessment of the offender carried out in person over a period of 60 minutes. For what it is worth, there is nothing in the accounts given of himself by the offender which I have read, including the transcript of the ERISP and the medical histories recorded by the experts, which is suggestive of a Mild Intellectual Disability. He seems to have been able to give a coherent and rational account of himself.
	
	
	Dr Christie pointed out that from his viewing of the video recording of the record of interview he:
	


“could not discern any obvious signs of intoxication for methylamphetamine, cannabis or alcohol at that time. His responses to questions were timely and coherent although the speech may have been slightly slurred. His demeanour appeared settled or subdued, without any signs of agitation or aggression throughout the interview” (page 4).


	
	Dr Furst also viewed that video and, having done so, formed the opinion in conjunction with his review of all of the material made available to him “that there were no indications [the offender] suffers from a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affected disorder”. This, of course, does not in terms exclude mild intellectual impairment but there is certainly no suggestion in Dr Furst’s first report of mental retardation by reference to “subaverage general intellectual functioning and significant limitations in adaptive functioning”: Muldrock v The Queen at 137 [50].
	
	
	I fully appreciate that a court ought to be slow to reject uncontradicted expert opinion, and that there is no expert opinion contradicting Dr Furst. However, my view of the facts differs from the assumptions that Dr Furst has made about them. The results of the psychometric testing showed good cognitive functioning, in what I would regard as certain significant areas. There is no evidence of “significant limitations in adaptive functioning”. More importantly, there is no evidence of any lack of capacity in the offender to reason as an ordinary person might as to the wrongfulness of his conduct: Muldrock at 139 [54].
	
	
	On the contrary, I am persuaded that whether or not the offender had a complete blackout of events as claimed, of which I must say I am sceptical, his repeated concern during the interview with the police and with psychiatrists for Justice Health to present himself as a paranoid schizophrenic is consistent with a full understanding of the wrongfulness of his conduct. If this is correct, presenting himself as mentally ill was a device to provide justification for his aberrant behaviour and to reduce the moral culpability otherwise implicit in it. I am not persuaded the principles relevant to sentencing persons with an intellectual disability as discussed in Muldrock have been engaged in this case.
	
	
	At the same time, I am persuaded that the offender’s deprived background including his ADHD, to a degree, explain his recourse to violence when angry. These considerations which are not of his doing tend to, in the circumstances of the case, reduce the offender’s moral culpability somewhat but given the extremity of the violence, not substantially.
	


Ice-induced psychosis


	
	I am also satisfied that at the time of this gross offending, the offender was in the grip of an ice-induced psychosis. I reject Mr Farrar’s evidence that he would have been in the second, rebound sedative phase of ice intoxication. This is simply entirely inconsistent with the facts I have recounted of the offender being in a rampaging rage when the murders were committed. It is much more likely, for the reasons given by Drs Furst and Christie set out above, that he was in the grip of acute intoxication involving psychotic aspects. This conclusion is consistent with what seem to be the bizarre statements the offender made, namely “we’re going to have some fun tonight” to Hayley, and his statement that “they’re in the house … I’ll get rid of them”. It is consistent with Ireland’s description of him. His difficulties with anger management due to his upbringing and ADHD no doubt make him somewhat prone to the aggressive effects of ice.
	
	
	Although the amounts of drugs consumed do not seem great in this case, having regard to the offender’s account and the toxicology results, I accept that the compound effect of them acting on his underlying propensities were sufficient to trigger such a psychosis in this case.
	
	
	It is, of course, fundamental to bear in mind that self-induced intoxication whether by drugs or alcohol is not a matter of mitigation: 21A Sentencing Act. The use of drugs involves personal choice for which an offender should take responsibility. Here the offender had the opportunity to rehabilitate himself from drug use in 2013 at Concord Hospital, but relapsed. An element of choice is also involved in relapsing into drug use.
	
	
	Johnson J discussed legal principles relevant to this question in R v Fang (No 4) [2017] NSWSC 323 at [70] – [81]. I will not set out the passage in full. His Honour pointed out that where the relevant mental condition (i.e. drug-induced psychosis) was itself a transient effect of the person’s use of drugs on the occasion of his offending, as in this case, s 21A (5AA) has application. It is quite clear that an offender’s self-induced intoxication cannot operate to mitigate the circumstances of the offending. It remains, however, that the drug-induced psychosis provides a probable explanation for why the offender offended as he did: R v Henry (1999) 48 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111. Moreover, the circumstances of his upbringing and his condition of ADHD provide a partial explanation for his use of prohibited drugs providing a degree of mitigation, as I have said, and to some extent reducing his moral culpability.
	
	
	I would, however, with respect quote what Johnson J said at [81]:
	


“I am satisfied that general deterrence remains a factor to be taken into account on sentence in this case. The sentence in this case should serve as a warning to the general community, if a further warning was really needed, of the disastrous consequences flowing from the use of Ice and the serious acts of violence which may be undertaken by persons while under its influence including, in this case, murder”.

The significance of the plea of the of guilty


	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, that is, in the Local Court. Section 22 Sentencing Act requires a court passing sentence on an offender to take into account the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, as well as the timing and circumstances of the plea. The court is empowered to impose a lesser penalty than it otherwise would have imposed, provided that the penalty is not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and the circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	However, as the express terms of the legislation and the established practice of the Court demonstrate, there is a category of case when a court is justified in refusing a discount. The prosecution have submitted that this is such a case. Spigelman CJ referred to these matters in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at 418 [157] – [158]. The Chief Justice observed:
	


“There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate.”

Another is where the protection of the public requires a long sentence so that no discount is appropriate.


	
	Mr Bruce SC for the offender argued that this case did not fall into that exceptional category where the court was justified in withholding the usual discount.
	
	
	The allowance of a discount involves an exercise of judicial discretion. There is no right to a discount. I accept that the categories of case in which a discount will be withheld are confined, but they are not closed.
	
	
	It is pertinent to repeat at this time that the Crown have accepted that, bad as the objective circumstances of the offending are, this is not a case which, overall, falls into that worst category of case referred to in s 61 Sentencing Act where the public interest requires the imposition of the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, although this is a matter for me and not for the prosecution. However that may be, a discount may be withheld in an appropriate case, even though the maximum penalty is not imposed.
	
	
	It should be observed that on any view the case against the offender would have been very strong. However, given the psychiatric issues that have arisen, it could not be said that a partial defence of substantial impairment would have been bound to fail, even if it was unlikely to succeed.
	
	
	Quite apart from the usual utilitarian considerations that are involved in allowing a discount for an early plea, the plea in this case, in my view, does involve an actual acceptance of responsibility on the part of the offender.
	
	
	Bad as this offending is, I am not persuaded that it falls into the worst category calling for the imposition of the maximum sentence. Accepting this is not the only circumstance in which a judge would be justified in refusing a discount, I accept that the plea of guilty has served more than one purpose in the circumstances of this case. In addition to its utilitarian value, its signification of the acceptance of responsibility for very serious offending, and the consideration that young witnesses have been spared the necessity to relive the horror of the events persuade me that the usual discount for an early plea of guilty of 25% should be extended in this case.
	


Other relevant circumstances


	
	I accept that there are other mitigating factors, including the consideration that the offence was not planned or premeditated, but arose impulsively. I also accept that the offender has shown remorse. I have accepted that the plea of guilty bespeaks the acceptance of responsibility for his actions. I am prepared to accept that the professions of love for his mother and Braydon he gave to Dr Furst were spontaneous and genuine. Doubtless, this offending would never have occurred but for the psychosis induced by his self-intoxication with a cocktail of substances, including ice. I repeat, the latter consideration does not mitigate the offending, but simply explains it.
	
	
	The offender will of necessity serve a long sentence during which at some stage he will be given the opportunity to undertake courses of rehabilitation addressing his drug and alcohol problem and anger management issues. The length of time necessarily involved makes it difficult to assess his prospects of rehabilitation. He will need to maintain a determination to reform over a long period of time and in trying circumstances. As I have said, I am satisfied that he has accepted responsibility and shown genuine remorse. Expressions of remorse and the acceptance of responsibility together normally presage good prospects of rehabilitation and I am prepared to assume so.
	
	
	Although I have highlighted previous offending involving Linda, there is nothing remotely like the present offending, or even suggestive of the present offending, on the offender’s prior record. This suggests that the terrible events of 8 September 2015 were an aberration. There is a need for punishment proportionate to the gravity of this offending, but I am not persuaded that the offender presents a continuing danger or that the circumstances of the present case enliven a particular need for protection of the community.
	


Sentence


	
	Obviously, and without ignoring the offending involving Ms Saludo and Snr. Const. Lewis, the most powerful consideration relevant to sentencing in this case is the need to recognise that the offender, by his extremely violent conduct, took not one but two human lives, being the life of his mother and that of a close relative of tender years. Adapting the language from the plurality judgment in Munda v Western Australia (2013) 249 CLR 600; [2013] HCA 38, a just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of these victims and the legitimate interests of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of the brutal drug-fuelled destruction of the lives of Linda and Braydon by an offender from whom they were entitled to expect the protection due from a close family member. It is the obligation of the Court to mete out a just punishment for this violent offending.
	
	
	It is also clear that the offender has drug addictions which enhance the relevance of personal deterrence. I have already pointed out that given his circumstances and his ADHD, there is some reduction in his personal moral culpability. Nonetheless, as was pointed out in Munda, drug-induced violence involving death is an example of moral culpability to a very serious degree.
	
	
	All of the facts, matters and circumstances to which I have referred must be brought together in the instinctive synthesis to reach a just sentence. This requires striking a balance of many different and conflicting features relevant to the offending and the offender.
	
	
	In making my decision, I have had regard to the various cases referred to by counsel for my consideration. I have borne in mind, however, that no two cases are truly alike and that the purpose of considering comparative cases is to obtain a yardstick against which the sentence proposed in the case at hand can be measured. However, in no way does the yardstick provide a range within which the case at hand must fall. One matter of principle that arises out of the cases is that personal circumstances justifying a reduction in moral culpability are not inconsistent with the imposition of a stern sentence.
	
	
	I have decided that the interests of justice in this matter will be best served by the imposition of an aggregate sentence. That sentence will reflect a marked degree of notional accumulation of the individual sentences and a degree of notional concurrency. In fixing the aggregate head sentence and non-parole period, I will take into account the principle of totality but I am satisfied that the components of the sentence I will impose are proportionate to the overall gravity of the offending.
	
	
	In imposing an aggregate sentence, I am obliged to indicate the sentences I otherwise would have imposed for each offence taking into account the allowance I have made for the guilty pleas. In the case of the murder of Linda and the murder of Braydon, it is also incumbent upon me to indicate the non-parole period I otherwise would have imposed. This is not required in the case of the assaults on Ms Saludo or Snr. Const. Lewis.
	
	
	In indicating the sentence I otherwise would have imposed for the murder of Linda, as requested I have taken into account the additional criminality represented by the offending on the Form 1. These offences relate to the damage to Ms Saludo’s car and resisting the back-up police at the time of arrest. Without downplaying these matters, it must be said that the criminality they imply in the circumstances of this case pales into relative insignificance.
	
	
	The murder of Linda and the murder of Braydon are serious violence offences to which the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) applies and I am required by law to warn the offender that the provisions of that Act may make him liable to extended detention or supervision after the expiration of the sentence I impose.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence will consist of a non-parole period and an additional term. The non-parole period of a sentence is the minimum time which justice requires the offender to remain in full-time custody. However, it should not be assumed by anyone, least of all the offender, that release at the expiration of the non-parole period is automatic or a foregone conclusion. Release when first eligible for parole depends on the independent decision of the State Parole Authority.
	
	
	The indicative sentences for each count in the indictment are as follows:
	



	
	For the murder of Linda, a term of 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years;
	
	
	For the murder of Braydon, a term of 30 years with a non-parole period of 22 years and 6 months;
	
	
	For the assault on Ms Saludo, a term of 14 months;
	
	
	For the assault on Snr. Const. Lewis, a term of 2 years.
	



	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 8 September 2015 and his sentence will be backdated to commence then.
	
	
	Mr Rhodes, on your plea of guilty, you are convicted of each of the four counts on the indictment. I sentence you to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 40 years with a non-parole period of 30 years. The sentence will date from 8 September 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 7 September 2045, at which time you will first become eligible for release on parole. The total term will expire on 7 September 2055.

        “……. . that I desire to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence pronounced by his Honour Judge Barnett, a judge of the District Court of New South Wales, at the Drug Court on 24 July 2003 when one William John TOMAN appeared for final sentence on charges numbered 1 to 9 hereunder and for sentence on charges numbered 10 and 11 hereunder to all of which charges he had pleaded guilty:

        ON THE GROUND 
         that the said sentence is manifestly inadequate.” 
         
        
       
       
      THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
       
      
    2 The Court is constituted pursuant to s3 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act): 
     
      
       
        
        “3 (1) The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct. “ 
        
       
      
    3 Provision in s6AA of the Act for the hearing of some appeals by two judges is not presently relevant. 
     
      
    4 The right of the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against sentence is vested by s5D(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “5D (1) The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper. “ 
        
       
      
    5 The Crown was a party to the proceedings against the respondent in the Drug Court. It was not suggested that this was not so. The Act has a specific provision relating to appeals from the Drug Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “5AF (1) Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person convicted of an offence by the Drug Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Part 2 of the Drug Court Act 1998 (in relation only to a final sentence determined by the Court under section 12 of that Act) in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA(1). 
        
       
       
        
         (2) For the purposes of this section, a reference in section 5AA to the Supreme Court is to be construed as including a reference to the Drug Court. 
        
       
       
        
         (3) The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under this section is to be exercised by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.” 
        
       
      
    6 Section 5AA is incorporated, as just set out, in s5AF by reference and it makes provision for appeals brought by persons who are convicted or against whom orders have been made. There is no reference in s5AA to appeals by the Crown (brought by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions):  
     
      
       
        
        “5AA (1) A person 
        
       
       
        
         (a) convicted of an offence; or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made, by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (2) For the purposes of this Act, a person acquitted on the ground of mental illness, where mental illness was not set up as a defence by the person, shall be deemed to be a person convicted, and any order to keep the person in custody shall be deemed to be a sentence.” 
        
       
      
    7 Neither Counsel appearing in the present appeal suggested that the Court should be constituted other than in accordance with s3, that is to say, by three judges. Their stance in that regard was correct.  
     
      
    8 The result of the statutory construct is that an appeal from the Drug Court by the prosecution will be heard by a bench of three judges whereas an appeal by an offender will be heard by a single judge as prescribed by s5AF(3).  
     
      
    9 The second reading speech upon the bill which became the Drug Court Act by the Hon R.D. Dyer on behalf of the Attorney General included these references to appeals: 
     
      
       
        
        “There will be no right of appeal from decisions of the Drug Court as to eligibility, treatment option, sanctions, or other program decisions.’ 
        
       
       
        
        ……….. 
        
       
       
        
        The Government makes no apologies for changing the rights and responsibilities of offenders once they enter the program as, amongst other things, the potential benefits to offenders from participation in the program are enormous. Of course, the Drug Court program will allow appeals on sentence. These will be to a single judge of the Supreme Court. Such appeals are rightly retained as they relate more to a person’s due process rights at large than to internal decision made by the Drug Court.” 
        
       
      
    10 The legislation is effective in implementing the stated intentions. Neither the Drug Court Act nor the speech makes reference to appeals against sentence by the Crown. 
     
      
    11 This distinction between constitution of the court to hear an appeal by an offender and an appeal by the Crown in respect of the same (final) sentence might be considered anomalous and, as was indicated at the hearing would be done, it is drawn to attention.  
     
      
       
      THE OFFENCES OF THE RESPONDENT 
       
      
    12 As can be inferred from the terms of the Notice of Appeal, the charges against the respondent can be divided into two categories. The first category (charges 1 to 9) came before the Drug Court (constituted by his Honour Judge Barnett) on 19 December 2002 when the respondent sought admission into a drug program. Sentence was imposed in respect of the nine charges. These sentences were imposed pursuant to s7(2A) of the Drug Court Act 1998 (to which statute unreferenced sections hereafter refer) and were by definition “initial sentences” pursuant to s4(1). A mandatory order for suspension of the sentences was made (s7(3)(b)) upon his Honour’s order that the respondent participate in the relevant program. 
     
      
    13 After appearance at the Drug Court the respondent attended a clinic for the purpose of prescription of some medication and while there he met an acquaintance who gave him two tablets, possibly Rivotril, as a “celebratory gesture”. The respondent ingested the tablets in combination with his medication and he became “blurred”. He did not attend, as required, to enter the program. 
     
      
    14 Some time before midnight on 19 December 2002 the respondent broke and entered premises at Parramatta and stole a bank issued credit card. He went to a shopping centre which, the court was informed, was open overnight for the purpose of Christmas shopping. The respondent presented the card as payment for various purchases but on a final occasion, the store operative noted irregularities and the respondent was taken and held by shopping centre security at about 12 am on 20 December. Police had been contacted and they took the respondent into custody. 
     
      
    15 Investigations also identified the respondent as the perpetrator of breaking entering and stealing at a Granville address. This offence had occurred on 17 July 2001. Charges referrable to those two breaking and entering offences were the subject of a new indictment to which the respondent pleaded guilty. Offences of possessing a housebreaking implement and dishonestly obtaining goods by deception (using the stolen credit card) were taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    16 The second category of offence (charges 10 and 11 in the Director of Public Prosecution’s Notice of Appeal) were the offences on this indictment which was not dealt with in terms of the Drug Court Act. 
     
      
       
       
      INITIAL AND FINAL SENTENCE IN THE DRUG COURT 
       
      
    17 On 9 January 2003 the respondent’s Drug Court program was terminated by Judge Milson (s10(1)(b)). On 24 July 2003 he appeared before Barnett DCJ, who exercised the jurisdiction both of the Drug Court and the District Court, for final sentence in respect of the offences in the first category which I have mentioned and for sentence in respect of those in the second category. 
     
      
    18 In imposing final sentence for the first category the learned judge was bound to apply a prescription in s12(4) namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence.” 
        
       
      
    19 In the circumstances his Honour determined that none of the initial sentences should be reduced and final sentences were imposed in identical terms. Those sentences were therefore imposed at the upper limit of severity permitted by s12(4). 
     
      
       
      THE CROWN APPEAL AGAINST THE SENTENCES AFFECTED BY THE DRUG COURT ACT 
       
      
    20 As recited above, the Notice of Appeal is (in respect of the first category of sentences) exclusively directed to the final sentences. There is no reference to the initial sentences. This Court is, equally with a judge at first instance, bound by the restriction legislated in s12(4). The sentences were the maximum that could be imposed by that Court or by this Court. 
     
      
    21 The possibility of this being the case was raised during the hearing of the appeal and supplementary submission has been received on this aspect from the Crown. It is suggested that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be that the quantum of the initial sentence is not considered appealable but that some aspect of the final sentence, such as the absence of accumulation, is.”  
        
       
      
    22 I do not construe s12(4) so as to enable, by some manipulation of orders relating to of final sentence, an effective increase in the time which an offender will be kept in custody beyond that which would be the consequence of serving what has been specified as the initial sentence.  
     
      
    23 The supplementary submission continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Arguably the Crown could have appealed against that aspect of the sentence at the time it (initial sentence) was imposed. Realistically however the failure to comply had no practical effect because of the inevitable suspension of the sentences. To have appealed at that point is arguably contrary to the purpose of the Drug Court Act and irreconcilable with absence of the offender’s right of appeal against the initial sentence. While it is arguable that the failure to appeal the initial sentence creates an undesirable element of doubt in the offender’s approach to the programme it is fairer that the Crown only appeal once and that the appropriate time to appeal is when all relevant information is available to the Court. The latter position only arises after the imposition of the final sentence”. 
        
       
      
    24 It is true that, if the offender is to be admitted to a program, the initial sentence will inevitably be suspended (s7(3)(b)). The Crown submission was supported by a submission by counsel for the respondent to the extent that it conceded a right of the Crown to appeal against initial sentence in addition to a right to appeal against final sentence. However, it was submitted that where no appeal is brought against that initial sentence, the Crown cannot in an appeal against final sentence seek to impeach the initial sentence. No application was made by the Crown to amend the terms of its Notice of Appeal which, as recited above, was expressed to challenge final sentence. 
     
      
    25 The limitation on appeal by an offender in s5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act restricts challenge to final sentence whereas there is no special provision applicable to a Crown appeal which is brought pursuant to s5D of that Act. It was therefore submitted that there was a discernible approach reflecting “the paramountcy of the final sentence and the largely administrative function of the initial sentence.” 
     
      
    26 Initial sentence is defined as “any sentence imposed on a person in accordance with section 7 or 8AB, and includes any sentence that is added to the initial sentence in accordance with section 8AC” (s4). All of ss7, 8AB and 8AC specify that the person dealt with under those provisions is to be convicted and sentenced in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. See s7(2A), s8AB(3) and s8AC(3). 
     
      
    27 The imposition of initial sentence is an act of judicial character, not of administrative character. 
     
      
    28 There is nowhere to be found any limitation on appeal by the Crown asserting inadequacy of initial sentence and, whilst it is understandable that such may be considered awkward and potentially nugatory having regard to the possibility that an offender will satisfactorily complete the program and be dealt with more leniently when coming for final sentence, s12(4) operates to prevent any increase of final sentence so as to exceed the initial sentence. 
     
      
      THE EFFECTIVE SENTENCES 
       
      
    29 The restriction legislated by s12(4) which applies to offences in the first category does not apply to those in the second.  
     
      
    30 It is necessary however to look at the overall sentences in order to consider the adequacy of those imposed for the second category of offences. 
     
      
    31 Previously, the respondent was sentenced in Sydney District Court to a term of imprisonment of two and half years with a non-parole period of eighteen months dating from 10 April 2001. His parole date was 9 October 2002. On 12 July 2001 he escaped by walking away from a situation of minimum security. He was re-arrested on 25 August 2001. The offences in the first category were the escape and others committed whilst unlawfully at large. He was in custody from 25 August 2001 until 19 December 2002 when Barnett DCJ, sitting as the Drug Court imposed initial sentences, made the order for his admission to a drug programme and suspended those sentences. 
     
      
    32 When appearing for final sentence on 24 July 2003 the initial sentence for the escape was confirmed being imprisonment for six months to date from 23 November 2002 and to expire on 23 May 2003. Save charges 8 and 9, upon which fines had been imposed, the initial sentences, confirmed as final sentences on charges 1 to 5 and charge 7, were directed to commence on 22 May 2003. A parole eligibility date of 21 May 2004 was specified.  
     
      
    33 On charges 10 and 11 (the second category) he was sentenced to four years imprisonment from 22 May 2003 with a non-parole period of twelve months. His parole eligibility date remained unaltered at 21 May 2004. 34 Although, in my view, the Court has no power to intervene to increase the final sentences imposed in respect of the offences in the first category, they remain relevant as part of the extant record of the respondent available to be taken into account in determining whether he may not receive leniency which might otherwise be granted to him. Relevant to that consideration as well are offences on the respondent’s record going back to being dealt with in the Children’s Court in 1993.  
     
      
    35 In assessing the sentences imposed for the second category it was also appropriate to bear in mind the initial sentences (now confirmed as final sentences) in connection with applying the principle conveniently referred to as “totality”.  
     
      
       
      THE FACTS AND SUBJECTIVE MATTERS 
       
      
    36 The facts of the offences in the second category are sketched above. A little elaboration is apt. Shortly prior to midnight on the day he had been given the suspended initial sentences and directed to the drug program by Barnett DCJ, the respondent presented a credit card for payment for some sports shoes at a shop at the Westfield Mall at Parramatta. A call was made to the credit card centre and the respondent was asked to speak to the operator. He did so and was heard to say “Cut up the card”, after which he hung up the telephone and left. He was seen running out exit doors but was detained. On his journey he dropped a screwdriver.  
     
      
    37 Investigations showed the use of the card between 10 and 11 pm to purchase jeans, shirts and a screwdriver. The authorized holder of the card was identified and contacted. The card should have been at her home. Her husband was at the home and at the time awaiting police to whom he had reported an apparent break and enter. The main bedroom sliding door had been broken. 
     
      
    38 Later investigation demonstrated that the respondent was the perpetrator of another break and enter at Granville which had taken place on 27 July 2001. Cash, jewellery and a mobile phone valued at $2,550 had been taken. Repair to damage caused by the break was estimated to cost $1,000. 
     
      
    39 The respondent had a disrupted childhood. His mother had a son and daughter from another marriage. She married the respondent’s father thereafter. His half siblings reportedly had significant problems, the brother with offending and the sister with self-harming behaviour. His mother was French and the family resided in France for about two years. The marriage failed and the respondent stayed with his mother in the absence of his father from about the age of ten.  
     
      
    40 His mother owned and operated a restaurant in Kings Cross. He spent long hours unsupervised whilst she struggled to run the restaurant. He truanted from school. There were events, including a home invasion when his mother was threatened by having a knife put to her throat. This seemingly may have had some connection with an assertion that she was hiding drugs for his elder brother. The mother died of cancer in 1999.  
     
      
    41 The respondent has some contact with his father who now resides in Queensland. A letter addressed to the presiding judge dated 30 June 2003 confessed that he (the father) was an alcoholic and had been “a very poor parent and therefore feel part of the reason (the respondent) is before the court”.  
     
      
    42 He expressed a hope that his son could be “de-institutionalized”. 
     
      
    43 As at April 2003, the respondent had spent seven and half years of the last ten in custody. That proportion now approaches eight and half years of the last eleven.  
     
      
    44 Undoubtedly his criminal behaviour is significantly associated with a drug habit. A report from Ms Rhonda Danylenko, the alcohol and other drug worker at MRRC Silverwater, dated 23 April 2003 includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “Finally, Mr Toman has received no institutional charges this time in custody and has always presented stable during contact with the writer. Mr Toman is very much aware that he is responsible for his behaviour and that if he is to remain outside, long term, he will need to commit himself at a deeper level.” 
        
       
      
    45 Her report traces the respondent’s descent into illicit drug use. He started with excessive alcohol at age fifteen, used cannabis between the ages of seventeen and twenty three, and at twenty one had started smoking heroin. By aged twenty three he “graduated” to injecting heroin and by twenty five he was injecting cocaine. 
     
      
    46 In 2000 and 2002 he had some methadone and buprenophine treatment. He has never been admitted to a therapeutic centre such as WHOS, the William Booth Programme or Odyssey House. 
     
      
       
      INADEQUACY 
       
      
    47 Whilst, for reasons given, it is not open to the Crown to challenge the quantum of final sentence for the first category of offence and I acknowledge that the argument was put so as to encompass it, I understand the gravamen of complaint to be directed to the very short non-parole period which, leaving to one side the compulsory accumulation of the sentence for escape, effectively set the same non-parole period for the first and second category offences, that is a period expiring on 21 May 2004. Including the imposition for escape the overall effective term can be calculated as imprisonment for four years five months twenty nine days, with a non-parole period of seventeen months twenty nine days.  
     
      
    48 I have already stated that I consider the power of this Court is limited to intervention in respect of the sentences for the second category of offences, that is four years imprisonment to be served concurrently on each of the two counts with a non-parole period of twelve months. In the absence of any other circumstances, I would assess the imposition as manifestly inadequate in terms of the non-parole period set. I do not consider the head sentence of four years imprisonment so to be. 
     
      
    49 This Court has a residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal such as the present and I would exercise that discretion in this case for a combination of reasons.  
     
      
    50 The very great proportion of more than the last decade which this comparatively young offender has spent in custody suggests a real risk that he would re-offend. Should that occur he is at equal risk of being required to serve the head sentence of four years which I do not consider inadequate. If released to parole he would very much be his own keeper and the risk of further lengthy incarceration would, I estimate, be a significant deterrent.51 I infer that this may well be what Barnett DCJ had in mind, that is a proper and adequate head sentence but a lenient, in my view overly lenient, non-parole period but a chance for the respondent to see if he can lead a law abiding life as he seems to have persuaded the alcohol and other drugs worker he appreciates that he needs to do. Despite his rejection of the opportunity received from the Drug Court, it is possible that he may on release appreciate now the wisdom of seeking help from one of the rehabilitation programmes, in none of which to date has he engaged. An affidavit of the respondent received for use if resentence was to be undertaken, does mention that parole authorities, given the nearness of release date currently fixed, have made tentative arrangements for his reception into a twelve month residential program at Cecil O’Neill House run by the Society of St Vincent de Paul. 
     
      
    52 Although the Notice of Crown Appeal followed promptly the impositions of final sentence and sentence for the second category offences, the respondent would have been for a significant period conscious that the initial sentences would, even if confirmed as final sentences, be at a statutory “ceiling”. 
     
      
    53 In addition, in the ordinary course this appeal came on for hearing on 6 February 2004. As already noted, the eligibility date for parole is becoming imminent, that is 21 May next.  
     
      
    54 Although I have concluded that the setting of the non-parole period reflects inadequacy, I have also concluded that this is not a case in which I would intervene to vary the sentences and orders made in the court of first instance. 
     
      
    55 I would in the exercise of this Court’s discretion dismiss the Crown appeal.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Upon the presentation of an indictment before this Court charging him with the murder of his wife Flordelizza O’Connor, the offender Laurence Bede O’Connor pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The plea offered by the offender was not acceptable to the Crown and the trial here in Dubbo proceeded accordingly. The only live issue at the trial was provocation, an issue determined by the jury against the offender. The jury found the offender guilty of murder and the offender is now to be sentenced for the commission of this crime. 
     
      
    2 The crime was committed on a property called Quandalli near Tooraweenah on the 7th July 2007. On that date the offender shot his wife twice, thereby causing her death. Two months after the shooting, the offender admitted to police officers what he had done, and showed them where he had buried his wife’s body in a relatively isolated location on the property. Later in the early hours of the 8th September 2007, following his arrest, the offender participated in a lengthy interview in the police station in Dubbo, in which he admitted to the shooting. Then on the 9th September 2007 he returned with police officers to Quandalli participating in a “walk through” of the crime scene, recorded on video, and he explained how and where he had shot his wife. Indeed a re-enactment was carried out with a police officer assuming the role of the deceased. The offender described how he set about arranging to bury his wife, by placing her in the bucket scoop of a tractor, and then taking her for burial up to the isolated location previously mentioned. The offender described how he buried his wife and placed lime on her body, asserting that the lime was used to deter wild pigs from disturbing the body.  
     
      
    3 The body of the deceased was submitted to post mortem examination which disclosed bullet wounds to the trunk and to the head. The entrance wound to the trunk was in the back at the level of the eighth vertebral column. It nicked the aorta and entered the left lung. The wound track was back to front slightly right to left and upwards. The entrance wound to the head was over the right temple. The skin was perforated and the path of the bullet was through the centre of the brain, settling in soft tissue at the back of the head on the left side. The path was slightly downwards. Though the offender in the demonstration earlier mentioned indicated that he placed the weapon to the left temple of the deceased the post mortem findings were otherwise consistent with the offender’s description of the shooting. 
     
      
    4 I shall presently refer in closer detail to the marital relationship between the offender and his late wife, but addressing firstly the day of the shooting, the offender’s version of the crime not the subject of dispute at the trial, was in summary as follows: 
     
      
       
      That on the morning of the 7th July 2007 the deceased climbed on to the roof of the residence at Quandalli to address a leak problem. The offender stayed near the foot of the ladder. The relationship between the offender and the deceased was not previously a harmonious one and whilst on the roof the deceased told the offender she had taken his car keys, his wallet, his cheque book and his deposit books and that she had burnt his tobacco. The offender searched unsuccessfully for his car keys and said when interviewed by the police that he had had a gutful of the deceased doing these things, which he asserted had been going on for years and getting worse and worse (see questions and answers 95 to 101, and 106 to 119, of the record of interview.) There was a loaded .22 rifle kept on the veranda, placed there for shooting birds that raided the strawberries and this was the gun the offender used. As the deceased was about to descend the ladder, the offender reached for the loaded rifle, released the safety catch, and in the course of her descent placed the weapon against his wife’s spine and fired without warning. The victim fell on to the concrete and was moaning. The offender then placed the rifle against the temple of the deceased and fired the second shot.  
       
       
      This outline of events I find to have been established on the evidence. 
       
      
    5 The offender admitted to the police that when he shot the deceased he intended to kill her (see questions and answers 144-145 and questions and answers 590-591 of the interview of the 8th September 2007). 
     
      
    6 I observed earlier that the central issue at the trial was the issue of provocation and this issue is to be regarded in the context of the respective backgrounds of the offender and of the deceased as established by the evidence which I now summarise. 
     
      
    7 The offender was born on the 6th June 1943 so that he is presently 65 years of age. Until the age of 10 years he lived with his father, his mother and his sisters near Dubbo. Then at the age of 10 years he and the family mentioned moved to Quandalli where the offender finished his primary schooling. He attended high school De La Salle College Dubbo but left school at the age of 15½ years having passed the intermediate certificate examinations. He returned to Quandalli where he remained until the time of the shooting, subject to a period on a prison farm to which I shall refer again later. He learned how to run the property from his father. Merino sheep, cattle, pigs and limited farming took place, and it was the offender’s father who made the business decisions. His mother did not participate in them. The offender’s father died in 1988 and his mother left the property some years later. After his father’s death, it was the offender who cared for the property. The offender expected his wife to follow his mother’s example in leaving business decisions to him once he took over the property. 
     
      
    8 In 1985 three years prior to the death of his father, the offender went to the Philippines where he met Flordelizza, his then future wife. He arranged for her to follow him to Australia and they married in this country. There were two children of the marriage Kathleen born in 1986 and James born in 1987. 
     
      
    9 The marriage was seemingly a happy one at the outset and both parents were devoted to the children of the marriage. However stresses developed between the parents and they increased after the children left home after completing their secondary schooling.  
     
      
    10 The evidence establishes that the offender’s physical integrity was impaired by two accidents. He hurt his back in an accident in 1989 and earlier in 1985 he had injured his right wrist. 
     
      
    11 The evidence established that the offender was an alcoholic. He was also an extremely heavy smoker. In 1977 when affected by liquor he was involved in a motor accident causing the death of a motorcyclist. He was convicted of the crime of culpable driving causing death and was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non parole period of six months. He gave up drinking thereafter for some fifteen years but then started drinking home brew and this he did to excess. The deceased tried to ration the offender’s alcohol intake, allowing him to drink three bottles per day keeping the supplies otherwise under lock and key. The deceased kept the key to the place where the home brew was stored in her possession. 
     
      
    12 By 2000 the condition of the property had deteriorated. The homestead was dilapidated and the offender lost the enthusiasm to work the property, hindered as he was by his physical condition. He decided to lease out most of the property and the deceased resented the leasing. The deceased also resented the offender’s expressed wish to sell the property and to retire into town.  
     
      
    13 The offender resented the deceased’s wish to participate in decisions about the property and he resented the expressed assertion by her that she was “the boss”. Against the wishes of the deceased the offender renewed the lease to one James Terry shortly prior to the shooting. When the deceased learned of this she was extremely upset. In the words of her son James who heard his parents arguing on a visit home just before the shooting, his mother “went ballistic” about the issue of the renewal of the lease.  
     
      
    14 The deceased from the time of her arrival in Australia developed a strong attachment for Quandalli. The evidence discloses that the deceased was a devoted mother to her children and an industrious person who worked hard on the property growing vegetables and raising poddy calves, to all of which she gave pet names. The evidence also establishes she cared for the offender but they quarrelled about their future on Quandalli and the deceased was firm on her views that they should stay there and work the property themselves. The deceased was shrill in her expression of those views when arguments occurred. 
     
      
    15 So much is established by the evidence and this is the background against which the final events in the life of the deceased took place on the 7th July 2007. 
     
      
    16 I add to the above that the offender told the police that the shooting was not something that he had been thinking about for a while (question and answer 145). When asked why he decided to shoot her in the head the offender told the police that “she just got that nasty about any business decisions I made, she tried to overrule me” and that “she use to yell and scream and screech”. He added that “she had a real bad speech and it just got very nerve racking. The sound of her voice would drive you up the wall” (questions and answers 150-153). 
     
      
    17 The accused also told the police that he had not had any alcoholic drink since the night before the shooting. 
     
      
    18 Whilst the jury found against the offender on the issue of provocation, it does not necessarily follow that the issue of mitigation by reason of provocation does not fall for consideration. Indeed it does in the way I shall shortly address. In its written submissions the Crown referred to the dicta of Lee CJ at CL in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485, and I record his Honour’s dicta in Bell which are relevant in the present context: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rejection of these defences does not necessarily mean that the accused cannot get the benefit, as a mitigating factor, at least to some extent of the factual basis upon which they rested. If the sentencing Judge is satisfied from the credible evidence in the case that there was a degree of provocation, he may take it into account as a mitigating factor. But every case must be judged according to its own circumstances and the question for the Court in every case will be whether on the evidence the factor being put forward as a mitigating factor has a relevant connection with the crime in its full sense as I have explained earlier.” 
        
       
      
    19 There were of course two ways in which the jury could have arrived at the decision here that the Crown had negatived provocation: 
     
      
       
      1. that the offender’s conduct in shooting the deceased was not as a result of losing his self-control by reason of any conduct of the deceased towards or effecting the offender; or  
       
       
      2. that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder. 
       
      
    20 Since the verdict of the jury does not inform the Court precisely why it determined that provocation had been negatived, I must examine this issue in the present context, mindful of the remarks in Bell cited above. Any finding that I may make which is adverse to the offender requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. See R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, in particular at 377-378. Any finding favourable to the offender requires satisfaction on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    21 There is much credible evidence which indicates that the behaviour of the offender at the time of the shooting was behaviour that contrasted with his behaviour at earlier times in the marriage when the deceased expressed her displeasure or disapproval towards the offender. Kathleen O’Connor gave evidence about her mother being an excitable person whose voice became elevated when she was arguing or angry. According to Kathleen O’Connor her father rarely joined in discussion when her mother became angry. Rather he simply sat there. Indeed in cross-examination Kathleen O’Connor said that whilst her mother became excited and jumped around in quarrels her father simply sat and listened. 
     
      
    22 James O’Connor gave evidence of hearing an argument between his parents when the lease was due for renewal. He said that his mother shouted at his father but that his father just sat there and took it. 
     
      
    23 A neighbour, Mervyn Braithwaite, who first met the offender in about 1995 described the offender as very approachable and well mannered. He said he heard quite a few arguments between the offender and the deceased. On such occasions he said there was a lot of yelling by the deceased but that the offender was pretty passive. In cross-examination Mr Braithwaite said that he did not witness the offender starting any arguments and he never heard the offender raise his voice towards the deceased.  
     
      
    24 There was no evidence that the offender acted violently towards the deceased or towards anybody else before the occasion of the shooting. I do not overlook the offender’s previous criminal offence but it does not assist me in relation to the issue I am presently considering. 
     
      
    25 A finding by the jury that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder, would have been to my mind a readily understandable finding and as Mr Wilson pointed out the jury returned with its verdict shortly after being given further instruction on this issue. For my part having considered the evidence relevant to this issue I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder. 
     
      
    26 Whilst the verdict of the jury reveals that the offender did not act under provocation within S.23 of the Crimes Act, I find on the balance of probabilities that the offender shot the deceased after the conduct by the deceased on the morning of the shooting impacted upon his self control and that he was subject to some loss of self control at the time of the shooting. In his evidence in this Court the offender accepted that the action of the deceased in hiding the bank books, keys and the tobacco were only childish acts. He said that he shot his wife out of frustration and annoyance and rage. He also acknowledged that he shot his wife for very flimsy reasons. Nevertheless following close reflection on the evidence in point I have made the finding expressed above and it follows that the offender is entitled to have taken into account as a mitigating factor the circumstance that there was some loss of self control at the time of the shooting after the deceased had conducted herself in the manner described in the evidence. 
     
      
    27 I turn to consider subjective features of this case.  
     
      
    28 I have already dealt with aspects of this in a review of the background of the offender set out in paragraph 7 and following above. 
     
      
    29 In the hearing as to sentence Mr Wilson introduced reports from Dr Allnutt and Dr Pulman. 
     
      
    30 Dr Allnutt made an assessment of the offender on the 15th February 2008 (see Exhibit 2 as to sentence). His opinion was that the offender manifested no psychiatric disorder which would have rendered him unfit to stand trial but Dr Allnutt invited a neuropsychological assessment directed to the possibility of a defence to the crime charged of substantial impairment. Hence it was that a neuropsychological assessment was made by Dr Pulman in May 2008 (see exhibit 3 as to sentence). According to Dr Pulman there was no evidence of any deficits in neuropsychological functioning that could be considered as substantial impairment under section 23A of the Crimes Act. The only other medical evidence introduced on the hearing as to sentence was a report from Dr Stephen Hampton. His report (exhibit 1 on sentence) was based on a review of records concerning the offender since he has been in custody. The report refers to no serious medical problems suffered by the offender. The opinion is expressed in this report that Justice Health will be able to provide services required for any treatment of the offender which may become necessary concerning his respiratory tract problems and other matters addressed in the report.  
     
      
    31 In his own evidence the offender told the Court that his health was better now than at the time of his arrest. The offender says that he entertains no suicidal thoughts now. He was treated for his skin cancer whilst in custody and he is presently on no medication. There does not appear to be any existing medical condition at present rendering the circumstances of his incarceration more burdensome than would otherwise be expected. 
     
      
    32 Whilst the shooting was deliberate and carried out with the intention to kill I do accept as Mr Wilson submitted, that the commission of the crime was not premeditated and that the rifle was within reach because it had been placed where it was to deter birds. The fatal decision which the offender took was taken whilst the deceased was on the roof, and shortly before her descent down the ladder. 
     
      
    33 I accept the submission made by Mr Wilson that I should find that the offender is remorseful and contrite in respect of his crime. In making this finding I do not overlook the fact that after the shooting he acted swiftly to conceal the body of the deceased and that he lied on many occasions, to his children, to his sister and to police officers about the whereabouts of his wife. I accept the submission made that in so acting the offender was significantly motivated by a perception that he needed time to put his affairs in order by selling animals, grain and machinery. In the period between the date of the shooting and his confession of his crime to police the offender drank to excess and he did so continually. But in any event whether in covering up his crime for some two months the offender was only motivated by wanting to put his affairs in order, nevertheless I find that by the time he confessed to his crime, the offender was indeed contrite and remorseful. Following the shooting, the offender contemplated suicide, as evidenced by his note and his map (see exhibits L and N). When interviewed on the 8th September 2007 (answer to question 457) the offender said “remorse. Pretty terrible thing. I’ve owned up.” He referred to the fact that he had two children and that they would never be able to look him in the face (see questions and answers 457 and 458). In his evidence at the trial the offender acknowledged that what happened on the morning of the shooting before he fired the shot could have been resolved, and he agreed that he had shot his wife for what seemed flimsy reasons. 
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are good. Indeed I consider it highly unlikely that this offender will re-offend at any time in the future. 
     
      
    35 I find that the offender offered considerable assistance to the police after he told a police officer on the 7th September 2007 that he wanted “to come clean”. Thereafter he confessed to his crime and showed the police where he had buried his wife’s body. 
     
      
    36 The manner in which this trial was conducted is to be considered. In focusing on the issue of provocation a shortening of the time taken up at the trial was achieved. The utilitarian consequence of this is a matter to be brought into account in the offender’s favour. 
     
      
    37 In approaching my sentencing task I must heed the provisions of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    38 The present case is not one calling for a sentence of life imprisonment nor does the Crown submit that such a sentence is called for. Accordingly section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act needs to be considered. Under this section a standard non-parole period of twenty years has been set. Section 54D is of course to be read in conjunction with section 54A and section 54B. Section 54A(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ”For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division.” 
        
       
       
      Section 54B provides: 
       
        
         
        (1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence. 
        
       
      
    39 The effect of Part 4 Division 1A and how it bears upon the task of sentencing was considered in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and in R v AJP [2004] 150 A Crim R 575 and again in MLP v R [2006] 164 A Crim R 93. 
     
      
    40 I refer to the judgment of Kirby J in MLP v R with which Grove J and Hislop J agreed. His Honour referred in MLP to what Simpson J had said earlier in AJP. His Honour described her Honour’s remarks in the earlier case as being “a helpful distillation of the principles in Way”. With that description I respectfully agree. What her Honour said in AJP was this: 
     
      
       
        
        [32] The following propositions emerge from  
        Way  
        and subsequent cases:  
         
         
        (i) while s 54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; … 
         
         
        (ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (para [68]); 
         
         
        (iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74]–[77]); 
         
         
        (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the mens rea of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85]–[86]); 
         
         
        (v) that an offence is “typical” or “common” does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (para [101]); 
         
         
        (vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence: (paras [101]–[102]); 
         
         
        (vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (para [122]); see also

    41 Having cited the above dicta Kirby J proceeded in MLP at [33] to [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        [33] The non parole period is, of course, but one aspect of the sentence. In respect of an offence where there is a standard non parole period, the sentencing Judge must at some point address the following issues when imposing a custodial sentence: 
         
        
       
      
    · First, what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender? Guidance may be provided by the maximum penalty, statistics from the Judicial Commission and the collective wisdom emerging from a range of sentences involving similar conduct (cf R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43, per Barr J; R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247). 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Secondly, should the offence be characterised as being in the mid range of objective seriousness? That task should be approached in the manner suggested by Simpson J (above), intuitively evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence and looking to those matters in s 21A, aggravating or mitigating, that relate to the offence (including the offender's state of mind). Matters in s 21A which form part of what is usually termed ""the subjective case"" of the offender are not relevant to the issue of whether the offence falls within the mid range. If the offence falls within the mid range, the standard non parole period should apply, subject to the remaining issues. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Thirdly, are there other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non parole period? The subjective case of the offender (issues such as youth or prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)) may furnish reasons for departing from the standard non parole period. It should be noted that s 21A(1) provides that the matters specifically identified in the subparagraphs of s 21A are in addition to any other matter that the Court is required or permitted to take into account under any Act or rule of law. The fact that the offender may need to serve his sentence in protection, for instance, although not mentioned in s 21A(3), may be taken into account in determining whether there should be a departure from the standard non parole period. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Fourthly, there is the issue of special circumstances. Ordinarily, the non parole period bears a relationship to the term of the sentence defined by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that is, the non parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term, unless there are special circumstances. The sentencing Judge is therefore required to address that issue. If there is to be an adjustment, then it must not so deplete the non parole period that it is reduced below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (Power v R (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; Bugmy v R (1990) 169 CLR 525). 
     
      
       
        
        [34] There is no requirement that these issues be addressed in any particular order ( 
        R v Moffitt 
          
        (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 
        ), although the issues are obviously inter-related such that a decision on one aspect may have implications for another. In addressing these issues, the sentencing Judge should, however, bear in the mind the following advice provided in  
        R v Way: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          124 The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in  
          R v McGourty 
            
          [2002] NSWCCA 335 
           at [45]) cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect. 
          
         
        
       
      
    42 I heed what was said by Simpson J in AJP and by Kirby J in MLP in considering the sentence to be imposed on this offender. 
     
      
    43 The Crown has submitted, in my view correctly, that there are aggravating features of this case under section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) that the commission of the crime involved the use of a weapon (section 21A(2)(c))  
         
         
        (ii) that there were two discrete acts of shooting (section 21A(2)(m)) 
        
       
      
    44 Mr Wilson has submitted that there are mitigating features for the purposes of section 21A(3): 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the offence was not part of a planned activity (section 21A(3)(b)). 
         
         
        (ii) the offender was provoked by the deceased (section 21A(3)(c)). 
         
         
        (iii) the offender has no record relevant for present purposes (section 21A(3)(e)). 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the offender is to be considered of good character (section 21A(3)(m)). 
         
         
        (v) the offender is unlikely to re-offend (section 21A(3)(g)). 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation (section 21A(3)(h)). 
         
         
        (vii) the offender has shown remorse (section 21A(3)(i)). 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) the offender provided assistance to law enforcement authorities (section 21A(3)(m)). 
        
       
      
    45 I consider that the evidence establishes the existence of each of the mitigating features advanced by Mr Wilson. As to provocation, I have previously expressed my finding as to there being some measure of loss of self-control (see para 26 above). I earlier identified assistance I find the offender offered to the police and he also identified to them the fire arm that he had used.  
     
      
    46 I have concluded that the present offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder, albeit not by much. In reaching this conclusion I am mindful of the lack of premeditation and the absence of planning, and the fact that the offender was subjected to some loss of self-control.  
     
      
    47 There are also of course the mitigating features found for the purpose of section 21A(3) to be considered in order to arrive at an appropriate non-parole period and in order to structure a suitable sentence. 
     
      
    48 In the course of his submissions, Mr Wilson referred to the sentences imposed in many cases for the crime of murder. I have considered each of the decisions to which I have been referred in the written submissions, but I do not consider it would be useful to review all those decisions here. One of those cases was R v Toki [2003] NSWCCA 125. In Toki Hidden J reviewed sentences imposed in cases of murder in the setting of an intimate relationship. Having conducted an extensive review and identifying certain exceptional cases his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “otherwise sentences ranged from 14 to 24 years, the majority of them being less than 20 years” (para 29). 
        
       
      
    49 The decision in Toki preceded the introduction of Part 4 Division 1A and in R v Youmaran [2008] NSWSC 762 Rothman J remarked (at para 4) “the introduction of a standard non-parole period for the crime of murder had a significant effect in increasing the range of sentences generally imposed for the crime of murder.”. His Honour’s observations accord with my review of the cases. The observation also seems to be consistent with the schedule of sentences which Mr Wilson handed up in the course of submissions. 
     
      
    50 Ultimately of course my task is to determine what sentence is appropriate in the present case by reference to the particular features of it, both objective and subjective. 
     
      
    51 A Victim Impact Statement was read in Court by Kathleen O’Connor and this statement refers to the tragic consequences of what happened, particularly concerning herself and her brother. It is appropriate that the impact of the crime committed by the offender be acknowledged. However I must heed the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the decisions in Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76; Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510; Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 and King [2004] NSWCCA 444. It is not appropriate, following the authorities mentioned, that I be influenced by the content of the Victim Impact Statement in determining an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    52 Mr Wilson submitted that there are special circumstances for the purposes of section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Wilson refers to the offender’s age and to the circumstance that the length of the sentence to be imposed may mean that the offender could spend the rest of his life in custody. He submitted further that as he ages the hardship associated with the offender’s incarceration will increase. Reference was made to R v Holyoak [1995] 82 A Crim R 502. In that case Allen J remarked that advanced age is not a reason for not imposing a proper penalty even if the penalty imposed would mean that the offender may spend the whole of his remaining years in custody. However Allen J proceeded to say:  
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody. It does not make proportionality irrelevant. Likewise, the effect of the sentence upon general deterrence is not irrelevant. What, however, is appropriate by way of full-time custody, viewed from the point of view of general deterrence, must be considered in the light of the impact upon public perception of a gaol sentence imposed upon a man of such advanced years upon whom the sentence would bear the more heavily because of his very age and the real risk that he will never walk free. These considerations weigh heavily upon me.  
        
       
      
    53 The observations made by Allen J in the above cited passage are not to be ignored. I am mindful of the fact that the offender is at present sixty-five years of age and I do not overlook this in deciding upon an appropriate sentence. However I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances which would warrant reduction of the non-parole period which I here consider to be appropriate, by reason of the offender’s age. I have expressed findings in relation to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and consider no longer period than that which I am about to set by way of the balance of the term is required in this case. Moreover I consider the non parole period for the sentence should be no less than I am about to set, having regard to the objective gravity of the crime committed by the offender. 
     
      
    54 Whilst I have determined that the present offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the purposes of Division 4 Part 1A it by no means follows that this crime committed by the offender is to be regarded as anything other than a serious offence as indeed are all offences of murder. The offender shot his unsuspecting victim twice at close range with intent to kill. The crime he committed was a callous and a cowardly one. The crime is to be denounced and considerations of deterrence and punishment of the offender must be adequately addressed. 
     
      
    55 The offender has been in custody since the 7th September 2007. The sentence is to be backdated accordingly. 
     
      
    56 I now proceed to pass sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Laurence Bede O’Connor, for the murder of Flordelizza O’Connor I sentence you to a non-parole period of 16 years commencing on the 7th September 2007 and expiring on the 6th September 2023 and to a balance of term of 5 years commencing on the 7th September 2023 and expiring on the 6th September 2028. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 6th September 2023.

      MONDAY 28 MAY 2001 
      
      REGINA v. KING YOON TAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   DOWD, J: The court is in a position to give judgment on the appeal and I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
     2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant by Bellear, DCJ. in the District Court of New South Wales on 14 December 1999. 
     3   The applicant had pleaded guilty before a Magistrate under s.51A of the Justices Act 1902 to a charge of an offence of importing into Australia prohibited imports to which s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) commonly known as ecstasy, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. 
     4   When the applicant came forward for sentence he was forty one years old, having been born on 11 May 1958. He came from Malaysia. He was a plumber by occupation. 
     5   The amount he imported was the sum of some 1.846 grams gross, the pure weight of the drug being some 736 grams. The commercial quantity is .5 kilograms, consequently the applicant had imported some 200 grams above the commercial quantity. The maximum penalty fixed by the Customs Act 1901, s.235, for this offence in this circumstance is life imprisonment. 
     6   The short facts were that the prisoner was apprehended at the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport having flown from Kuala Lumpur. His luggage was searched and a body search was conducted which showed that a number of packages were secured about his body and inside his thighs with tape. The packages contained tablets of the forbidden drug. Also located in his possession was some $2,000 in Australian currency.  
     7   In due course he was spoken to and the learned trial judge summarised the effect of what he said in that interview in his remarks on sentence.  
     8   He said that he was told the packages contained something described as ""shake head drug"". He was told that after you take the drug you become ""dancy"". He collected the packages from somewhere in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. He had been contacted by a person he didn't know on a public telephone. He is not sure who told him to go to the phone box. An envelope containing the wherewithal for him to arrange through a travel agent his flight to Australia had been left for him at a cafe he frequented. He converted the balance of monies into Australian currency, after paying for his airfare and booking his accommodation. He was asked to come to Australia by someone he did not know. Someone he did not know was going to collect the packages from him and he was simply to wait in the De Vere Hotel for someone to contact him and collect the packages. 
     9   The learned trial judge was of the view, as is apparent from his findings, that the applicant was a bare or mere courier. He was given the benefit of a finding that he had entered the plea of guilty at an early stage and that the early plea was a reflection of his contrition. Further, that the plea had associated with it a substantial utilitarian component so that he had, in the findings of the trial judge, the benefit both of contrition and the saving of time and money to the community. 
     10   The trial judge, when assessing the level of culpability, considered that the applicant may have been recruited to bring the drugs into Australia for reward on one occasion only. Thus he was recorded as finding the applicant's role met the description of bare or minimum courier. His Honour treated such a person as being at the lower end of the spectrum of culpability. 
     11   His Honour also, having regard to matters referred to in the interview, held that the prisoner's motive for his role was to gain money for medical attention to be furnished to his mother for whom he apparently cared deeply and that the applicant's personal circumstances had apparently, until this time, been attended by prior good character, which his Honour took into account. He further took into account that the prisoner will suffer additional hardship by reason of being confined for a substantial period of time far away from his family, his culture and the prospects of contact with his loved ones and friends. 
     12   His Honour referred to the prisoner's family circumstances, his childhood and economic hardship, his recent divorce and the fact that he had custody of the two children of his marriage aged 16 and 14, who are being cared for by his elderly and ill mother.  
     13   Apparently, although he had attained trade qualifications in Singapore and had worked in France as a construction worker and kitchen hand he was unable there or in Singapore to earn the money necessary in his view to enable his mother to have the treatment to which he referred. 
     14   Thus it was that he came to commit the offence and thus it was that his Honour found that the prisoner presented to the Probation and Parole Service and to the trial judge as a man who was very committed to his family and was anxious to return to Malaysia to be reunited with them. 
     15   Notwithstanding all of those matters which his Honour took into account to the prisoner's advantage, his Honour properly had regard to the necessary general and personal deterrent factors and, in particular, to the clear sentencing pattern and the decisions of this court that sentences must be such that those who are involved in the drug trade bringing the commodity into this country for financial gain must be made aware that this country will meet such activities by a consistently tough sentencing policy. 
     16   His Honour concluded that no sentence other than a full time custodial sentence was appropriate in all the circumstances and that it was necessary to pass in this individual case a sentence of both general and person deterrent. 
     17   He had regard, of necessity, to reducing the sentence otherwise appropriate for the absence of remissions in this State, in accordance with the application of s.16G of the Crimes Act 1900 and concluded that an appropriate sentence of seven years commencing from the date on which the applicant went into custody, with a non-parole period of four years and six months, should be imposed. 
     18   The applicant has filed a letter of written submission dated 3 May 2001. That letter raised three matters, the first being that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account the prospect of the applicant being involved in a controlled delivery so as to enable the apprehension of those in Australia who might come to the hotel to collect the drugs. 
     19   Today he informed us he did not wish to maintain that ground, it having been inserted by mistake in the document by a friend upon whose advice he had relied, he having needed the assistance of someone proficient in English and aware of the system. No such matter or any indication of any such matter had been raised before the trial judge nor was there any evidence before the trial judge that would enable the applicant to take any active role in seeking to have those minded to obtain the drugs from him come to the hotel. On his account he did not know who might call and thus would be unable to make phone calls to have those persons come to the hotel. 
     20   Secondly, he raised a ground asserting that the trial judge had failed to give considerable weight to the early plea of guilty, previous good character and the hardship he will have to endure in a foreign land, particularly in the context of his mother's deteriorating health.  
     21   It is sufficient to say that I have already referred to the trial judge taking those very matters into account and giving them substantial weight.  
     22   He also submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Even taking into account the various matters personal to him and in his favour, that submission is simply not made out. 
     23   Although he referred to the sentence in the matter of Regina v. Hauser (CCA, unreported 11 December 1997) in which the appellant's original sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years was reduced by this court to a sentence of four and a half years and a non-parole period of two and a half years, the circumstances in that case were entirely different. That was a case which involved an internal courier whose other offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1992 involved small amounts of money utterly unrelated to any drug activity but whose sentence otherwise regarded by the court as appropriate, indeed, lenient, was reduced according to the parity principle because of an even more lenient sentence imposed on a co-accused. Neither that decision nor those to which the Crown has taken us in their written submissions nor those shown in the sentencing statistics assists the applicant's case. 
     24   It is only if this court is persuaded that the trial judge has fallen into error in the exercise of his sentencing discretion and that some lesser sentence warranted in law should have been passed that the court is entitled in law to interfere with the trial judge's sentence. 
     25   No such ground has been made out here. 
     26   I therefore conclude that although the matter having been fully argued, leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     27   I would propose orders accordingly.  
     28   DOWD, J: I agree with the proposed orders and the reasons for those orders of Greg James, J. 
     29   SMART, AJ: I also agree. 
     30   DOWD, J: The orders, therefore, will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

13130,2774641,Evitts v R [2015] NSWDC 415,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate, His Honour Judge Henson, sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 30 September 2015.
	
	
	The appellant was charged with two offences. The first charge was that late in the evening of 17 March 2015 or early in the morning of 18 March 2015 the appellant assaulted Constable Samantha Almond, a police officer, when she was executing her duty, by kicking her in the crotch with her high healed shoe. The second offence was that in the same period of time the appellant failed to leave licenced premises, namely, Jacksons on George, situated at 175 George Street, Sydney when required to do so by an authorised person, she being a person to whom an authorised person was entitled to refuse admission to the licensed premises under s 77 of the Liquor Act 2007. The offence is constituted by s 77(4) of that Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his or her duty is imprisonment for two years and or a fine of $5,500 if the matter be prosecuted in the Local Court. If the matter were prosecuted in this Court the appellant would have been liable for imprisonment for up to five years. The maximum penalty for the offence under the Liquor Act 2007 is a fine of $5,500.
	
	
	17 March in any year is St Patrick’s Day. In 2015 St Patrick’s Day fell on a Tuesday. At about 11.30pm on St Patrick’s Day 2015 the appellant was in Jackson’s on George. She approached the bar in order to purchase a drink but was observed by bar staff to be moderately intoxicated, slurring her speech, displaying pale, flushed skin and bloodshot watery eyes. She was refused service by the bar staff. The appellant then argued with the bar staff that she was not intoxicated. She was then approached by security guards who advised her that because of her level of intoxication she was required to leave the premises. The appellant then started arguing with the security guards and according to the agreed facts was “quarrelsome”. She repeatedly called the bar staff “twats”. She was to use that terminology throughout the evening. That terminology is slang for female genitalia. It now also has come to mean the buttocks. During her argument with the security staff the security staff showed her an information card advising her of the fact that it was a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up $550 to refuse to leave premises when intoxicated. According to the agreed facts the appellant read the card out aloud to the security staff making a joke of the situation. Because she failed to leave the premises as was required by the security staff, the police were called.
	
	
	The police arrived at 10 minutes to midnight. They were identified in the Facts Sheet as being five in number but the only relevant member of the New South Wales Police was Constable Almond whom I have already mentioned. The police identified themselves to the appellant and told her that by failing to leave the premises upon being directed to do so by the security staff she had committed an offence. The appellant then commenced arguing with the police. She protested that she was not intoxicated. Nevertheless, the police could smell intoxicating liquor on her breath, and observed her to display pale, flushed skin. She was slurring her speech, she was unsteady on her feet and her eyes were bloodshot. Still protesting that she was not intoxicated the appellant was escorted out of the premises by the police. Outside the premises there was a further argument between the appellant and the police. She requested them to administer a breath test to her, calling the police “twats”. She protested that she had done nothing wrong. She also protested that she had never been told to leave by the security staff which was obviously untrue. When asked to provide identification she protested that she had none on her. Because of her argumentative and quarrelsome behaviour she was arrested for a breach of s 77 of the Liquor Act 2007. She was then escorted to the rear of a police caged vehicle and directed to sit down on the floor of the cage. She was then told to keep her feet still whilst the police took her pink high heels from her feet.
	
	
	The agreed facts continue thus:
	


“Swearing at police the accused has again stated: ‘You fucking twats, I haven’t done anything wrong’. Immediately pushing herself towards the back, the rear back wall of the caged section of the vehicle, the accused has quickly brought back both her legs, tucking her knees in towards her chest.

Police were trying to remove the accused’s shoes and the accused pushed her legs forwards extending them out straight in the direction of the police. Coming into contact with Constable Almond, the accused has dug the heels of her pink high heels into the crotch region of Constable Almond. Constable Almond has felt immediate pain to her crotch region.

Police have immediately grabbed the accused’s legs. Holding her legs, police then removed the accused’s pink high heels from her feet. The appellant was then advised that she was now also under arrest for assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty. The appellant was then conveyed to the Day Street Police Station but whilst in custody continued to be quarrelsome, argumentative and belligerent and continued to swear at the police.”

In her evidence today the appellant said that she only swore once at the police but that is inconsistent with the agreed facts on which the appellant stood for sentence, before the learned Chief Magistrate.


	
	According to the agreed facts when the appellant had the charges explained to her, she said to Constable Almond “you deserved to be kicked”. The appellant denied saying that in her oral evidence today but clearly that was an agreed fact on which she stood for sentence before the learned Chief Magistrate.
	
	
	At the time of these offences the appellant was 26 years old. She remains that age. She came before the Local Court as a lady of prior good character. She has no criminal record in Australia and has given evidence, which I am prepared to accept, that she had no prior record in the United Kingdom. The appellant was born and grew up in and was educated in the United Kingdom. She graduated from Loughborough University where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Sports and Exercise Science. She then joined Deloitte in the United Kingdom and became a qualified accountant. She became a chartered accountant in 2004, gaining that qualification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. She came to Australia in late 2014 and is working in Australia for Deloitte on a 457 visa. She works for Deloitte as a senior analyst here in Sydney.
	
	
	The original court attendance notices were first returnable on 22 April 2015. They were next mentioned on 3 June 2015. On 10 June 2015 they were again mentioned before Magistrate O’Brien who confirmed that pleas of not guilty had been entered. I can only assume that the first pleas of not guilty were entered either on 22 April or 3 June. On 10 June the Deputy Chief Magistrate, Magistrate O’Brien, set the matter down for hearing on 16 September 2015. When the matter came on for hearing on that day the appellant entered pleas of guilty before Magistrate Keogh and the matter was then adjourned until 30 September 2015 when the appellant stood for sentence before his Honour Judge Henson the Chief Magistrate. His Honour fined the appellant $1,000 for the offence of assaulting a police office in the execution of the officer’s duty and fined the appellant $500 for the offence contrary to s 77(4) of the Liquor Act 2007.
	
	
	In essence, the appellant asks me to deal with her under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She wishes me to set the convictions aside and to place her on a bond to be of good behaviour under s 10. In the alternative to my dealing with her on that basis, in respect of both the offences, the appellant asks that I deal with her for assaulting the police officer under s 10 but the fine entered for the offence against the Liquor Act 2007 stand.
	
	
	Clearly, this young lady was a woman of prior good character. She has contributed much to our community, perhaps I should say ‘to our communities’. There is evidence before me of her doing work for the disadvantaged in the United Kingdom when she was a student and of assisting those less fortunate than her. She represented the United Kingdom in karate. She was obviously also a keen sportswoman and still is an active sportswoman. In a reference from her sister the following is stated:
	


“Prior to Emily’s corporate career she has worked with a local sporting initiative within the community on an employed and volunteer basis, and has worked in a boarding school environment where she has demonstrated her compassionate and caring nature, as well as leadership, moral guidance and overall decency of character.”

There are a large number of references before me, as there were before the learned Chief Magistrate, attesting to this event being out of character. I accept that it is unlikely that the appellant will offend again in any similar manner, chastened as she has been by the legal process to date and the odium that she has experienced as a result of her being prosecuted for these offences. She clearly has been ashamed and embarrassed.


	
	Under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the things which I can take into consideration are: the appellant’s character, her antecedents, her age, her health and her mental condition, the trivial nature of the offence, any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, or any other matter that a Court thinks proper to consider.
	
	
	The offence of assaulting a police officer, is not trivial. I cannot see any extenuating circumstance. This was, as has been submitted by the Crown, alcohol-fuelled violence. There is no matter other than those specifically stated in s 10(3) that has been drawn to my attention. In essence, the appellant relies on her prior good character, her relative youth, and she also relies on a “medical condition”. She also relies upon the fact that the convictions recorded may interfere with her professional career path. As a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales she is required to notify that Institute of any conviction. Such is common in many professions, not only accountancy, but also in law and medicine. However, I believe it unlikely that the sort of offence which the offender has been convicted will lead to any change of status as a chartered accountant. One would think that any conviction for any crime involving dishonesty would interfere with such a qualification but it is difficult to see how this crime could affect a person’s ability to work as an accountant.
	
	
	The appellant relied upon a report of Tracey Cahn, a clinical psychologist, dated 28 September 2015 following upon an interview on 21 September 2015. Ms Cahn diagnosed “adjustment disorder mixed anxiety and depressed mood”. Quite frankly anybody who is about to appear for sentence would be expected to be suffering from anxiety and depression. According to Ms Cahn’s report a number of events were identified as contributing factors to the emotional distress precipitating “the incident” which I assume is meant the two criminal offences committed by the appellant. The list of events is this:
	



	
	“Moderate drinking at the time of the incident.
	
	
	Lack of knowledge of Australian Liquor Laws relating to removal from premises/failure to leave.
	
	
	Perception of provocative actions by the security guard, which triggered a reactive response by Ms Evitts.
	
	
	A strong belief that she was not intoxicated and her behaviour at the time of the incident was not unruly.
	
	
	Poor strategies for the management of alcohol.”
	


The first is the moderate drinking at the time of the incident. Ms Cahn had a history that the appellant went out with a group of work colleagues for work drinks at approximately 9pm. According to Ms Cahn’s history the appellant consumed four small glasses of wine at an establishment called “The Hart” and then proceeded to Jacksons on George at approximately 10pm. As I have earlier stated she was refused service at 11.30pm at Jacksons on George. According to the appellant’s oral evidence before me she had nothing to drink at Jacksons on George and when she approached the bar to obtain her first drink there she was denied service. However, what the appellant actually consumed on this evening is a matter of conjecture. The appellant told me not that she went drinking at 9pm but that she went drinking at 6.30pm. She did not have “four small glasses of wine” but four large glasses of wine. Whether the glasses of wine were large or small one would not expect if only four had been consumed between 6.30 and 11.30pm one would not expect the level of intoxication noted by bar staff, security staff and the police. Inherently, what the appellant says about the extent of her intoxication and the extent of her alcohol consumption is extremely unreliable.


	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was a lack of knowledge of “Australian Liquor Laws”. There is no Australian Liquor Law. There are laws in each State and Territory of the Commonwealth which are different. However, most of our law is still based on English law and the extent of the differences between the law in the States and the United Kingdom is not great. Furthermore, ignorance of the law is no excuse.
	
	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was “perception of provocative actions by the security guard”. That is only her perception and the perception of people when intoxicated is often erroneous. Nothing can be attributed to such a perception other than intoxication.
	
	
	The next point raised by the psychologist was a “strong belief” that the appellant was not intoxicated. She protested her sobriety to both the bar staff, the security staff and the police but none of them accepted that, nor does the appellant now accept that, because she has pleaded guilty to the offence under the Liquor Act 2007. Her “strong belief” was in fact a misunderstanding of the situation based on her intoxication.
	
	
	That the appellant had “poor strategies for the management of alcohol” consumption is axiomatic. There is nothing in the report other than an attempt to medicalise what is in fact criminal behaviour.
	
	
	The provisions in s 10 about taking into account the offender’s health and mental condition is not here apposite. If it were so, it would mean that anyone who committed an offence whilst intoxicated ought be given the benefit of s 10.
	
	
	There are two things which point in the opposite direction to the path that the appellant asks me to take. The first point is that police do a very important job in our community. Without the police there would be disorder. The police keep the peace. They do dangerous work often and often, for it, are abused. They expose themselves to danger and here Constable Almond was assaulted and suffered pain in her groin. Police often do work for which they are abused but which ultimately is in the interests of everybody concerned. They run risks, they are entitled to protection of not only the Courts and the law but also the general community. As I said earlier, assaulting a police office is not a trivial offence. The appellant’s general behaviour was self-indulgent and belligerent. Not only did she assault Constable Almond but she told Constable Almond that she deserved to be kicked. Clearly, the appellant intended to kick the constable despite what she said in the witness box today.
	
	
	The other thing which stands against the course which the appellant asksme to take is that she appeared for sentence before another Judge of this Court who also holds the position as Chief Magistrate of this State. His Honour is a very experienced Judge who hears many more cases of this nature than I do. For example, if one goes to look at statistics one finds that since July 2011, 959 persons have been sentenced in the Local Court for assaulting police but only three people have been sentenced in the District Court for assaulting police. In other words, the vast majority of these cases are dealt with by magistrates who have greater exposure to the prevalence of this offence than judges of this Court do. The sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate are entitled to be given weight because of the extent of his experience and his oversight of the other magistrates who also deal with the same sort of offence.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate case in which I should interfere with the sentences passed in the Local Court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

The plaintiffs are a firm of hauliers. The defendants are in the business of importing and distributing bank vault doors. In April 1990, one of the defendants' customers, DBS Bank, was moving to new premises. The bank wanted the doors at their old premises to be dismantled for use later at their new premises. As the new premises were not ready, the doors had to be kept in storage somewhere. The defendants, through their marketing manager Mr Jason Tan, got in touch with Mr Koh, the general manager of the plaintiffs. Their discussions led to a written quotation from the plaintiffs dated 21 April 1990. This document is of some importance, and I set it out verbatim:
We are pleased to submit our quotation for your perusal as flw :-
Supplying Labours, Lorries, Mobile Crane and working tools to transport 7 Nos. of vaults doors from DBS Shenton Way basement to Bukit Batok DBS and our Warehouse.
We are quoting as flwg:-
A) One No. vault door (wt 500-600 kgs) & One "" (wt 800 kgs) to be transport from DBS Shenton Way Basement to DBS Bukit Batok.
B) Five nos. vault doors (wt 500-600 kgs) to be transported from DBS Shenton Way Basement to Our Warehouse for storage.
SUM QUOTED PER NO. S$500.00 ---$2500.00
These five nos. doors are to be stuffed into pallets for storage in our Warehouse.
SUM QUOTED PER PALLET AT S$350.00 ----$1750.00
Insurance Coverage for each of machinery is insured at the maximum amount (of not exceeding) S$150,000.00 ONLY.
As stated in this quotation, two of the doors were to go to the bank's premises at Bukit Batok and five of them were to go to ""our warehouse"" for storage. Further discussions followed. The two doors which were originally going to DBS Bukit Batok were to go into storage as well as the five doors. The discussions led to the issue by the defendants of a purchase order dated 16 May 1990. The material part of that is set out below:
A) 5 Nos vault doors (600 kg)
To be transported from DBS Shenton Way basement to your warehouse for storage .............. $2,000
B) 1 No vault door (wt 1.5 Ton) 1 No vault door (wt 800 kg)
To be transported from DBS warehouse in Jurong to your warehouse for storage ............ $ 600/-
C) 7 Nos of vault doors are to be shifted into pallet and wrapped with plastic for storage in your warehouse ........$2,100/- $4,700/-
REMARKS
You are responsible for the safekeeping of the doors and any damages caused arising from dismantling, transporting, handling and storage.
N.B. : Please quote our P.O. No. in your delivery note and invoice.
The words under the ""Remarks"" heading are a bone of contention in these proceedings.
On 17 May 1990, the doors were dismantled by the defendants, loaded on to the plaintiffs' lorries and taken to a warehouse belonging to Everise Warehousing & Transportation Pte Ltd. They were taken into storage.
An invoice dated 17 May 1990 was issued by the plaintiffs. It referred to the defendants' purchase order number, and to the transport of the doors to ""our warehouse"" for storage and to storage in ""our warehouse.""
The warehouse shared premises with other warehouses in a common building. As luck would have it, a few days later, at about 10 o'clock on the evening of 25 May, a fire broke out in one of the neighbouring warehouses. It engulfed the entire building. The doors stored in the Everise warehouse were all damaged beyond repair.
In this action, the plaintiffs claim the sum of $7,500, being the total sum of four invoices. This includes an invoice for $4,700 for the work in relation to the seven doors. The defendants deny liability for this invoice, and in turn make a counterclaim for the loss of the doors damaged in the fire. The parties have agreed the sum of $50,000 as the value of the doors. The action had been started in November 1991 in the subordinate courts, but was subsequently transferred to this court as the amount of the counterclaim at the time ($87,000) exceeded the then jurisdiction of the subordinate courts.
The central issue of the case concerns the scope of the contract and the scope of the plaintiffs' obligations under it. The plaintiffs contend that they were responsible only for the safe transport of the doors to the warehouse. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the plaintiffs were not only responsible for transporting the doors to the warehouse, but also responsible for their safe storage and that any damage to or loss of the doors is chargeable to the plaintiffs.
Mr Koh's evidence is that his firm's business was that of hauliers. It did not have a warehouse; neither did it store or undertake to store goods for customers. He knew of Everise's warehouse, having stored his own equipment there. When the defendants asked him to arrange for storage, he agreed to arrange to transport them to the Everise warehouse. He said that he told Jason Tan that the charges would probably be about $8 a cubic metre, and that the warehouse owners would bill the defendants direct. He could not have agreed to be responsible for storage because, in the first place, he did not have a warehouse of his own, and, secondly, storage was not part of his business. He pointed out that he never charged the defendants for the storage, and that it was Everise who in fact undertook the storage. He referred to a warehouseman's receipt issued by Everise to the defendants dated 18 May 1990. It so happened that, as confirmed by the receipt chop of the defendants, this document, together with a bill for a door previously put into storage, was received by the defendants at 12 noon on 25 May, the day of the fire but before the fire. So the authencity of these documents cannot be in doubt. The plaintiffs say that these documents support their contention that the storage contract was always intended to be between Everise and the defendants and not between the plaintiffs and defendants.
Mr Koh is illiterate in the English language. He appears to have relied on a clerk, Miss Lim, to deal with correspondence and documents in English. Mr Koh's evidence is that the purchase order had not been brought to his attention at that time. He said that he had done jobs for the defendants for a long time and the purchase orders had usually been received after the job was completed. In this particular case, he did not know when in fact it was received. He assumed it must have been received after the job was done. In any event, it was received by the clerk and he was not told about it. Miss Lim left the firm four years ago. She was not called to give evidence. I was not told of the reason. However, no point has been made of this.
Mr Jason Tan's evidence for the defendants, all given in cross- examination, may be summarised as follows. He said that when he spoke to Mr Koh about this job, he told Mr Koh that he wanted him to store the doors as well as to transport them. He said that he told Koh that the storage would be for an indefinite period, and that Koh was to be responsible for any damage in storage. It was his expectation that Koh would be responsible.
It should be noted that the issue as to the scope of the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants had been fairly clearly raised in the pleadings. The plaintiffs had clearly denied responsibility for loss or damage in storage. However, in his affidavit evidence in chief, Jason Tan said nothing at all about the contents of the discussions between him and Koh, except the following:
""I spoke to < Koh > and asked him to quote me a storage charge. I am unable to recall what he quoted me, but I cited $80 per cubic metre to our clients.""
He then went on to say in the affidavit that the contract between the parties are contained in the plaintiffs' quotation and the defendants' purchase order. In his examination in chief in court, too, he said nothing about the discussions between him and Koh. It was only in cross-examination that he gave the evidence as summarised above.
It is noteworthy that nowhere in his evidence, either in the affidavit or in court, did Jason Tan say what was Koh's response to his request, proposal or expectation, call it what you will, that Koh should be responsible for storage and for damage in storage.
So far as the purchase order is concerned, Mr Tan said that it was drawn up after the discussion about the storage. He said that the purchase order was faxed over to the plaintiffs. However, he did not say when that was done. He had heard Mr Koh's evidence that the document was probably or might have been sent to him after the job was completed, but offered no evidence to counter that.
What I have said is by no means a criticism of Mr Tan. My impression is that Mr Tan was, indeed, a truthful witness, and was not prepared to say anything which he did not believe to be true.
After the fire, the defendants made a claim for the damaged doors, not from the plaintiffs, but from Everise's insurers. The insurers denied liability and confirmed their position by a letter dated 12 September 1990. On 19 October 1990, the plaintiffs requested payment of their invoices, and threatened legal action. On 6 November 1990, the defendants' solicitors replied, and, apparently for the first time, asserted that the plaintiffs were responsible for damage in storage. They referred to the purchase order.
On the evidence, my findings are as follows. There is no doubt that the discussions between Tan and Koh were about transporting as well as storing the doors. However, the evidence falls short of showing that a definite agreement had been reached that the plaintiffs were to be responsible for the storage of the doors or for loss and damage in storage. The evidence of the defendants leaves a serious doubt in my mind whether the purchase order can safely be taken as conclusive evidence of the contract entered into between the parties in relation to these matters. The evidence of the purchase order, and the documents emanating from the plaintiffs and referring to ""our warehouse"", should be weighed with other evidence and circumstances of the case for the purpose of deciding whether any such agreement had been reached.
It is not disputed that the price stated in the purchase order and in the invoice was only for transport and not for storage as well. It is also evident that after carrying out the contract for the transport of the doors, the plaintiffs left it to the warehouse owners to deal with the defendants in relation to the storage of the goods. This is supported by the fact that the warehouseman's receipt was issued in favour of the defendants by Everise. This document had been prepared days before the fire and was received by the defendants on the day of the fire, but before its occurrence. That adds value to the document as evidence.
The conduct of the defendants after the fire also supports the conclusion that they never seriously expected the plaintiffs to bear the loss. As stated earlier, they looked to Everise's insurers, rather than to the plaintiffs, for compensation. The contention that the plaintiffs were responsible appears to have surfaced only after the plaintiffs made the claim for their invoices.
Defendants' counsel submitted that the subsequent conduct of a party to a contract should not be used to construe the meaning of a contractual term. However, the issue here is not the meaning of a term of contract, but whether the contract in fact contained a particular term. I see no reason why the conduct of the parties, either before or after the conclusion of the alleged contract, cannot be referred to for this purpose.
Taking all this evidence and these circumstances into account, it seems to me that the defendants really have not, on balance, discharged the burden, which is clearly on them, of proving that the parties had reached an agreement in the terms alleged by them and as reflected in the remarks in the purchase order. In saying this, I am conscious of the fact that there are gaps in the plaintiffs' evidence as well. In particular, there has been no explanation why Miss Lim has not been called. All that has been said is that she left the firm four years ago. However, as stated above, the defendants have not made a point of it.
In the circumstances, it appears to me that the defendants have not established their counterclaim. It must therefore be dismissed. The plaintiffs' claim based on the invoices is not disputed. Judgment must therefore be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $7,500 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum on that sum from the date of writ to the date of judgment. The plaintiffs shall have one set of costs for both the claim and counterclaims, on the High Court scale in respect of the proceedings in the High Court and on the Subordinate Courts scale in respect of the proceedings in the subordinate courts.

 Quentin Loh J:
1       The plaintiff, Resource Piling Pte Ltd (“Resource Piling”), carries on the business of a piling contractor and also conducts related engineering works. The defendant, Geospecs Pte Ltd (“Geospecs”), is a company which specialises in soil investigation works, slope stabilisation, laboratory testing and related works. Resource Piling is suing Geospecs in tort, alleging that Geospecs had negligently carried out soil investigation works and had produced inaccurate borehole logs which Resource Piling relied upon to tender for a piling contract.
Background facts to the dispute
The soil investigation contract
2       HH Properties Pte Ltd (“the Developer”), wanted to develop two hotel blocks of 15 and 18-storeys, a 13-storey office block and basement car parks (“the Project”) on a site between Balestier Road and Ah Hood Road, Lot 09941T Mukim 17 (“the Site”). The Developer engaged Longrove & Associates (“Longrove”) as its consultant civil structural engineer and Longrove required the usual soil information and data to design the foundations. The Developer, through Longrove, called for tenders for the soil investigation. On 15 June 2009, Geospecs submitted a tender to carry out the required soil investigations works at the Site. On 7 July 2009, Longrove – on behalf of the Developer – awarded the soil investigation contract to Geospecs for the sum of $20,500 excluding GST and rock coring (“the Soil Investigation Contract”).
3       The site was divided into two plots by a reserve along which the Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) line between Novena and Toa Payoh stations ran. The larger polygonal plot lay to the West of the reserve (“the Western Plot”) whilst the smaller polygonal plot lay to the East (“the Eastern Plot”). Geospecs conducted a field exploration programme from 20 August 2009 to 23 September 2009 and drilled a total of 11 boreholes on the Site, BH-1 to BH-11. On the Western Plot, BH-1 and BH-2 were to the west with BH-1 to the north of BH-2. BH-3 and BH-4 were in the centre, with BH-3 to the north of BH-4. BH-5, BH-6 and BH-7 were drilled in a line along the eastern edge with BH-5 to the north and BH-7 to the south. On the smaller Eastern Plot, BH-8 and BH-9 were on the western side with BH-8 to the north of BH-9, and on the eastern side, BH-10 was to the north of BH-11.
4       On 29 September 2009, Geospecs submitted its site investigation report (“the Report”) – which included borehole logs for the 11 boreholes (“the Geospecs Logs”) and the usual soil test data and analyses – to Longrove. The Geospecs Logs indicated that rock was only encountered in two of the boreholes, BH-5 and BH-6 (which were at the North-eastern corner of the Western plot), at depths of 18.00m and 18.70m respectively.
The Piling Contract
5       On 5 October 2009, Resource Piling received a letter from Longrove inviting tenders for the piling work which called for bored piles ranging from 600mm to 1200mm in diameter. The tender documents issued by Longrove (“the Tender Documents”) contained the following general specifications (“the General Specifications”):

Site Investigation Report
An extract of the Soil Investigation Report is enclosed in the Appendix for information.
The Contractor should note that he has to satisfy himself as to the actual type of strata, geotechnical nature of the underlying stratum and ground conditions to be encountered during the works. It is to be at the risk of the Contractor if difficult ground conditions are actually encountered on the site.
If a Contractor wishes to perform investigation, which may involve excavation, sounding, or boring before submitting his tender he may do so at his own expense and arrangement could be made with the Engineer.

1.10 
Obstructions
An obstruction is defined as material the excavation of which requires additional effort. Upon encountering an obstruction, the Contractor shall immediately inform the Engineer and shall agree with the Engineer the method to be employed in removing the obstruction.
...
No claim for additional cost or time shall be allowed or excavation through obstructions and difficult ground conditions no matter how adverse or for the removal of boulders.
The Tender Documents also contained the following specifications relating to the bored piles (“the Bored Pile Specifications”):

The Geospecs Logs were included in the appendix to the Tender Documents but the full Report including the soil test data and analyses were not included. Resource Piling allegedly relied on the Geospecs Logs to calculate the tender price and submitted its tender to the Developer on 21 October 2009, the closing date for the tender, which was about 16 days after the date of the invitation to tender.
6       Resource Piling was successful and the Developer awarded the piling contract to Resource Piling for the sum of $3,608,488.41 (“the Piling Contract”) on 24 December 2009. The contract price was calculated according to per metre rates based on the provisional lengths of the bored piles. The material terms of the Piling Contract are set out below as follows:
[note: 3]

Clause 2(c) of the Piling Contract incorporated both the General Specifications and Bored Pile Specifications as terms of the Piling Contract.
The piling construction
7       Sometime in January 2010, prior to the commencement of the piling works and in accordance with the Building and Construction Authority’s (“BCA”) requirements, Resource Piling drilled and constructed an ultimate test pile (“the UTP”). The purpose of the UTP was to verify the pile design submitted by the project engineer to the BCA as the UTP would be constructed and tested to at least 2.5 times of the working load under the pile design. Resource Piling drilled the UTP somewhere near the vertical midpoint between BH-10 and BH-11, and discovered that rock was encountered from 19.00m onwards.
8       Upon the UTP performing satisfactorily, Resource Piling proceeded to carry out the piling works, and claimed to have encountered ground conditions that were materially different from the conditions indicated in the Geospecs Logs. Resource Piling subsequently engaged Soil & Foundation Pte Ltd (“S & F”) sometime around March or April 2010 to conduct additional soil investigation works on the Site. Three additional boreholes, NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3, were drilled. The soil investigation report prepared by S & F dated 22 April 2010 (the “S & F Report”) indicated the presence of rock in all three boreholes, which were located in the vicinity of areas where, according to the Geospecs Logs, rock was unlikely to be encountered.
9       During the course of the piling works, Resource Piling claimed that it had encountered rock in 326 piles, or 77% of the piles located in the areas where no rock was expected. Resource Piling averred that the time taken for boring into rock was 10 to 20 times longer than the time required for boring into soil and that it had to incur additional rock socketing costs which it had not provided for in its original tender price.
10     On 4 September 2010, Mr Foo Hee Kang (“Mr Foo”), the Managing Director of Resource Piling, wrote to the Developer to request an extra payment of $1,188,554 for socketing into rock. Mr Foo claimed that the original cost of socketing in the contract sum was calculated on the basis of the ground conditions recorded in the Geospecs Logs, which were subsequently verified by S & F and found to be inaccurate.
[note: 4]
 The Developer replied on 18 October 2010, rejecting Resource Piling’s claim on the basis that it was not entitled to claim for the extra costs for rock socketing under the terms of the Piling Contract.
[note: 5]
11     Resource Piling wrote two letters to the Developer on 27 October 2010, repeating its position that it had a contractual right to the extra payment for socketing into rock and stressing that the Geospecs Logs were “completely inaccurate”.
[note: 6]
 In a letter dated 12 November 2010 from Longrove to Resource Piling certifying interim progress payments under the Piling Contract, Longrove rejected Resource Piling’s “variation claim” of $1,188,554 on the grounds that the contract price was inclusive of any coring or socketing into rock and covered Resource Piling’s obligations under the Piling Contract and all work and expenditure necessary to carry out the works to completion; the contract sum was firm notwithstanding the amount or quantity of work assigned to Resource Piling. Longrove further stated that the Geospecs Logs had been provided to Resource Piling for information only and Resource Piling was deemed to have inspected and examined the site – any risks arising from the works were therefore to be borne by Resource Piling.
[note: 7]
12     Sometime in November 2010, Resource Piling was allegedly informed by one Mr Babu, the Project Manager of the Developer, that Geospecs would be drilling two boreholes adjacent to BH-1 and BH-11, numbered BH-1A and BH-11A respectively, to prove that the Geospecs Logs were accurate. The drilling was done in the absence of a representative from Resource Piling. The borehole logs for BH-1A and BH-11A did not differ materially from the earlier Geospecs Logs for BH-1 and BH-11 and indicated that no rocks were present in both boreholes up to a depth of 27.02m. Resource Piling subsequently requested S & F to drill another borehole about 0.567m away from BH-11A, numbered BH-11B. This borehole log indicated the presence of rock from 21.50m below the surface.
13     On 21 December 2010, Resource Piling sent a letter to the Developer stating that the soil profile indicated in the borehole log for BH-11B was entirely different from those indicated in the borehole logs prepared by Geospecs for BH-11 and BH-11A. Resource Piling requested an explanation from Geospecs for the difference, and stated that if no explanation was forthcoming, it would file an official report with the BCA that the Geospecs Logs were completely wrong and a misrepresentation to Resource Piling at the tendering stage.
[note: 8]
 On 24 December 2010, Geospecs responded to the issues raised in Resource Piling’s letter in an email to a representative of the Developer. Geospecs maintained that the borehole logs for BH-11 and BH-11A were correct, and that the apparent differences in the soil profiles may be attributable to differential weathering of the underlying rock.
[note: 9]
14     Following Geospecs’ response, the Developer sent a letter in reply to Resource Piling on 4 January 2011, firmly stating that the Geospecs Logs were accurate, and that, in any event, there were no sums due and payable to Resource Piling for the rock socketing works.
[note: 10]
 Resource Piling replied on 10 January 2011, reiterating that the Geospecs Logs were inaccurate and that it was contractually entitled to the extra payment that it was claiming for.
[note: 11]
 There is no further record of any subsequent correspondence between Resource Piling and the Developer.
15     Resource Piling issued a writ of summons against Geospecs on 12 May 2011, claiming in the alternative for: (a) the extra costs it had incurred for drilling sockets through rock; or (b) the actual losses and losses of anticipated profit that it had incurred on the performance of the Piling Contract. At the date the trial commenced, Resource Piling had not taken any legal action against the Developer or filed any complaint to the BCA.
[note: 12]
The issues
16     The parties jointly requested, and I granted, an order for bifurcation of issues and the trial proceeded only on issues of liability. Although the lead counsels’ statements list some 15 or 16 agreed factual issues and some three to seven agreed legal issues, as well as additional minor non-agreed issues, these can be essentially distilled into the following broad factual and legal issues:
(a)     Factual Issues:
(i)       What is the generalised soil profile at the Site?
(ii)       What is the definition of “rock”?
(iii)       Are Resource Piling’s records of the soil profiles of the boreholes accurate in that it encountered rock in the construction of about 326 bored piles or 77% of the total number of piles where no rock was expected?
(iv)       Were the Geospecs Logs accurate in approximately profiling the soil at the Site and the soil conditions in the vicinity of BH-1 to BH-11?
(v)       Did Geospecs carry out its soil investigation works and compilation of the Geospecs Logs properly and to the expected standard of a competent soil investigator?
(b)     Legal Issues:
(i)       Did Geospecs owe Resource Piling a duty of care to ensure that the Geospecs Logs it prepared were accurate?
(ii)       If Geospecs did owe Resource Piling a duty of care, did Geospecs breach that duty?
The parties’ respective cases
17     Resource Piling’s claim rests on the allegation that Geospecs had negligently carried out the soil investigation works, prepared the Geospecs Logs that did not accurately profile the kind of soil at the Site and failed to show rock near BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10 and BH-11 when there was rock in the vicinity of these boreholes, and provided a soil profile in the Geospecs Logs that was vastly different from the actual soil conditions at the Site. Resource Piling alleged that around or more than 77% of the piles in the zones adjacent to these nine boreholes had to be socketed into rock, contrary to what was to be expected when considering the soil profiled in the Geospecs Logs.
18     Resource Piling pleaded that Geospecs owed it a duty of care to ensure that the Geospecs Logs were accurate and reliable and had breached that duty in its negligent conduct of the soil investigation and preparation of inaccurate Geospecs Logs. Resource Piling was a prospective piling contractor bidding for the piling work for the Site, and Geospecs knew that Resource Piling would be provided with the Geospecs Logs by the Developers to tender for the piling contract and would price its tender based on Geospecs’ inaccurate soil information. Geospecs allegedly breached this duty by:
(a)     failing to give a proper and accurate assessment of the soil conditions at the Site;
(b)     failing to advise that there was rock present in the areas of the Site surrounding BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10, BH-11; and
(c)     failing to detect the presence of rocks in the areas of the Site surrounding BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10, BH-11.
Resource Piling alleges that because of the widespread presence of rock, Longrove was able to reduce the length of the piles generally, which reduced Resource Piling’s payment as it was based on measured pile lengths. Additionally, Resource Piling incurred greater cost in pile construction by having to socket the piles into rock, causing delays and construction difficulties. This resulted in economic loss to Resource Piling as the Developer refused to pay for such additional construction costs, alleging that the risk was on Resource Piling under the terms of the Piling Contract. While a number of factual allegations were made in the affidavits and in the course of oral testimony that Resource Piling had not been able to claim extra payments for the additional socketing works because Geospecs had incorrectly informed the Developer that the Geospecs Logs were accurate, Resource Piling did not additionally plead this as a basis of negligence, and I will put this aspect aside.
19     Geospecs denied that it owed a duty of care to Resource Piling as a matter of law. It had only contracted with the Developer and had submitted the Report, Geospecs Logs, test data and results and recommendations for the foundation system to suit the soil conditions, duly endorsed by a professional engineer, to the Developer and its consultant engineers Longrove. The Report with its attachments was prepared for Longrove to design the foundation system, estimate the costs and prepare the tender specifications to call for tenders for the Piling Contract. The Report clearly stated that “the presence of boulders probably due to differential weathering [was] expected within the residual layer”.
[note: 13]
 Geospecs had not been aware, until discovery, that Resource Piling had only been provided with the Geospecs Log by Longrove and/or the Developer. In any event, Resource Piling should not have relied solely on the Geospecs Logs as it only formed part of the entire Report.
20     Geospecs also averred that it had not been negligent in the preparation of the Geospecs Logs and that the Geospecs Logs were accurate. This was confirmed by the drilling of two more boreholes in October 2010, BH-1A and BH-11A, which was witnessed by representatives of the Developer and the Resident Engineer. Geospecs claimed that Resource Piling’s alleged encounter with rock was only reported to it by the Developer ten months later on 7 October 2010 and not when it was first allegedly detected in January 2010. It was possible for the soil profiles of a particular area to differ greatly from that of neighbouring areas due to the differential weathering of different types of rocks and formations. Geospecs also questioned the accuracy of Resource Piling’s records documenting that “rock” had been encountered in the course of constructing the bored piles.
Does a duty of care arise?
21     I first address the preliminary and threshold issue of law, 
viz
, whether a duty of care in respect of the damage suffered by Resource Piling was owed by Geospecs to Resource Piling. In 
Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
 (“
Spandeck
”), the Court of Appeal held that a single test should apply to determine the imposition of a duty of care in all claims arising out of negligence, irrespective of the type of damages claimed (at [71]) (hereafter referred to as the “
Spandeck
 Test”). There was no justification for a general exclusionary rule against recovery of economic losses (at [69]). The Court of Appeal described the two-stage 
Spandeck
 Test as follows (at [73]):
In our view, a coherent and workable test can be fashioned out of the basic two-stage test premised on proximity and policy considerations, if its application is preceded by a preliminary requirement of 
factual
 foreseeability. We would add that this test is to be applied 
incrementally
, in the sense that when applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or policy. [emphasis in original]
I now turn to consider each limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test.
Factual foreseeability
22     Geospecs argued that the loss suffered by Resource Piling, 
ie
, the economic loss suffered as a result of the miscalculation of the tender price, was not foreseeable as Geospecs was not aware that the Geospecs Logs would form part of the tender documents provided by Longrove to potential bidders for the Piling Contract. Further, Geospecs could not have foreseen that Longrove would provide only the Geospecs Logs without the rest of the Report which would have indicated the presence of boulders. Geospecs also could not have foreseen that the piling contractor would suffer losses due to its inability to claim extra payment from the employer for additional rock socketing because of the terms of the contract it had entered into.
23     Geospecs’ submissions miss the point of the factual foreseeability requirement. As stated by the Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
 (at [75]-[76]), factual foreseeability is a threshold condition that is readily satisfied in most cases as the foreseeability threshold merely requires that the defendant ought to broadly know that persons in the position of the plaintiff would suffer harm or damage from the defendant’s carelessness – this involves the establishment of a 
factual foundation
 upon which legal proximity can be founded (see 
Ngiam Kong Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock
 
[2008] 3 SLR(R) 674
 (“
Ngiam Kong Seng
”) at [104]), but does not require the defendant to foresee the precise harm or manner in which the loss was suffered. In the context of a building project, soil investigation works are required to decide on the foundations required for the building. The consultant engineer would require this information and test data to design the required foundations. The information and data would also shape the terms and specifications of the piling contract to be awarded. That this is very important or even vital information and data to the developer and his consultant engineer cannot be gainsaid. If the soil investigation and tests are improperly conducted and the results are inaccurate, it cannot be disputed that the possible costs and time delays, financial and reputational consequences could be crippling. The other parties who would clearly be most interested in the soil substrata would be the piling and building contractors, both of whom would look at the soil investigation information and data. Their contract work, method of work or construction and the temporary works will be materially affected if the information and data is incorrect or misleading. It is my experience, and I can take judicial notice of the fact, that in the larger construction contracts, the borehole logs are invariably included as part of the contract documentation.
24     It was not surprising that Mr Tan Eng Gee (“Mr Tan”), a director of Geospecs, expressly conceded in cross-examination that if the borehole logs provided by the company engaged to conduct soil investigation were wrong, the contractor who relied on the borehole logs to price his tender for a piling contract would also calculate the cost of the work and the time taken to conduct the work inaccurately.
[note: 14]
 A soil investigator would therefore expect that inaccuracies in his borehole logs could cause some form of economic loss – either in terms of loss of potential profit or actual losses from the performance of the contract – to contractors in so far as the contractors would be calculating their tender prices based on an incorrect premise. In my judgment, the threshold requirement of factual foreseeability is evidently satisfied on the present facts.
Legal proximity
25     In 
Spandeck
, the Court of Appeal described legal proximity (at [78]–[79]) as a “composite idea, importing the whole concept of the necessary relationship between the claimant and the defendant”, and cited with approval Deane J’s observations in the High Court of Australia’s decision in 
Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman
 (1985) 60 ALR 1 that the requirement of proximity embraced the notions of physical proximity, circumstantial proximity and causal proximity, including the closeness of the parties, the directness of the relationship between the parties as well as the assumption of responsibility and reliance (at 55–56); the relative importance of each factor and the combinations of the factors was a legal question to be determined on the basis of legal reasoning, induction and deduction.
26     The Court of Appeal further held that the two-stage test premised on legal proximity and policy considerations was to be applied incrementally by reference to analogous situations to see how courts have reached their conclusions for these stages to determine whether the current limits of liability should be extended: see [43] and [73] of 
Spandeck
. The lack of a factual precedent should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor (
ibid
). I note that although the Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
 set out a single test for a duty of care and enunciated a number of broad proximity considerations (at [77]–[82]), the factors to be considered in ascertaining whether the requisite proximity exists depends on the precise factual circumstances, including the type of harm: see for example, 
Spandeck
, which emphasised the traditional test of assumption of responsibility and reliance in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 (“
Hedley Byrne
”) in the context of economic loss; 
cf
. 
Ngiam Kong Seng
, which applied the three factors in 
McLoughlin v O’Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
 within the context of the first proximity stage in the 
Spandeck
 Test for a claim involving a duty of care not to cause psychiatric harm. The case before me is one involving economic loss, and I analyse the factual circumstances primarily through the prism of the twin criteria of assumption of responsibility and reasonable reliance, but with reference to other considerations where relevant.
Statutory duty of a qualified person carrying out soil investigation works
27     Resource Piling laid great emphasis on a change in the legal regulatory landscape in relation to the conduct of soil investigations. Counsel for Resource Piling, Mr Leo Cheng Suan (“Mr Leo”), submitted that in the aftermath of the infamous tilting of the Samsung Hub building in Church Street, the BCA now imposed an express statutory duty for site investigation to be carried out in a proper and adequate manner and made it mandatory for a professional engineer to sign off any site investigation report. Mr Leo relied on reg 31 of the Building Control Regulations 2003 (S 666/2003) (“BCR”), which provides as follows:
 
Site investigation
 
 
31.
—(1) Where foundation, tunnels, site formation (including excavations) or related earthworks are proposed to be constructed or carried out on any premises, an investigation of the site shall be undertaken by the qualified person appointed under section 8(1)(a) or 11(1)(d)(i) of the Act in respect of the structural elements of the relevant building works in order to establish the type and character of the ground and groundwater conditions on which the foundations, tunnels, site formation (including excavations) or earthworks are to be constructed or carried out.
(2)    Whenever any site investigation is to be carried out, the qualified person appointed under section 8(1)(a) or 11(1)(d)(i) of the Act 
shall carry out proper and adequate site investigation
 —
(a)     
in accordance with the relevant standards and codes of practice
; and
(b)     
by conducting adequate investigation boreholes and other appropriate investigation means
, in-situ field tests and laboratory tests to establish the ground and groundwater conditions, their variability and the geotechnical aspects for the works to be carried out.
(3)    Whenever any site investigation is to be carried out in respect of the building works, the qualified person appointed under section 8(1)(a) or 11(1)(d)(i) of the Act shall submit the site investigation reports to the Commissioner of Building Control and in accordance with paragraph (4).
(4)    All site investigation reports shall contain field and laboratory data, and tests and results, and shall be accompanied by a certificate from an appropriate professional engineer who, having carried out, supervised or directed the site investigation, certifies that he has verified the accuracy of the information given in the site investigation report.
[emphasis in italics added]
Resource Piling submitted that changes were introduced by the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (S 54/2008) (“Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008”) to place a duty on soil investigators to carry out site investigation works properly and accurately, and that the intended class of direct beneficiaries of this statutory duty included contractors who relied on borehole logs produced as part of the site investigation to tender for and carry out their works. It was contended that the existence of this statutory duty “enhanced” the legal proximity between Resource Piling and Geospecs, such that the latter owed the former a common law duty of care in negligence in addition to its statutory duty. Geospecs disagreed and argued that no issue of public safety arose on the facts; the present case simply involved a commercial contract which was more expensive to perform than one party had originally anticipated.
28     It is well-established that the existence of a statutory duty does not 
ipso facto
 give rise to a common law duty of care in negligence, although it may form part of the contextual backdrop or be a relevant factor in favour of or militating against the imposition of a duty of care (see 
Animal Concerns Research & Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee
 
[2011] 2 SLR 146
 (“
Animal Concerns
”) at [22]). In particular, the statutory duty may establish that the duty of care does not extend to the losses arising from a transaction falling outside the purpose for which an allegedly negligent statement was made (see the observations of Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in 
Caparo Industries plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
 (“
Caparo Industries
”) at 661D–E and 651F respectively). Alternatively, the imposition of a common law duty of care may support or undermine the legislative intention behind the statutory regime (see 
Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd
 
[2012] 2 SLR 549
 (“
Tan Juay Pah
”) at [53]–[54]). For present purposes, I will confine my discussion to the former, 
viz
, the relevance of the statutory framework under the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Building Control Act”) and BCR in so far as the nature and purpose of the statutory duty may implicitly create a special or close relationship in the form of circumstantial or causal proximity or support an inference of assumption of responsibility, such that legal proximity under the first limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test is established.
29     The present reg 31 was inserted by the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008, and had replaced the previous reg 31 on site investigation which stated:
 
Site investigation
 
 
31
.—(1) Where foundations or related earthworks are proposed to be constructed or carried out on any premises, an investigation of the site shall be undertaken by the qualified person appointed under section 6(3)(a) of the Act in respect of the structural elements of the relevant building works in order to establish the type and character of the ground on which the foundation or earthworks are to be constructed or carried out.
(2)    The qualified person shall prepare and submit to the Commissioner of Building Control a report of any investigation under paragraph (1) containing recommendations on the measures to be taken in connection with the construction or carrying out of the foundations or related earthworks so as to prevent any settlement or other movement which may impair the stability of or cause damage to the whole or part of any adjoining premises or building.
The amended reg 31 extended the duty to apply to the construction of “tunnels” and “site formation (including excavations)”. It imposed a more specific and detailed set of duties on those qualified to undertake site investigation works, including the requirements in reg 31(2) that site investigation works have to be done properly and adequately in accordance with the prevailing standards and codes of practice and by conducting adequate investigation boreholes and other appropriate investigation means: see also the explanatory note to the proposed amendment of reg 31 in Annex A of the circular issued by the Commissioner of Building Control dated 10 December 2007. Further, it engrafted an additional layer of checks in reg 31(4), which mandates that the accuracy of the results of the site investigation have to be verified and certified by a Professional Engineer. Regulation 50 of the BCR imposes criminal liability for the contravention of, 
inter alia
, regs 31(1), 31(2) and 31(3), but the BCR is otherwise silent on any concomitant civil liability.
30     The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008 followed the amendments made by the Building Control (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act No 46 of 2007) (“BCAA 2007”) to the Building Control Act. Mr Leo relied on the parliamentary debates during the passing of the Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2007 (“the Bill”) in support for the submission that the purpose of introducing the requirement for a Professional Engineer to verify the accuracy of the site investigation reports was to “prevent the “Church Street incident” from recurring”.
[note: 15]
 Mr Leo cited the speech of a Member of Parliament, Mrs Lee Bee Wah (“Mrs Lee”), a Professional Engineer and former President of the Institution of Engineers (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (20 September 2007) vol 83 (“the 
20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates
”) at col 2082):
... I queried [BCA officers], in the past, which were the projects where they could show examples that if we introduced the [Professional Engineer] (Geotechnical) then they would have avoided the problem totally. Kong lie kong ker, they could only quote me Church Street. And I asked them which aspect of Church Street. In fact, to prepare for this, I had lunch with Church Street’s [Professional Engineer], and he also told me that he was doubtful with the introduction of [Professional Engineer] (Geotechnical). That problem could be avoided.
The Church Street incident in 2002, which is well known to those in the construction industry, involved the 30-storey Samsung Hub building that started to tilt during construction as the superstructure was loaded, 
ie
, being built. There were allegations in relation to the soil investigation, the characterisation of the soil substratum and possible piling construction shortcomings. It caused great alarm as there were completed buildings nearby. However, it should be noted that the introduction of the requirement for a Professional Engineer (Geotechnical) to supervise specific types of works in the BCAA 2007 followed the inquiry into the Nicoll Highway collapse in 2004 and relates only to “geotechnical building works”, which do not include foundational works for buildings which are less than 30-storeys high: see the definition in s 2(1) of the Building Control Act and the then Minister of State for National Development, Ms Grace Fu’s (“Ms Fu”) explanation of the regulation of underground building works in the BCAA 2007 (see the 
20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates
 at cols 2055-2056).
31     The comments that Mr Leo cited followed Mrs Lee's speech where she queried the need to introduce the requirement of a Professional Engineer (Geotechnical) for piling works for projects of 30-storeys and above as professional civil engineers had been designing the foundations of high-rise buildings for many years, and suggested that the employment of a second professional engineer was impractical and unnecessary: see the 
20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates
 at cols 2068-2069. Ms Fu responded to this concern by explaining that any structural problems with the foundations of high-rise buildings could have very serious consequences, and cited the Church Street incident as an example: see the 
20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates
 at col 2074. It is difficult to see how Mrs Lee’s comments support Mr Leo’s position; on the contrary, Mrs Lee was arguing that the Church Street incident could not have been prevented even with the input of a Professional Engineer (Geotechnical). Mrs Lee’s comments were not directed at any proposed amendments to the Building Control Act that directly considered the duties of those engaged in specialised site investigation works.
32     It is evident that the overarching purpose of the BCAA 2007, and the subsequent amendments to the BCR, were to “strengthen the building control regulatory framework to uplift professionalism, standards of safety and quality in the construction industry”: see Ms Fu’s speech in the 
20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates
 at col 2053. Apart from this broad statement of purpose, the BCAA 2007 was silent on the duties of a soil investigator, although the constant reference to the Church Street incident suggests that it perhaps formed part of the catalyst for the BCAA 2007. (I should add that the Nicoll Highway collapse in April 2004 must have also been a major contributor but from a slightly different angle.) The BCAA 2007 introduced a requirement for those engaged in site investigation works to be licensed as a specialist builder (see s 29G of the Building Control Act) and additional duties on a soil investigator were inserted in the BCR by the amended reg 31. These changes undoubtedly followed the overall purpose of the 2007 amendments in improving the accountability and competence of those engaged in site investigation works to strengthen safety standards. However, I do not think that there is anything to suggest that the changes introduced by the BCAA 2007, or indeed the building regulatory regime as a whole under the Building Control Act, additionally have the statutory objective of protecting the 
economic interests
 of the various participants in the construction industry or to define the scope of their responsibilities 
vis-à-vis
 each other. The financial risks potentially incurred by contractors who rely on work done by other contractors in the same project are not regulated under the Building Control Act. While it is clear that specialised site investigators in the position of Geospecs owe an express statutory duty to carry out proper and adequate site investigation under reg 31(2), in my view, there is nothing that can plausibly support a suggestion that Parliament intended for this duty of competence to extend equally to contractors who rely on geological information provided by site investigators to price their tenders.
33     Contractors are not within the class of persons intended to be protected by the statutory duty to carry out adequate and proper site investigation works, and I am thus of the view that reg 31 of the BCR is of minimal assistance to Resource Piling in establishing that the parties were brought into a close and direct relationship or that Geospecs had assumed any responsibility, as part of its statutory duty, towards Resource Piling in relation to the accuracy of its soil investigation logs.
Assumption of responsibility, reasonable reliance and the contractual framework
34     Resource Piling submitted that Geospecs was a soil investigation specialist and had to expect that Resource Piling – as a potential bidder for the Piling Contract – would rely on the Geospecs Logs to price its tender. Resource Piling was also constrained to rely on the Geospecs Logs due to the short window of time within which tenders for the Piling Contract had to be submitted. There was therefore sufficient proximity between the parties.
35     Geospecs argued that there was no proximity between itself and Resource Piling. The Geospecs Logs contained only facts and did not purport to give any advice or make any representation to third party contractors. Further, Resource Piling was aware, at the time it submitted the tender for the Piling Contract, that it should not rely on the Geospecs Logs but should instead satisfy itself of the actual ground conditions.
36     It is clear from the contractual provisions between the Developer and Resource Piling (set out at [5] and [6] above) that the risk of unexpected, different, difficult or adverse ground conditions fell upon Resource Piling. The Developer would not pay for any extra costs incurred by Resource Piling or grant additional time to Resource Piling should it encounter such conditions. Under cl 1(o) of the Piling Contract, Resource Piling’s rates, based on bored pile lengths, were to include any coring, chiselling, socketing into rock or use of special tools or equipment and all processes that were indispensably necessary to achieve completion whether described or otherwise in the face of practical difficulties or for other technical reasons. At the tendering stage, cl 1.6 of the General Specifications provided that an “extract of the Soil Investigation Report [was] enclosed…for information” and cl 1.2.3 of the Bore Pile Specifications stated that the Geospecs Logs was for Resource Piling’s reference only and that neither Longrove nor the Developer accepted responsibility for the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs if the actual soil conditions encountered were different.
37     Both parties made use of aspects of this allocation of risk. Resource Piling argued that since the Geospecs Logs formed an integral part of the Piling Contract, Resource Piling should therefore be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs as it would have no other recourse for losses if the Geospecs Logs did not provide an accurate approximation of the ground conditions at the Site. Geospecs submitted that it only had a contractual relationship with the Developer and had satisfactorily discharged its duties in accordance with the Soil Investigation Contract. As Resource Piling was not contractually entitled to claim for the additional cost of rock socketing from the Developer over and above the fixed contract sum, 
a fortiori
, it should not be allowed to claim the same from Geospecs.
38     Resource Piling’s argument can be characterised as a claim of assumption of responsibility by Geospecs and corresponding reliance by Resource Piling. Although of considerable vintage, 
Hedley Byrne
 continues to be the starting point in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions for claims involving negligent misstatements. Lord Devlin’s formulation of the test as to when a duty of care not to cause economic loss by making negligent statements arises can be found at 528–529 of 
Hedley Byrne
:
... the categories of special relationships which may give rise to a duty to take care in word as well as in deed...include also relationships which...are ""equivalent to contract,"" that is, 
where there is an assumption of responsibility in circumstances in which, but for the absence of consideration, there would be a contract.
 [emphasis in italics added]
The 
Hedley Bryne
 elements have been incorporated as part of the first proximity limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test at [81]:
In our view, Deane J's analysis in 
Sutherland
, that proximity includes physical, circumstantial as well as causal proximity, does provide substance to the concept since 
it includes the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance
, 
where the facts support them, as essential factors in meeting the test of proximity.
 … [emphasis in italics added]
Assumption of responsibility is to be understood in a legal rather than factual sense. It therefore refers to “the circumstances in which the law will deem the maker of the statement to have assumed responsibility to the person who acts upon the advice” (per Lord Griffiths in 
Smith v Eric S. Bush and Harris v Wyre Forest District Council
 
[1990] 1 AC 831
 at 862; see also the observations of Phang J (as he then was) in 
Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric (practising under the name and style of W P Architects)
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 853
 at [63], citing Andrew Phang, Cheng Lim Saw and Gary Chan, ""Of Precedent, Theory and Practice - The Case for a Return to Anns"" [2006] Sing JLS 1 at pp 47-48 that the concept of proximity is “not merely factual but is, rather, legal in nature”).
39     I first dispose of the argument that was repeatedly stressed by Geospecs in its submissions, 
viz
, that Resource Piling could not claim to have been negligently misled by the Geospecs Logs as the Geospecs Logs contained purely factual statements. The basis of liability for negligent misstatements, either under the 
Hedley Bryne
 principle or the 
Spandeck
 Test, is that one party may owe a duty of care to another not to provide information negligently; it is not dependent on whether such information may be classified under the semantic categories of “facts” or “advice”. I am, with respect, unable to comprehend how this apparent distinction changes the character of any responsibility that Geospecs may have undertaken with respect to Resource Piling or the nature of Resource Piling’s reliance on the Geospecs Logs. In this regard, I need only refer to the observations of Lord Steyn in 
Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd
 
[1998] 1 WLR 830
, at page 834D-H:
It is clear … that the governing principles are stated in the leading speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in 
Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd
 
[1995] 2 AC 145
. First in 
Henderson’s
 case it was settled that the assumption of responsibility principle enunciated in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 is 
not confined to statements but may apply to any assumption of responsibility for the provision of services
. … [emphasis in italics added]
The 
Hedley Bryne
 principle is conceptually premised on assumption of responsibility and a corresponding reliance, and does not turn on minute classification of what was said or done.
40     The present claim by Resource Piling against Geospecs, who provided geological or subsoil information or conditions to the Developer, is a novel one and neither counsel directed me to any previously decided case in a Commonwealth jurisdiction where a duty of care was held to exist on materially similar facts. In accordance with the incremental approach of reasoning by analogy endorsed by the Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
 (at [82]), I now consider earlier cases where the courts have answered this broader question: does a professional owe a duty of care to a contractor where the contractor tenders for a contract on the faith of information prepared by the professional who does so under a separate contract with the contractor’s employer, but with whom the contractor has no contractual relationship?
41     A close factual parallel can be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal of California in 
M Miller Co v Dames & Moore
 (1961) 198 Cal. App. 2d 305 (“
Miller
”), which predated the House of Lords decision in 
Hedley Bryne
. It was alleged that negligent soil tests, which failed to disclose unstable ground material, were carried out by the defendant soil engineering firm under contract with the employer and their civil engineers. It was assumed for the purposes of the appeal that the report 
was intended
 to provide information for prospective bidders, including the plaintiff contractor, and was in fact made available to and relied upon by the contractor (at 307). As a result of the negligent report, the contractor’s bid was less than the actual cost of completing the project. The court held that on the assumed facts, the soil engineering firm could be liable to the contractors in negligence under the rule in its earlier decision in 
Biakanja v Irving
 (1959) 49 Cal. 2d 467, 
viz
, damages for negligent performance could be recovered if “the circumstances were such that the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff and injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable”. The court also rejected the defence that the contract between the contractor and the employer specifically provided that the contractor was not to rely on the soil report but was to make its own independent investigations; the rights and duties of the soil engineer as against the contractor were not necessarily equivalent to the scope of the liabilities that the contractor had chosen to waive in favour of the employer.
42     In my view, 
Miller
 is of limited guidance because it was decided at an interlocutory stage on summary judgment principles. It arose from a motion by the defendant to dismiss the claim against it as disclosing no merit. It was therefore decided as a matter of law only on the basis of the assumed facts set out in the preceding paragraph, including the plaintiff’s pleading that the defendant soil engineer had 
intended
 for the report to provide information for prospective contractors bidding for the project. The summary judgment granted in favour of the soil engineering firm at first instance was accordingly reversed and the issue of negligence was sent for trial.
43     A similar conclusion and reasoning was adopted in 
Edgeworth Construction Ltd v ND Lea & Associates Ltd
 (1993) 107 DLR (4
th
) 169 (“
Edgeworth
”), a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court held that an engineering firm which had prepared specifications and construction drawings for a highway project and the relevant tender documents incorporating such plans owed a duty of care to a contractor who had successfully tendered for the project and incurred economic losses as a result of errors in the specifications and drawings. McLachlin J, delivering the leading judgment of the court, made the following observations on the assumption of responsibility by the engineering firm at [5]:
... The engineers undertook to provide information (“the tender package”) for use by a definable group of persons with whom it did not have any contractual relationship. 
The purpose of supplying this information was to allow tenderers to prepare a price to be submitted. The engineers knew this
.
 The plaintiff contractor was one of the tenderers. It relied on the information prepared by the engineers in preparing its bid. Its reliance upon the engineers’ work was reasonable. It alleges it suffered loss as a consequence. These facts establish a 
prima facie
 cause of action against the engineering firm. [emphasis in bold italics added; emphasis in italics in original]
McLachlin J then considered whether the contract between the contractor and the employer negated this 
prima facie
 duty of care, and held (at [9]) that although the specifications provided by the engineering firm had been incorporated in the contract and had also become representations of the employer, they did not cease to be representations of the engineering firm. The contractor continued to rely on the accuracy of the specifications and did not assume the risk of errors in the work of the engineering firm. The presence of a clause in the main contract between the contractor and the employer negating any warranty of the accuracy of the information provided in the tender documents also did not extend to protect the engineering firm from liability (at [10]) and did not oust any possible duties in tort that the engineering firm owed to the contractor (at [12]).
44     I am hesitant to draw any statement of general principle from 
Edgeworth
 as it similarly concerned a striking out application at an interlocutory stage. The Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
 cited 
Edgeworth
 for the proposition that (at [107]):
… there might be situations where a negligent statement by the professional in preparing the tender documents would lead to liability under Hedley Byrne … but, in the absence of such a statement to the contractor, it seemed unlikely that a court would find a duty of care based on the mere conduct of the professional.
From the very brief comment that 
Edgeworth
 drew from the Court of Appeal in 
Spandeck
, it appears that the Court of Appeal gave a qualified and cautious interpretation of the decision as requiring a statement 
to the contractor
 instead of mere conduct of the third party professional in preparing the tender documents. The observations of McLachlin J (at [5]) that appear to suggest that the professional’s knowledge that the purpose of supplying the information was to allow contractors to prepare a tender could amount to an undertaking by the professional must be read in the context of the factual scenario in 
Edgeworth
. 
Edgeworth
 concerned a situation where the professional provided the information for the specific purpose of preparing a tender package that would be relied upon by potential contractors and was involved in the preparation of the tender package; this may, depending on the facts, go beyond mere knowledge and foreseeability.
45     The New Zealand Court of Appeal came to a different conclusion in 
R M Turton & Co (in liquidation) v Kerslake & Partners
 [2000] 3 NZLR 406 (“
R M Turton
”). The employer, a health authority, engaged architects to design a hospital building, oversee the tendering and supervise the construction. The architects engaged an engineering firm to advise on the engineering aspects, including the mechanical services specifications and the corresponding subcontract, and to supervise the engineering side of the construction. The mechanical services included a heating system that required identified models of heating pumps with a minimum output capacity of 185 kw output under certain specified conditions. There were also fairly detailed specifications on the oil cooler, condenser and evaporator required for the heating system. The plaintiff company R M Turton & Co (“Turton”) obtained the tender documents from the architects, including the mechanical services specifications which it passed on to its mechanical subcontractors NZ Mechanical and George Mechanical Ltd (“George Mechanical”). Turton submitted a bid which nominated NZ Mechanical, who tendered at a cheaper price based on substituted heat pumps, as their preferred subcontractor and George Mechanical as the alternative subcontractor. Turton’s tender based on the specified heat pumps, with the compliant tender submitted by George Mechanical, was accepted. Upon construction, it was found that the heat pumps were unable to produce the required 185 kw output. The trial judge found that this inability was due to the performance inadequacy of the specified evaporators within the heat pump packages supplied to George Mechanical, and these packages in essence comprised shelf items. Turton had to bear the costs of remedial works. Turton commenced proceedings against the employers, the architects and the engineers for the cost of the remedial works, alleging that the mechanical services specifications had been negligently prepared. The District Court allowed part of Turton’s claims against the employer but dismissed the claims against the architect and engineers, holding 
inter alia
, that Turton had assumed the contractual obligation to provide heat pumps which would achieve the specified performance criteria. On appeal, the High Court upheld the District Court’s conclusion that the engineers did not owe a tortious duty of care to Turton.
46     In the Court of Appeal, Henry and Keith JJ agreed and upheld the decision of the High Court that the engineers did not owe a duty of care to the contractor. There had been a careful allocation of risk for the negligence of the engineers (at [26]) and the imposition of a duty of care would “cut across and be inconsistent with the overall contractual structure defining the relationships of the various parties” (at [32]). Applying the principles in 
Hedley Bryne
, the majority further held (at [28]–[30]) that the engineers were not possessed of a special skill that the contractor was relying upon, and there was thus no justification for holding that the engineers had voluntarily assumed a responsibility to the contractor. Notably, the majority distinguished 
Edgeworth
 and expressly departed (at [35]) from the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in finding a 
prima facie
 duty of care that may 
subsequently
 be negated by the relevant contractual framework; instead, the imposition of the duty would depend on a consideration of all the circumstances, including the contractual framework.
47     Thomas J issued a robust dissent, disagreeing with the findings of the majority that the engineers had not assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the specifications or that the contractor had not reasonably relied on the specifications (at [84] and [86]). Thomas J also held (at [109]) that the contractual structure did not preclude the liability of the engineers to the contractor on the basis of the principles in 
Hedley Byrne
, and approved (at [120]) of the basic logic underlying the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
Edgeworth
, 
viz
, that proximity was made out once the elements of assumption of responsibility and reliance were satisfied and the tort law of negligence would as, a general rule, apply unless negated by contract.
48     I now turn to two English cases, a decision of the Court of Appeal in 
J Jarvis and Sons Ltd v Castle Wharf Developments and others
 [2001] EWCA Civ 19 (“
J Jarvis
”) and a more recent High Court decision in 
Galliford Try Infrastructure Ltd and another v Mott MacDonald Ltd
 [2008] EWHC 1570 (“
Galliford Try
”).
49      
J Jarvis
 involved facts that are not found in the usual building contracts. The employer was engaged to provide an office tower for Northcliffe, a newspaper company. The tower was in a prominent and sensitive location in Nottingham and was constrained by planning requirements; the town planners, who wanted to retain Northcliffe’s commercial presence in Nottingham, took a close interest in the approval of plans for that tower. The employer was determined to obtain planning permission but nonetheless wanted the least expensive scheme satisfactory to Northcliffe. The planners, on the other hand, wanted to exercise control to ensure high quality design and architecture and imposed unusually onerous conditions for approval. The employer and their architects, Franklin Ellis, had many meetings with the planners over the planning approval and design of the tower. The employer also engaged the defendant, Gleeds, a quantity surveyor, to coordinate the construction project and pass information to contractors. When the employer thought it had planning approval on a certain basis, it got Gleeds, on its behalf, to invite Jarvis to tender for the design and construction of the tower. That invitation enclosed various documents, plans and drawings and Employer’s Requirements which was expressed to contain a summary of known constraints to assist Jarvis in formulating proposals and submitting a tender. The contract was eventually awarded to Jarvis and many problems subsequently ensued in the obtaining of planning permission. Jarvis brought claims alleging that the employer, Franklin Ellis and Gleeds had been negligent. The relevant aspect of this case involved Jarvis’ claim that Gleeds owed it a duty not to misrepresent that the scheme contained in its contractor proposals would comply with the planning permission that had been obtained and that Jarvis had relied on such misrepresentations. After an 18-day trial on the preliminary issues, the trial judge held that, 
inter alia
, Jarvis was entitled to recover for loss and damage caused by negligence for which the employer and Gleeds were responsible and dismissed the defence that Jarvis was contributorily negligent. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed Jarvis’s claim against Gleeds.
50     The Court of Appeal recognised (at [51]) that the English courts had been slow to recognise a duty of care where a professional agent provides information to a third party with whom his principal has, or is about to enter into, a contractual relationship. However, the court went on to state that it was prepared to assume, without deciding the point, that Gleeds could owe a duty of care to the plaintiff contractor who tendered on the basis of the information provided, and made the following statement of general principle (at [53]):
... There is no reason in principle why the professional agent of the employer cannot become liable to a contractor for negligent misstatements made by the agent to a contractor to induce the contractor to tender, if the contractor relies on those misstatements. But whether a duty of care in fact arises in any given situation must depend on all the circumstances, including in particular the terms of what was said to the contractor.
After going through the facts in great detail, the Court of Appeal held that the factual findings of the trial judge, who had sadly died in the meanwhile, were uncertain and the court was unable to reach a conclusive decision that the quantity surveyor did in fact owe the contractor a duty of care (at [59]). The Court of Appeal therefore did not provide any detailed reasoning for the preliminary conclusion that a duty of care was not strictly precluded, nor did it make any affirmative finding on this basis. I note that the Court of Appeal confined the potential liability to negligent misstatements that were made by the agent 
to induce
 the contractor to tender; it did not include any misstatement that came to the contractor’s knowledge or was conveyed to him.
51      
Galliford Try
 involved a claim by a contractor, who undertook a design-and-build project, for economic losses it had suffered as a result of delays and additional redesign work that it had not adequately factored into its contract price due to carelessly provided information by the consulting engineers. Although the engineers had liaised extensively with the contractor and had provided tender information directly, Akenhead J held that the engineers did not owe the contractor a duty of care as there was no assumption of responsibility by the engineers, who were at all material times employed only by the main developers of the project and had not been involved in the contractor’s pricing plans. Akenhead J further observed (at [315]):
In the ordinary course of events, I have no doubt that an architect or engineer engaged by a developer would not owe any duty of care (at least in relation to economic loss) to tendering contractors even though the latter had been supplied by the architect or engineer with tender information, drawings and specification upon which to base their tenders. The successful tenderer would be considered to have taken the risk in respect of that information. …
The judgment in 
Galliford Try
 comprised some 424 paragraphs where the judge went into great detail to analyse the evidence and facts to see whether a duty of care arose under the 
Hedley Byrne
 principles. His judgment bears reading also because the learned judge was a leading construction silk in his day.
52     Two threads are discernible from the above cases. First, in my view, statements made or information prepared by third party consultants employed by the employer that is given to prospective contractors are not, without more, to be treated as statements or information which constitute 
Hedley Byrne
 type statements, information or advice leading to liability. It is normal in the context of a building contract for consultants to convey information and, without more, there is no imputation of any assumption of responsibility by the consultants. Secondly, the manner in which the various contracts are structured and how risk has been allocated between the various parties forms the indispensable context and is an important factor in analysing whether the contractual relationships show or support intentions regarding the assumption or allocation of risk or responsibility inconsistent with the claimed duty in tort. The various contractual provisions which bind different parties have to be considered. Building and construction contracts for larger projects are all about the allocation of risk and responsibility; often, tied to that risk is the responsibility of insuring risks that are insurable. In referring to claims under the 
Hedley Byrne
 principle, Akenhead J made the following observation (at [190(c)] of 
Galliford Try
):
It is always necessary to consider the circumstances and context, commercial, contractual and factual, including the contractual structure, in which the inter-relationship between the parties to and by whom tortious duties are said to be owed arises. Thus, it is not every careless misstatement which is actionable or gives rise to a duty of care. Foreseeability of loss is not enough.
Whilst factually most contractors will rely on information gleaned from tender documents, including the drawings and specifications, what is relevant is the issue of 
legal
 assumption of responsibility and reliance.
53     With these principles in mind, I now turn to the facts of the case. Four factors stand out in relation to Resource Piling’s claim that Geospecs owed it a duty of care.
54     First, Geospecs is a specialised soil investigator and in carrying out its soil investigations on a site, it must know that three persons or groups would, or potentially would, rely on the information and data it produces. I have already mentioned the developer and his consultant engineer. The developer’s engineer would want to know the subsoil conditions so that he can design and choose the kind of foundations required and the developer would want to know the cost of construction and the time it would take for the construction. The other group would be the contractors – the piling contractor and the superstructure contractor. They would need to know the subsoil to decide on the kind of temporary works required and construction methodology. In the present case, the Developer intended to construct basement car parks which would involve excavation. In addition, there were other buildings and structures in close proximity to the site, including the MRT line and reserve, and different construction methods might be necessitated by different types of subsoil conditions. Underlying those interests are those of the insurers and their specialist reinsurers (who often bear 90 to 95% of the eventual risk) who have become increasingly interested in subsoil conditions as one of the main factors to rate the risk.
55     Secondly, in the context of the Singapore building construction industry, Geospecs would reasonably expect and know that at least the Geospec Logs would be made available to the contractors tendering for the piling and superstructure works. Geospecs initially pleaded that it did not know that the Geospecs Logs would be incorporated into the Tender Documents; fortunately for their credibility, Mr Tan candidly conceded during cross-examination that he was aware that the Geospecs Logs would be provided to the piling contractors to price their bids:
[note: 16]
MR LEO:
Mr Tan, when you drilled the bore hole, did you know it would finally be given to piling contractors to price their tender?
A:
Yes.
...
Q:
But logically, you have been in this trade for so long, you should know that ultimately it will form part of the tender specification to call for tender.
A:
Yes, but how they incorporate the document to the tenderer, we don’t know.
Q:
That’s a fair point, okay. For these contractors, your bore hole would be relied on to tender, correct?
A:
Yes.
It would have been entirely unrealistic for Mr Tan to contend otherwise given the prevalent industry practice. Geospecs therefore must have foreseen and was probably aware at the material time that the Geospecs Logs would be relied upon in some form by a contractor in the position of Resource Piling or the main contractor for the superstructure. It is my experience, and I can additionally take judicial notice of the fact, that in the larger construction contracts, the borehole logs are invariably included as part of the tender and eventual contract documents.
56     Thirdly, although cl 1.6 of the General Specifications stated that Resource Piling was given the option to conduct its own soil investigations before tendering if it so wished, piling contractors are seldom given enough time to carry out soil investigations of their own in the short time interval between collecting the tender documents and the deadline for the submission of tenders. This necessitates piling contractors relying on the borehole logs of soil investigators to submit their tender bids. Resource Piling alluded to this in the evidence of Mr Foo, who claimed that although Resource Piling was contractually entitled to conduct its own soil investigation, it was not practically possible to do so within the two week time frame to submit its tender; Resource Piling therefore had no choice but to rely on the Geospecs Logs.
[note: 17]
 This is the reality in Singapore’s building contract environment, and I recognise that this is a necessary constraint under which most, if not all, contractors have to operate.
57     Having said that, what exactly is meant by “relying on” the borehole logs to price or base their tender bids? In my judgment, there is no mathematical correlation (as compared to assumptions, extrapolation and estimation) between the pricing methods used by piling contractors and the borehole logs. The borehole logs are invariably used by piling tenderers to give them an approximate idea of the general soil conditions. They do not calculate the length of the pile through different layers of soil with different costing on each layer and then build up the price of the piles. They look, for example, for the depth of the water table and whether underground water will be a problem; they may generally see if there is marine clay and if so how thick the layer is, what depth it is at and what the sandwiching layers of soil are; they may look generally to see what the lower layers consist of so that they know if they have to socket into rock and what length the socketing has to be or whether they will have difficulties with ‘soft toes’ at the foundation levels which may affect the end-bearing capacity of the pile. They may want to know if driven piles into the subsoil may cause excessive vibration and damage to neighbouring properties or buildings. These factors affect construction and the time to do so.
58     I accept that if a piling contractor sees a rock layer underlain by softer layers, he will have to bore through that layer before reaching the foundation level and that may affect price. Also, if there are large boulders, measures will have to be taken to avoid any mistakes in construction based on an erroneous assumption that the foundation level has been reached. The presence of rock at the foundation level is seldom a problem as all it means is that the piling contractor should check the drawings or specifications to see the depth of and therefore his cost estimate for the socketing. However, Resource Piling’s case is on a broader front – the Geospecs Logs only indicated rock around one area (the north-eastern corner of the larger Western plot around BH-5 and BH-6), whereas they encountered rock in almost every other area of the Site. I will deal more fully with this below as there are other factors to be taken into consideration.
59     Fourthly, there was no disclaimer of responsibility or a notation or clause – which is sometimes found in soil investigation reports – to the effect that the Report was prepared solely for and for the purposes of the developer and its consultant and that the maker expressly accepts no responsibility towards any other third party whatsoever and who relies on the same at his own risk. The terms on which Geospecs provided the soil investigation results to Longrove or the Developer clearly did not contain an express disclaimer as to the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs. Although Mr Tan asserted that Geospecs had preserved its position in this respect, he could only point to a single line in the Report when cross-examined:
[note: 18]
MR LEO:
Yes. Where is your disclaimer?
...
A:
... “The pile penetration length, may, however, depend on the type of piling system to be adopted, on any inherent special variations of the substrata and on the intended loads to be carried out by the piles. Presence of boulders probably due to differential weathering is expected within the residual layer.”
So this presence of boulders if already found in bore hole 6, so it could have it in any part of the site.
MR LEO:
This would be the disclaimer you are talking about?
A:
Yes.
This statement was clearly not in the nature of an unambiguous and unequivocal disclaimer of responsibility that sufficed to exclude a 
prima facie
 assumption of responsibility.
60     However, in my judgment, although I am satisfied that Resource Piling was not practically able to ascertain the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs and that Geospecs had knowledge that the information contained in the Geospecs Logs would be conveyed to and relied upon by Resource Piling to price their tenders, these 
per se
 are not sufficient to establish proximity. On the contrary, there are at least five other countervailing factors that militate against a finding that there was an assumption of responsibility by Geospecs or a corresponding reasonable reliance by Resource Piling.
61     First and foremost, Geospecs was engaged by the Developer to conduct soil investigations, ascertain water table measurements, record field Standard Penetration Test (“SPT”) values, obtain undisturbed samples to enable tests to be carried out to obtain information on moisture content, bulk density, Atterberg limits, shear strength in triaxial compression and consolidation and other data 
for the Developer and its consultant
 for the purposes of pile design. This was expressly stated in the scope of works in the Soil Investigation Contract and the articulated purposes of the investigation. I accept that once the engineer has decided on the choice of piles and the foundation design based on the Report, information from this Report, including the Geospecs Logs, would be used to prepare the tender specifications and drawings for tender.
62     Secondly, the Soil Investigation Report was 
not
 primarily for tendering purposes and neither was it for any express purpose of enabling the piling tenderer 
to calculate
 his price. The Report consisted of some 203 pages. The Geospecs Logs for the 11 boreholes only comprised some 22 pages. The Report itself comprised 11 pages. The rest, which formed the bulk of the Report, were mainly detailed test data and results, graphs and laboratory test results which were clearly intended not for a piling contractor’s use but for Longrove’s use in designing the foundations. The Report also contained Geospecs’ recommendations for the type of soil encountered and the recommended pile to be used. There was no passing of such information directly from Geospecs to Resource Piling, and neither was the Report addressed directly or indirectly to Resource Piling as the successful piling tenderer. In fact, there was no evidence before me that there was any immediate contact between Geospecs or Resource Piling right up to the time that the writ of summons was filed. All communications took place through the Developer or Longrove.
63     Thirdly, and consequent upon the second reason, only a small part of the entire Report was made available to Resource Piling, namely, the Geospecs Logs. Clause 1.6 of the General Specifications stated that “an 
extract
 of the Soil Investigation Report [was] enclosed…for information” [emphasis added], and it was thus clear that the full Report was not included. It is noteworthy that soil investigation, if properly done, only gives a snapshot of the cross-section of the soil which the bore went through. It does not say what the soil 
is
 ten metres away. If another borehole is sunk 20 metres away, then only a very approximate extrapolation of the 
likely
 soil profile is obtained by placing these borelogs at two ends of a page and connecting the layers. Sometimes, three or more borelogs are used in this fashion when extrapolating the likely soil profile along a longer axis. The point is, the analysis is not continuous, and because this is after all an extrapolation, it cannot show 
exactly
 the precise different soils or boulders or rock which may exist between any two boreholes. It has to be remembered that soil investigation borelogs are by their very nature limited in number across a much larger site and do not necessarily accurately profile the subsoil at a site; that is why employers and their consultants in Singapore always provide that the risk of different or adverse soil conditions is on the piling or superstructure contractor. Geospecs sank 11 boreholes whereas Piling Resources had to construct 442 bored piles across the site. These are facts, general as well as particular, that have to be weighed in deciding whether the first test of proximity can be satisfied.
64     It is therefore erroneous for Resource Piling to say that only two (BH-5 and BH-6) out of the 11 boreholes drilled by Geospecs indicated the presence of rock and that they could therefore anticipate that approximately only 18% of their piles would encounter rock, or that two out of 11 of the boreholes, which were adjacent to each other, indicated the presence of rock and that Resource Piling could therefore safely extrapolate that it would not encounter rock elsewhere across the Site. That was therefore an 
assumption
 Resource Piling made. It accordingly took the risk, in the contractual context, of that assumption being wrong. Mr Foo’s evidence
[note: 19]
 clearly bears out his extrapolation and therefore assumptions he made in working out his tender price. Geospecs also pointed out (in my view very validly so, given the context), that they did not know the Report was not made available to Resource Piling. The Report stated at p 11 that:
[note: 20]
Piles may be founded within the very dense/hard/weathered rock stratum … 
Presence of boulders
 probably due to differential weathering 
is expected within the residual layer
. [emphasis in italics added]
Although this does not say rock can be expected, it clearly opines that boulders can be expected, 
ie
, drilling or coring through boulders may have to be carried out before reaching the layers below them. Therefore, while I would accept that it was reasonable for Resource Piling to have relied on the Geospecs Logs as one of the considerations in preparing their tender, I do not think it can be said with equal strength that it was reasonable to rely on the Geospecs Logs as enabling them to determine with accuracy that only 18% of the piles would hit rock. There was an element of risk that is inherent in extrapolating the overall soil profile of the Site based on 11 data points, and I believe that Resource Piling must have been aware of that.
65     Fourthly, also of importance is that there are different ways in which piling contractors price their works and Geospecs would not know which pricing structure would be adopted as between the Developer and Resource Piling. For bored piles, tenderers can price their piles by length and diameter of the pile with different rates for boring through soil, boring through soft soils (where there might be a need for additives to help stabilise the surrounding soil) and boring through rock or large boulders when they are encountered in the subsoil. They can also make provision for underground obstructions, like old structures sunken in the subsoil. There was no suggestion at all that Geospecs was aware how Longrove would structure the pricing for the tender or that Resource Piling would price their tender purely by the length and diameter of the pile, irrespective of the type of soil it encountered in its construction of the bored piles. I note that in the case of Geospecs, it protected itself by providing that its lump sum quote did not include rock coring and if required it would charge $150 per metre subject to a minimum of three metres per borehole. The bill of quantities issued by Geospecs also stipulated that boring in soil would be priced at a rate of $20 per metre whereas diamond drilling through solid rock or material with SPT results of not less than 100 blows per 300mm was at a rate of $180 per metre. I do not think there was evidence of any close relationship between the parties as there apparently was in 
Miller
 or 
Edgeworth
 that would support the imputation of an assumption of responsibility on the part of Geospecs in relation to Resource Piling’s reliance on the Geospecs Logs for tendering purposes. It had not participated in the drawing up of the tender documents or specifications or prepared the Geospecs Logs with the intention that it be used by Resource Piling.
66     Fifthly, in the context of the Singapore building and construction industry, the risk of adverse subsoil conditions is variably borne by the contractor. None of the standard building contract forms commonly in use in Singapore provide otherwise. This is the well-known and accepted commercial environment of long standing that both Geospecs and Resource Piling operated within. Hence, the terms of the Piling Contract and Tender Documents repeatedly emphasised that as between the Developer and Resource Piling, the risk that the ground conditions may be different from that indicated in the Geospecs Logs lay 
solely
 on Resource Piling:
(a)     Clause 16(b) of the Piling Contract and cl 1.2.3 of the Bored Pile Specifications clearly excluded any warranty from the Developer and Longrove with respect to the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs and absolved the Developer and Longrove from any liability to Resource Piling on this basis.
(b)     Clauses 1.6 and 1.10 of the General Specifications and cll 1.2.3 and 4.2.4 of the Bored Pile Specifications expressly provided that the contractor tendered for the piling work on the Site on a fixed price per metre basis and no extra cost or time would be allowed in the event that difficult ground conditions were encountered on the Site.
(c)     Clauses 7 and 11(d) of the Piling Contract, cl 1.6 of the General Specifications and cl 1.2.2 of the Bored Pile Specifications stated that Resource Piling was deemed to have inspected the Site and satisfied itself as to the ground and subsoil conditions.
The cumulative effect of these contractual terms was that Resource Piling accepted by its contract that it was not entitled to claim extra payment for the additional costs of coring through rock, 
ie
, no extra payment would be due if there were unanticipated conditions that rendered the piling work more onerous or expensive to perform in accordance with the contractual specifications. Also, by contract, Resource Piling accepted payment according to a single variable of the length of the bored piles; this was an all inclusive price whether or not Resource Piling had to bore or core through soft soils, medium stiff soils, hard soils or rock or had to use any special tools or equipment.
67     Given the factual circumstances surrounding the relationship between Geospecs and Resource Piling, including the fact that this relationship was not formed directly but through the conduit of the contractual relationship between Resource Piling and the Developer, I am of the view that apart from Geospecs’ knowledge that prospective piling contractors would rely on the Geospecs Logs to price the tender, there was no other element which would justify the imputation of an undertaking of responsibility by Geospecs. There was no physical proximity in terms of immediacy of relationship, nor was there circumstantial proximity in the sense of Geospecs performing the soil investigation on behalf of the Developer for the 
immediate purpose
 of conferring some benefit on Resource Piling or to assist Resource Piling. As Mr Tan averred – and this was confirmed by Resource Piling’s expert witness Dr Ting Seng Kiong (“Dr Ting”) – the borehole logs were prepared to enable the project engineer to design the foundations and to prepare the engineer’s estimate and tender specifications. Geospecs’ information was thus provided to the Developer for the primary purpose of the planning and design of the foundations; the contractors who relied on the information to price their tenders were ancillary recipients of that piece of work. Most crucially, I find that the overall contractual and commercial context – as the two general threads running through all the factors above – explicitly and implicitly evinces the parties’ intentions to allocate the entire risk of any economic loss arising from inaccuracies in the information provided in the Geospecs Logs to the contractor tendering for the piling work on the Site. This undermines any direct assumption of responsibility by Geospecs to Resource Piling. It was Resource Piling that failed to adequately price for the risk that it undertook.
68     I recognise the possible countervailing argument that it does not follow that Resource Piling is not entitled to claim from Geospecs in tort 
because
 Resource Piling cannot claim against the Developer under the Piling Contract. The presence of a contractual relationship between Resource Piling and the Developer and the rubric of risk allocation in contract need not necessarily mirror the position of Resource Piling 
qua
 a third party professional in tort. I accept the general principles behind the reasoning in 
Miller
 and 
Edgeworth
, 
viz
, that a duty in tort cannot be “ousted” by a contractual duty, and 
a fortiori
 when the duties in contract and tort do not exhaustively occupy the same ground. However, I also do not consider it particularly helpful to frame arguments in terms of abstract theoretical propositions of whether parallel duties in contract and tort are logically inconsistent by the legal nature of the causes of action. In considering the issue of legal proximity, all the facts and circumstances of the case have to be considered. The question before me accordingly is this: given that Geospecs and Resource Piling were brought into a relationship by the Tender Documents and Piling Contract, did this contractual structure indicate that Resource Piling should be deemed, by inference, to have also accepted the risk of the ground conditions being materially different from that indicated in the Geospecs Logs 
vis-à-vis
 Geospecs?
69     In answering this question, I respectfully prefer and adopt the approach of the majority in 
R M Turton
, which I consider to be consonant with the 
Spandeck
 Test. The unified two-stage test for a duty of care in 
Spandeck
 does not separate the questions of whether a 
prima facie
 duty of care arises out of an assumption of responsibility and whether the contractual framework negates the duty of care; both factors are part of the open-textured enquiry under the first limb of whether legal proximity has been established. Of course, to the extent that the contractual structure may additionally be regarded as a relevant policy consideration, it may negate a 
prima facie
 duty of care; this is, however, an inquiry from a different and broader perspective.
70     In my judgment, the principle applied by the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 
R M Turton
 is directly relevant to the present circumstances and correct. The Court of Appeal held that where the chain of contracts had carefully defined the rights and obligations of the various parties, there is little justification for holding that the third party professional had voluntarily assumed a responsibility to the contractor in tort. The allocation of risk in the respective contracts indicate that as between Geospecs and the Developer, in the absence of any exclusion of liability, the general risk of the accuracy of the soil investigation report fell on Geospecs. As between Resource Piling and the Developer, Resource Piling bore the risk of any possible variations in the actual ground conditions as the contractual price was based on prices measured by the metre length of the bored piles 
irrespective
 of the actual subsoil encountered. In this manner, the risk that the Geospecs Logs did not reflect actual ground conditions was expressed to be borne by Resource Piling. In the circumstances, I do not consider that the parties contracted on the basis that the risk could be passed across the network of contracts through a tortious duty and do not see any basis to find that Geospecs had, in addition to the contractual duties that it owed to the Developer, assumed the risk of any losses arising out of Resource Piling’s performance of the separate Piling Contract.
71     I acknowledge that a similar argument on risk allocation and responsibilities under contract was rejected by the Court of Appeal of California in 
Miller
. The Court of Appeal stated as follows (at [4]):
It must be remembered, however, that this contract was one between [the contractor] and the district, and [the soil engineers] was not a party thereto. The fact that [the contractor] chose to assume certain responsibilities and to waive certain liabilities in favour of the district and its engineer does not necessarily result in a determination that its rights and duties as against the engineers were the same. … No mention whatever is made of respondent’s liability for inaccuracies.
With respect, this argument merely begs the question, and I decline to follow 
Miller
. If the soil engineer was an independent third party, and was not a party to or a participant in the performance of the main contract between the contractor and the employer, then in the ordinary course of things, that contract would not have expressly defined the engineer’s 
contractual
 scope of responsibilities simply because the employer has no reason to protect the engineer’s interests. The rights and liabilities that the contractor has undertaken in relation to the employer therefore likewise should not necessarily result in a determination that its rights and liabilities in relation to a third party should not be deemed to be the same, particularly if that third party is also involved in the overall network of contracts within a building and construction project.
72     Finally, I turn to the submission that the proximity test was satisfied here because, unlike the case in 
Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter
 
[1990] 1 QB 993
 (“
Pacific Associates
”) and 
Spandeck
, Resource Piling had no contractual remedy against the Developer if the Geospecs Logs failed to provide an accurate estimate of the ground conditions. I am unable to accept Resource Piling’s argument that the absence of an adequate contractual remedy for Resource Piling in such an event must mean that Resource Piling placed greater reliance on the Geospecs Logs and that legal proximity under the first limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test was therefore enhanced.
73     In 
Pacific Associates
 and 
Spandeck
, the courts held that a certifier of work done under a contract did not owe a duty of care to the contractor to exercise professional skill and judgment in certifying payment for work done so as to avoid causing the contractor loss as a result of undervaluation or under-certification of the works. A crucial part of the reasoning in both cases was that the contract between the employer and contractor, under which the scope of the certifier’s employment was defined, contained arbitration clauses that gave the contractor a remedy against the employer for any under-certification of works by the certifier. The courts therefore held that it could not be said that the certifier had assumed any responsibility to the contractor, and the imposition of a duty of care on the certifier would cut across and be inconsistent with the contractual structure.
74     In my view, 
Pacific Associates
 and 
Spandeck
 do not present analogous fact situations to the present case; they are clearly distinguishable and are of a different sub-category. First, the consultant certifiers there interacted with the contractor throughout the pre-construction, construction and post-construction phases and were active participants in the administration of the construction contract. They belong to a different class of consultants in a building and construction contract. Their functions were also of a very different nature and were set out in the main contract between the employer and the contractor. This is quite unlike the soil investigator who does his one-time investigation, presents his findings and test data and leaves the stage unless he is engaged to do further boreholes and reports. Secondly, I do not read 
Pacific Associates
 and 
Spandeck
 as laying down a rule of general application that a duty of care will not be inconsistent with the contractual structure if there is no adequate contractual machinery that addresses the particular loss that the contractor claims to have suffered. It was but one of the factors (although I would accept, an important one) considered by the courts when assessing whether the proximity test was satisfied. Thirdly, 
Pacific Associates
 and 
Spandeck
 are cases relating to the professional’s negligent performance of functions which, as I have noted, are defined in the main contract between the contractor and the employer. They are not cases akin to the 
Hedley Bryne
 type of factual scenarios involving a negligent misstatement by a professional to a contractor who relies on it in relation to his decision to enter into a contract, where the twin criteria of a voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance come to the fore.
75     Where the very basis of the professional’s duties stems from the main contract, and the professional is entrusted with certain direct functions in relation to the contractor, the availability of a comprehensive contractual remedy governing the rights and responsibilities of the parties in relation to losses arising from the performance of the professional’s functions would be an important indicator that the contractor should be deemed by inference to have voluntarily accepted the limited role played by the professional and that the contractor should look only to its contractual remedies against the employer. In this context, the availability (or otherwise) of a contractual remedy is understandably of some importance. In contrast, the involvement of Geospecs was not expressly contemplated by the Piling Contract save to the extent that information in the form of the Geospecs Logs was provided to Resource Piling in the course of calling for tenders for the contract. The lack of remedies afforded to Resource Piling against the Developer under the Piling Contract does not provide any indication as to whether Resource Piling had therefore contracted on the implied contemplation that it would alternatively have recourse against Geospecs – a party whose “participation” in the Piling Contract was merely incidental – should the information on the subsoil conditions which formed the assumptions for its contract price subsequently turn out to be inaccurate, or whether Geospecs had accepted this responsibility or obligation. Instead, as I have alluded to above, the lack of a remedy is simply another indication of the allocation of risk that Resource Piling was prepared to accept.
76     The present case is instead analogous to cases like 
Caparo Industries
, where shareholders who bought into a company failed in their claim against the company’s auditors for negligence in relation to the conduct of an audit and preparation of a report for the annual accounts, and 
Simaan General Contracting Co v Pilkington Glass Ltd (No 2)
 
[1988] QB 758
, where a main contractor failed in its action for negligence against the supplier of its subcontractor, alleging that the supplier owed it, the main contractor, a duty of care in respect of economic loss suffered by it as a result of the glass supplied being of an allegedly wrong colour. Bingham LJ, as he then was, said at 782D–E:
… Here, [the main contractor’s] real (and understandable) complaint is that Pilkington’s [the supplier of the subcontractor] failure to supply goods in conformity with the specification 
has rendered their main contract less profitable. This is a type of claim against which, if laid in tort, the law has consistently set its face.
 [emphasis in italics added]
Although the effect of 
Spandeck
 is that there is no longer any exclusionary rule against the recovery of particular types of loss, I agree that when separate and independent contracts are involved, absent special circumstances, an assumption of responsibility in relation to economic loss is not readily found between parties who are brought into a relationship only because they are interposed by a mutual third party.
77     For the reasons set out above, I find that Resource Piling has failed to establish proximity under the first limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test.
Policy considerations
78     Having found no legal proximity on the facts of this case, it is moot whether policy arguments may negate a 
prima facie
 duty of care under the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test. However in the event that I am wrong, I briefly set out my reasons explaining why, when applied to these facts, policy considerations will negate a duty of care. It should also be noted that while the Court of Appeal in 
Animal Concerns
 (at [77]) held that the 
Spandeck
 Test does not preclude the court from having due regard to positive policy considerations, the implicit assumption underlying the decision was that policy considerations 
alone
 cannot operate in an active manner to impose a duty of care where there is otherwise no proximity under the first stage of the 
Spandeck
 Test. I now turn to briefly address the policy considerations canvassed by the parties.
79     Resource Piling submitted that the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008 sought to increase the accountability of those engaged in soil investigation works so as to avoid structural and safety issues that may subsequently surface due to improperly designed foundations. There was therefore a policy element of public interest and safety in imposing a duty of care not to perform soil investigation works negligently. It was also impossible, as a matter of practical reality, for Resource Piling to verify the Geospecs Logs by performing the soil investigation works itself, and Resource Piling was therefore compelled to rely on the soil investigator.
80     Geospecs contended that if there was proximity between the parties, it should be negated for policy reasons. It argued that allowing Resource Piling to claim for the extra costs of rock socketing would circumvent the contractual allocation of risk by allowing it to claim from Geospecs what it had otherwise given up contractually from the Developer. If Geospecs were liable for Resource Piling’s losses, it would effectively become an insurer for losses that Resource Piling made on the Piling Contract as a result of a bad bargain. This was not the legislative purpose of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008.
The statutory framework and the objective of promoting safety in the construction industry
81     An important policy consideration for the court under the second limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test is whether the imposition of a common law duty of care would be inconsistent with a statutory duty governing the same subject matter: see 
Spandeck
 at [53].
82     The primary objective of the Building Control Act is to create a regulatory framework that gives powers to the Building Authority to regulate building works and the safety of buildings, implements a system of independent checking and supervision by accredited checkers and qualified persons, and places a responsibility on contractors to construct buildings safely and in accordance with the approved building plans and regulations: see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (16 February 1989) vol 52 at col 668. Section 11 of the Building Control Act and reg 31 of the BCR define the duties of builders engaged in site investigation works for the purpose of ensuring that the relevant work is carried out competently and in compliance with industry practice and professional standards. As I have discussed above, the statutory regime is intended to promote a common denominator of safety standards and competence in the industry for the public benefit; it does not purport to regulate the rights and commercial interests of private parties involved in the construction industry as between each other. I agree with Geospecs that there is nothing to indicate that the Building Control Act and BCR contemplated that all legal liability in respect of economic losses suffered by Resource Piling as a result of Geospecs’ failure to discharge its statutory duties under reg 31 of the BCR should fall on Geospecs through a coextensive remedy in tort. I cannot dispute that it is desirable for Geospecs to meticulously discharge its statutory duties and that this would advance the purpose of protecting public safety, but imposing a duty on Geospecs owed to a piling contractor or subcontractor on the present facts has no rational or plausible relation to this objective. This is achieved through regulatory or criminal sanctions – which are expressly provided for in reg 50 of the BCR – and not through a private remedy in tort for 
economic losses
. While I therefore do not consider that the statutory framework expressly militates against the imposition of a duty of care by reason of inconsistency, I am of the view that there are no positive policy reasons in favour of a duty of care either.
Practical limitations on piling contractors, risk allocation and the contractual context
83     In 
Edgeworth
, McLachlin J made the following observation (at [18]) on the practical realities of construction contracts which merits citing 
in extenso
:
One important policy consideration weighs against the engineering firm. 
If the engineering firm is correct, then contractors bidding on construction contracts will be obliged to do their own engineering. In the typically short period allowed for the filing of tenders — in this case about two weeks — the contractor would be obliged, at the very least, to conduct a thorough professional review of the accuracy of the engineering design and information, work which in this case took over two years.
 The task would be difficult, if not impossible. Moreover, each tendering contractor would be obliged to hire its own engineers and repeat a process already undertaken by the owner. The result would be that the engineering for the job would be done not just once, by the engineers hired by the owner, but a number of times. This duplication of effort would doubtless be reflected in higher bid prices, and ultimately, a greater cost to the public which ultimately bears the cost of road construction. 
From an economic point of view, it makes more sense for one engineering firm to do the engineering work, which the contractors in turn are entitled to rely on, absent disclaimers or limitations on the part of the firm. In fact, the short tender period suggests that in reality this is the way the process works; contractors who wish to bid have no choice but to rely on the design and documents prepared by the engineering firm. It is on this basis that they submit their bids and on this basis that the successful bidder enters into the contract. The fact that the contractor may agree to exempt the party inviting tenders from liability for the design process does not suggest that it thereby should be taken to have exempted the engineering firm. In the scheme of things, it makes good practical and economic sense to place the responsibility for the adequacy of the design on the shoulders of the designing engineering firm, assuming reasonable reliance and barring disclaimers. The risk of liability to compensate third parties for design error will be reflected in the cost of the engineers' services to the owner inviting tenders.
 But that is a much better result than requiring the owner to pay not only the engineering firm which it retains, but indirectly, the additional engineers which all tendering parties would otherwise be required to retain.
[emphasis in italics added]
This paragraph was cited with approval by Thomas J in his dissenting judgment in 
R M Turton
 (at [132]). Thomas J stressed that the limitations in the tendering process necessitated reliance on information provided by the professional (at [129]), and that it was unrealistic, given the fiercely competitive nature of the tendering process, to require a contractor to either refrain from tendering or request the employer to protect him from loss (at [128]).
84     While Resource Piling did not expressly advance a similar argument in relation to the second 
Spandeck
 limb of policy considerations, Resource Piling did allude to this in Mr Foo’s evidence that it was impossible to conduct its own soil investigation in the two weeks it had to submit its tender. I accept this evidence on the realities of the tendering process that are not reflected in the apparent contractual rights that parties are conferred, but do not think that this is a valid policy consideration that would support the imposition of a duty of care.
85     First, while the economic efficiency rationale proffered by McLachlin J in 
Edgeworth
 appears to be an intuitively attractive and sensible one, I would respectfully make the observation that there is no self-evident reason why the rational economic man should be more tolerant of free-riding than he is of waste through duplication of effort. The practical realities of the tendering process mean that the economic waste rationale is purely theoretical and the real issue before the court is therefore one of the allocation and spreading of the loss, 
ie
, who should bear the burden of economic losses caused by inaccuracies in the site investigation reports.
86     Secondly, I am sympathetic to the fact that contractors are often left in an unenviable position where they are compelled to rely on the information provided to them at the time of tendering and can only price their contracts on the assumption that the information provided is accurate. However, as pointed out by Ian Duncan Wallace in his trenchant criticism of 
Edgeworth
 in 
Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 11th Ed, 1995) at para 1.296A:
... [t]he Supreme Court also noted the short period allowed for tendering as a factor supporting [architect or engineer] liability to the contractor. This is certainly a valid observation, and indeed a common-place of construction contracts ... and almost certainly explains the widespread use of “changed conditions” clauses in engineering contracts. Whether or not (as seems entirely possible if probable) such a clause existed in the 
Edgeworth
 contract, however, the fact that tenderers have for more than a century been prepared to tender at short notice at a time when they enjoyed no possible rights against the [architect or engineer] in tort does not seem a reason for introducing a novel liability and transfer of risk (and which would seem independent of the time, however generous, in fact allowed for tendering).
87     The 
status quo
 argument is not necessarily a cogent one in the light of the fact that the 
Hedley Bryne
 principle is a comparatively recent development in the law of negligence. Nevertheless, in my view, it is certainly a valid answer to point to the existence of “changed conditions” clauses or different ways of pricing that I have referred to above in piling contracts. Resource Piling suffered economic losses in the present case precisely because the Piling Contract had expressly excluded Resource Piling’s right to claim for extra payment if additional rock socketing had to be carried out as a result of encountering rock. The practical limitations faced by contractors could be mitigated by entering into a contract that shared the risk between the parties, and if the contractor has entered into a contract that did not provide for this eventuality and voluntarily undertook that risk, I am of the view that this is a policy consideration that should negate an extra-contractual remedy against the third party soil investigator. In 
Spandeck
, the Court of Appeal stated that one of the factors negating the duty of care under the second limb was this (at [83]):
… Among the relevant policy considerations would be, for example, the presence of a contractual matrix which has clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and the relative bargaining positions of the parties.
It may well be true, as Thomas J pointed out in 
R M Turton
, that the court is divorced from the competitive realities of the tendering process, but where commercial men are willing to enter into what may be unequal economic bargains, I do not see why a favourable protective stance should be adopted towards the contractor. Inasmuch as the third party professional may price for possible liability to the contractor, the contractor may also price for the possibility that the contract might end up to be an unprofitable one.
Distributive justice 
88     Geospecs submitted that the imposition of a duty of care would effectively render it an insurer for the potentially large economic losses that Resource Piling may incur on the Piling Contract, which had a contract value of $3,608,488.41. In contrast, the value of the Soil Investigation Contract was only $20,500.00. The implicit tenor of this submission was that the legal liability imposed on Geospecs would be very onerous and disproportionate in relation to the value of Geospecs’ soil investigation works.
89     The Court of Appeal in 
Tan Juay Pah
 accepted, as a matter of principle, that distributive justice in economic terms could be a relevant policy consideration negating a 
prima facie
 duty of care. The Court of Appeal held (at [84]–[87]) that in determining where the balance of distributive justice lies, the court may have regard to the allocation of risk and where available, protection through insurance. In the circumstances before me, I consider that as a matter of policy, the imposition of a duty of care owed by a third party professional to a contractor in the tendering process would not be consistent with distributive justice and would undermine the private allocation of risk that parties have voluntarily entered into.
90     Participants in the construction industry are in the business of managing commercial risks through contracting; these risks are reflected in the contract bargain that each party is willing to accept. Given the minimal contracting price and Geospecs’ limited scope of work in drilling 11 boreholes over the entire site, the extent of risk that Geospecs was willing to accept cannot reasonably extend to cascading economic losses that a contractor may suffer in reliance on the Geospecs Logs due to an under estimation of the costs of the works, something which was entirely out of Geospecs’ control and within the realm of its own choice for the piling contractor. I do not think that a third party professional, who contracts with one of the parties who then passes information on to his contracting party, would be the best party to shoulder risks that arise under the main contract. The contracting parties themselves, with specialised knowledge and experience of the potential contingencies that they may encounter in the performance of their contract as well as the pricing variables, are better able to spread the risk through careful contracting, and I am of the view that the law of tort should exercise much caution and restraint before intervening in such circumstances to shunt the risk onto the third party professional. The risk should generally lie where it falls and where it was intended to fall, in accordance with the agreement of commercial men.
91     I must point out that in this respect, I confine my observations above to economic losses to contractors arising purely out of bad bargains on hindsight, and would reserve my view on whether this consideration would have the same force in relation to physical damage or personal injury that is caused by the negligent conduct of soil investigation work.
92     I therefore conclude that even if Geospecs did owe Resource Piling a duty of care under the first proximity limb of the 
Spandeck
 Test, the above policy considerations ought to negate the duty of care under the second limb.
Breach of duty and causation
93     In the event that I am wrong in my conclusions that Geospecs did not owe Resource Piling a tortious duty of care in preparing the Geospecs Logs such that they accurately reflected the soil conditions on the Site, I set out my findings on the primary factual issues identified above (at [16]).
The Geospecs Logs
94     I first describe what the Geospecs Logs showed, leaving aside all other portions of the full Report that was submitted to the Developer.
95     BH-1 and BH-2 show fairly similar subsoils. After the usual layer of fill (up to 1.40m and 1.90m respectively), there were layers of peaty clay (estuarine) underlain by very soft greenish grey marine clay (marine) going down to 8.70m and 9.50m respectively where, as can be expected, there was no resistance to the SPT blows; after that, there were varying layers of soft to firm greyish light brown clay with fine sand at the bottom of the layer (fluvial) extending to 11.80m and 12.30m respectively, followed by a layer of loose fine to medium sand with fine gravel and clay, a fluvial layer identifiable as the Kallang Formation down to 14.10m in both boreholes. This was followed by a very dense light bluish grey and brownish grey silty fine to coarse sand with fine to medium gravel identifiable as Old Alluvium in BH-1 and residual soil in BH-2, down to 20.30m and 16.30m respectively, with SPT of 100/18cm to 100/6cm in BH-1 and SPT of 100/19cm for BH-2. Below that there was the final layer of very dense light bluish grey and light yellow gravelly silty fine to coarse sand identifiable as residual soil, Bukit Timah Granite down to 27.20m (SPT 100/6cm to SPT 100/2cm) where the bore ended for BH-1 and down to 30.10m (SPT 100/6cm to SPT 100/2cm) where the bore ended for BH-2.
96     BH-3 and BH-4 had a similar profile, albeit with slightly different depths for each layer with a similar end layer of residual soil – Bukit Timah Granite from 19.80m to 30.02m (SPT 100/5 to SPT 100/2) for BH-3 and from 22.50m to 30.02m (SPT 100/4 to SPT 100/2) for BH-4.
97     BH-5 also had similar upper layers of subsoil: fill, estuarine peaty clay, very soft greenish grey marine clay, fluvial sandy clay, fluvial coarse sand with some fine gravel of the Kallang Formation followed by residual soil of silty fine to coarse sand with fine to medium gravel down to 18.00m. This was followed by rock, where a rebound was recorded by the SPT, consisting of highly to moderately weathered granite layers down to 23.20m where the bore ended, with a core sample taken within that last layer of rock. BH-6 had a similar subsoil profile to BH-5 with the last layer of rock extending from a depth of 18.70m to 30.20m where the bore ended. The SPT recorded a rebound at a depth of 18.07m, but showed SPT of 100/17cm at about a depth of 24.00m depth to 100/2cm at a depth of 27.00m. A core sample was taken from 18.70m to 23.00m but no samples were recovered for the last 7m from 23.00m to 30.02m.
98     BH-7 also had similar subsoil layers as BH-1 to BH-4, but to different depths. The same bottom layer contained residual soil of Bukit Timah Granite which extended from 23.80m to 33.02m where the bore ended, with SPT 100/23cm, 100/08cm, 100/3cm and 100/2cm within that layer. No samples were recovered at the depths of 27.00m and 33.00m.
99     In BH-8 to BH-11, no marine clay layer was found but there were otherwise fairly similar layers of subsoil but to different depths:
(a)
BH-8 and BH-9 had similar layers of estuarine clay and peat, underlain with fluvial layers of clay of the Kallang Formation, before descending into layers of residual soils. BH-8 contained a layer of sandy silt and ended with a layer of residual soil of Bukit Timah Granite from 17.40m to 25.52m. BH-9 contained a layer of Old Alluvium beneath the Kallang Formation layer and ended with a bottom layer of residual soil of Bukit Timah Granite from a depth 17.30m to 26.01m where the bore ended. Like the other boreholes, no samples were recovered at the lower depths of this last layer.
(b)
BH-10 and BH-11 had similar layers of estuarine clay and peat, underlain with fluvial layers of clay of the Kallang Formation before descending into layers of residual soils, primarily hard dark reddish pink to reddish brown sandy silt of the Jurong Formation. The last layer of BH-10 extended from 19.80m to 27.02m where the bore ended, with SPT of 100/5cm to 100/2cm. The last layer for BH-11 extended from 22.30m to 27.02m where the bore ended, with SPT of 100/3cm to 100/2cm. Samples were not recovered at the lower depths of this last layer.
100    Resource Piling claimed that this told them there was rock only around the vicinity of BH-5 and BH-6 and they priced their tender accordingly. As noted above, the UTP (which was bored between BH-10 and BH-11) hit rock at a depth of 19.00m. By way of comparison, BH-10 and BH-11 showed no rock and terminated in a layer of sandy silt of the Jurong Formation which commenced at 19.80m for BH-10 and 22.30m for BH-11.
The expert evidence
101    The expert evidence for Resource Piling was given by Dr Ting, the Deputy President (Academic) for the Singapore Institute of Technology. Dr Ting was previously an Associate Professor at the Nanyang Technological University and is currently a Visiting Professor of Newcastle University, United Kingdom. He is a registered Professional Engineer and presently engages in ad hoc consultancy work from time to time, having been appointed a consultant or expert witness to more than 50 projects over the past five years. From his 
curriculum vitae
, it appears that he was consultant for the underpinning works for the 30-storey office development at Church Street mentioned above.
102    The expert evidence for Geospecs was given by Mr Akira Wada (“Mr Wada”), the Managing Director of Asia Georesearch Agency Corporation Pte Ltd (“AGAC”), a specialist contractor for geotechnical works including soil investigation and geotechnical analysis. Mr Wada is registered as an APEC Engineer in the discipline of Civil Engineering by the APEC Engineer Monitoring Committee in Japan but is not a licensed Professional Engineer in Singapore. Both experts were instructed to prepare an expert report based on a number of issues identified by counsel.
103    Under O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed), an expert’s primary duty is to assist the Court on matters within his expertise, and this duty overrides any obligation he owes to the party from whom he has received instructions. This means that while the courts will permit a spirited defence of an expert’s independent views and position, the expert should not stray into engaging in partisan advocacy to advance his client’s cause: see 
Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491
 at [69]–[73]. It emerged in the course of cross-examination that Mr Wada’s company AGAC had subcontracted soil investigation works to Geospecs about three to four times a year
[note: 21]
 and had at least a fairly close working relationship with Geospecs. I would hesitate to conclude from this alone that Mr Wada was in any way partial or biased in his evidence, but my overall impression of Mr Wada’s evidence was that he occasionally attempted to advance Geospecs’ case on its behalf by making certain allegations that had not been previously put before Resource Piling’s witnesses. This was in keeping with his admission that looking out for Geospecs was only natural:
[note: 22]
Q:
Wouldn't that cloud your objectivity because he works with you?
A:
This one is -- one part is true, but if you say like this, most of Singapore, this soil investigation company, is our subcontractor. We cannot discuss with them about engineering matters.
Q:
Because he's your subcontractor, you must look out for him, right? Yes?
A:
Yes, this one is -- some part is human being, yeah, sure.
I therefore evaluated certain portions of Mr Wada’s evidence with some degree of reservation.
104    Counsel for the defendant, Mr Thomas Tan (“Mr Thomas Tan”) said it was not disputed that Longrove changed the pile design after the results of the UTP load tests. However, when Mr Wada went on the witness stand, he put forward the fact that it was actually Resource Piling that suggested the change in design. That caught even Mr Thomas Tan by surprise. With respect, Mr Wada also overlooked what I found to be shortcomings in Geospecs’ case by giving unconvincing excuses:
(a)     First, Mr Wada gave an elaborate explanation as to why samples could not be obtained from the lower levels of some of the boreholes: BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-6, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10 and BH-11. However, he later agreed that the inspection of samples was important for verifying borelogs. Mr Wada then said that tools were available to recover weathered rock in Japan but not in Singapore.
[note: 23]
 However, when it was put to him, he could not explain why S & F managed to recover samples at the lowest levels but could only give an equivocal response:
[note: 24]
Q:
Then how do you explain that Soil & Foundation don't have all these problems with getting samples?
A:
Very difficult to say, but Soil & Foundation also trustable company. I also use them.
(a)     Additionally, Resource Piling managed to obtain soil investigation reports prepared by Mr Wada for other projects (the Singapore Zoological Gardens and 25 Grange Road),
[note: 25]
 where Mr Wada had, contrary to his earlier evidence, successfully cored and obtained samples for Grade IV rock. There was no indication of refusal or rebound before he switched to coring to obtain samples in Grade III and Grade IV rock and he also agreed that generally there would not be any refusal of the drill bit or rebound of the SPT hammer for Grade IV rock.
[note: 26]
(b)     Secondly, Mr Wada was asked to look at the data from BH-11 and BH-11A and BH-11B, which were within a distance of 1m to 1.5m from each other, and Mr Leo asked how the three borelogs could show both rock and soil. Mr Wada struggled to provide any explanation:
[note: 27]
Q:
How can it be possible that within such a small diameter the results can be so far apart, that one is soil and is rock?
A:
Yeah. This one is I also many day consider about this 11, what is the condition. I cannot, still I cannot find out, I cannot get sure idea, because of within three, one number is rock, two number is based on this classification, not rock.
(b)     I pause to mention that BH-11A was drilled by Geospecs to confirm the results of BH-11 but BH-11B was drilled by S & F. Rock was encountered at a depth of 21.50m to 27.00m in BH-11B. Geospecs’ senior geologist Mr Okkar examined the samples and accepted that it was rock; Geospecs did not deny the results from BH-11B.
(c)     Thirdly, Mr Wada did not seem to find anything surprising or strange with the borelogs for BH-1A and BH-11A, which were drilled by Geospecs to confirm the earlier results in the Geospecs Logs for BH-1 and BH-11, for the borelog of BH-1A to state that the soil encountered from 23.20m to 27.02m was “inferred” to be “very dense silty fine to coarse sand with gravel (completely weathered granite; Bukit Timah Granite)” and that no samples were recovered from those depths; and for the borelog of BH-11A to state that at a depth from 22.50m to 27.02m, the layer was “inferred as very dense silty fine to coarse sand (completely weathered SANDSTONE; Jurong Formation)”, and again, no samples were recovered. When Mr Wada was asked during cross-examination whether “inferring” meant guesswork and whether it was unusual to use such a term in borelog descriptions, all he said was that different description terms were used by different companies but his company did not use that term.
[note: 28]
 Even taking into account Mr Wada’s less than fluent facility in the English language, I find this difficult to accept as an objective and non-partisan view.
(d)     Fourthly, Mr Wada maintained that the Geospecs Logs were correct and that Resource Piling’s records collated by Mr Michael Chong Kong Wai (“Mr Chong”) during the piling works were wrong. He was taken through the borelogs of BH-3 and the records for one of the bored piles, BP-93, and it was clear that the two were dissimilar. The records for BP-93 was signed off by Longrove’s Resident Engineer Mr K A Chua (“Mr Chua”). Mr Wada first attempted to say that Mr Chong was wrong and that Mr Chua was “writing wrongly” but eventually had to accept that the Professional Engineer and Accredited Checker were not wrong.
[note: 29]
(e)     Fifthly, I find that Mr Wada denied the obvious, which was that when Geospecs took a whole day to drill 3m, it was drilling into rock, not soil.
[note: 30]
105    I therefore find that I prefer Dr Ting’s evidence over Mr Wada’s evidence where they differed.
What was the generalised soil profile at the Site?
106    Dr Ting adopted the observations in the S & F Report, which stated:
[note: 31]
 
3.1 Site Conditions
 
The area is covered with fills of sandy silt, firm to stiff sandy silt underlain Old Alluvium of fine to coarse and dense sand. The marine clay of 5m thk [sic] in Kallang formation found in NBH-02 at depth 3.5m ~8.5m.
The hard and completely weathered sandy silt were encountered on site.
NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3 each ended in a layer of moderately weathered Grade III granite. The second report produced by S & F for BH-11B, (erroneously) dated 8 January 2010, also stated that “below [the Old Alluvium] layer, completely weathered granite, coarse grained granites are found in Bukit Timah Granite Terrain.” Mr Wada stated that the ground material at the Site generally consisted of three groups of soil/rock formations: (1) a fill layer from a depth of 0m to 1.2/2.1m (2) a layer from the Kallang Formation to a depth of 10.9/14.5m and (3) an ending layer of weathered granite formation.
107    I note and find that the geological map of Singapore
[note: 32]
 tendered in evidence showed that the Site was located in a “transition” region which was surrounded by the boundaries of the Kallang Formation, the Bukit Timah Granite and the Jurong Formation (conglomerate Rimau Facies). The Geospecs Logs indicated both the presence of residual soil and/or weathered rock from Bukit Timah Granite in the deeper layers of BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-5, BH-6, BH-7, BH-8 and BH-9 and residual sandy silt from the Jurong Formation in BH-10 and BH-11; and there were references to material from the Kallang Formation in all boreholes and Old Alluvium in BH-1 and BH-9.
What is the definition of “rock”?
108    According to the National Productivity and Quality Specifications (“NPQS”), “rock” is defined as “[m]aterial classified as grade I to III in table 10 ‘Scale at weathering grades of rock mass’ in [the British Code of Practice for Site Investigations]”
[note: 33]
. It was not disputed that piling contractors in Singapore were generally entitled to claim for drilling into “rock” only when they encountered materials classified as Grade III or above. Resource Piling’s case is that they only claimed for piles where they encountered rock that was classified as Grade III under the British Code of Practice for Site Investigations (“BS 5930”) with a strength greater than 20 MN/m
2
.
109    Resource Piling and Geospecs both tendered expert evidence on the definition of “rock”. Dr Ting explained that there were two main classification scales of rock: the weathering classification of rock from Grade I to Grade VI ranging from fresh rock to residual soil under table 10 of the BS 5930, and the strength description of the rock based on the unconfined compressive strength from less than 1.25 MN/m
2
 to more than 200 MN/m
2
 under table 2.1 of the Singapore Standard Code of Practice for Foundations (“CP4”).
[note: 34]
 Dr Ting also stated that while a geologist may regard Grade IV and Grade V as rock, this was not the case for engineers.
[note: 35]
 However, where the rock was Grade III and above, there was no ambiguity
[note: 36]
, and the definition of Grade III rock bore a general correlation to the CP4 scale based on the compressive strength of the rock such that Grade III rock had a strength of 12.5 MN/m
2 
to 50 MN/m
2
.
[note: 37]
 I accept the evidence of Dr Ting and this is, in my view, correct and in accordance with engineering practice.
110    Mr Wada stated in his expert report that it was necessary to have a detailed soil description as specified by BS 5930 in order to understand the mechanical properties of the ground material, and that the boring logs recorded by Resource Piling were insufficient for this purpose.
[note: 38]
 In particular, during cross-examination, Mr Wada disputed Dr Ting’s correlation between the grade of the rock under the scale of weathering and classification based on strength, 
ie
, a Grade III rock would not necessarily have a strength between 12.5 MN/m
2
 to 50 MN/m
2
 as weathering was not homogeneous and it was possible for certain weathered zones to have rocks of different strengths
[note: 39]
. However, it is important to note that Mr Wada accepted that where the rock had a strength of 20 MN/m
2
, it was possible but unlikely that the rock would be highly weathered rock and it was more likely to be moderately weathered rock.
[note: 40]
111    I do not think that the positions of both experts were diametrically opposed on this issue. Both Dr Ting and Mr Wada were generally in agreement that there was a grey area and that the distinction between Grade III and Grade IV (
ie
, moderately weathered and highly weathered) rock could not be delineated with precision. It was not Dr Ting’s position that there was a strict correlation between the grade of weathering and the uniaxial compressive strength, and Mr Wada eventually conceded that he would agree with such a gradation.
[note: 41]
 Any residual disagreement between the experts over the definition of rock was, in my view, immaterial. I therefore accept, for the purposes of Resource Piling’s claim, that where the ground material had a strength of at least 20 MN/m
2
, this could be classified as Grade III rock that falls under the definition of “rock” in the NPQS.
Were the soil profile logs produced by Resource Piling in the course of conducting the piling works accurate?
112    Geospecs adopted the strategy of trying to impugn the accuracy of Resource Piling’s boring logs
[note: 42]
 (hereafter collectively referred to as “the Boring Logs”) that recorded that Resource Piling had hit rock in 77% of the piles that they had drilled in the zones surrounding the nine boreholes where the Geospecs Logs had indicated that no rock was encountered. In essence, Geospecs alleged that Resource Piling’s claims that they had cored into rock were untrue.
113    The Boring Logs were mostly recorded by Mr Chong and one Mr Kumar. Geospecs contended that the Boring Logs recorded by Mr Chong were inaccurate as he had been specifically instructed by a Mr Eric Choo or Mr Foo to record the material as “moderately weathered rock”. In comparison, Geospecs claimed that Mr Kumar’s logs were more detailed and did not indicate that there was any rock detected even in boreholes that were very close to boreholes where Mr Chong had recorded that rock was encountered. The Boring Logs done by Mr Chong contained a description of the soil, with the word “rock” included in brackets following certain descriptions. In Mr Chong’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he stated that he was instructed to record the material bored out of the borehole as “moderately weathered rocks” when it was necessary to use core barrels to core the rock first, followed by a rock bucket to drill the borehole.
[note: 43]
 Mr Foo also stated that this manner of description was the industry practice, and I accept his evidence.
[note: 44]
 Geospecs seized upon the words used in Mr Chong’s AEIC to cross-examine him on the basis that he did not really encounter rock but was instructed to say so by Resource Piling. Mr Chong’s statement in his AEIC must be read in context and fairly. Geospecs’ cross-examination and submission was that only the boring records recorded by Mr Chong indicated that rock was encountered. That is not true. I note and find that not all of Mr Chong’s records state that rock was encountered. In Mr Kumar’s limited records, he recorded that “[v]ery dense bluish grey and weather moderately sandstone” was encountered for BP-174. Other Resource Piling employees, contrary to Geospecs’ allegations, also recorded the presence of rock. One Mr V. Suresh recorded encountering rock in BP-6, BP-243, BP-365 and BP-369. One Mr Salam records hitting “[v]ery hard bluish (Rock)” in BP-60 and “[b]luish weathered granite (Rock)” for BP-423, and also recorded encountering rock in BP-38, CBP-180, CBP-163, CBP-170, CBP-172 and CBP-171. Mr N. Kumaresan also recorded encountering rock at BP-38. I also note that in accordance with standard practice, and as mentioned before me but not specifically addressed as it was not in issue, some piles would have been randomly selected for load tests; there is no suggestion that any of those test piles failed.
114    During cross-examination, Mr Chong candidly testified that he was not able to visually distinguish between moderately weathered rock and highly weathered rock, but he had learnt from experience that highly weathered rock could be torn apart by hand but moderately weathered rock could not.
[note: 45]
 In the course of his work, he would consider that a rock was Grade III rock if it was necessary to use a core bucket or rock bucket instead of a soil bucket.
[note: 46]
 The soil bucket used by Resource Piling could bore materials having a strength of up to 20 MN/m
2
.
 Therefore, when the soil bucket could not penetrate further and it was necessary to switch to a core bucket or core barrel, it meant that at least Grade III rock had been encountered in the borehole.
[note: 47]
115    More importantly, Mr Chong also averred that when he extracted samples from the borehole, the Resident Engineer on site would verify what was recorded by him
[note: 48]
 and would countersign on the Boring Logs.
[note: 49]
 I accept his evidence. This is industry practice and Dr Ting held the same view.
[note: 50]
 There is no basis for Geospecs’ insinuation that Mr Chong was instructed to deliberately record the Boring Logs in a particular manner merely because the piling records were less detailed than the standard descriptions in the BS 5930, and I find that there is no reason to doubt the Boring Logs accurately recorded the ground conditions at each layer of the borehole. It bears emphasising that the samples recovered from the boreholes were inspected and kept for the Resident Engineer and made available for Longrove’s or the Accredited Checker’s inspection if they so required. The Boring Records were countersigned by the Resident Engineer, who was a representative from Longrove and then lodged with the BCA. They were also implicitly accepted by Longrove, the Professional Engineer and the Accredited Checker (who signed off on the superstructure and substructure).
116    In the final analysis, if Resource Piling had not in fact hit rock, I am unable to see why Resource Piling would have fabricated this fact in the Boring Logs. Resource Piling evidently had nothing to gain by making false allegations; the Piling Contract was payable on a per metre basis and the pile lengths were in fact shortened as a result of the presence of rock at the Site. One of Resource Piling’s complaints was that due to the shortened piles, it was only paid $2,274,063.36 instead of the contract sum of $3,608,488.41. It would also take Resource Piling a much longer time to core through rock instead of boring through soil and they would also have to incur additional costs of rock socketing (
ie
, to anchor the piles two times the pile diameter into the rock layer). Furthermore, after an occurrence like the Church Street debacle, no Professional Engineer or Accredited Checker would blindly or lightly endorse or sign-off As-Built drawings and records showing shorter constructed piles with a significant number having been socketed into rock when this departed from the earlier construction drawings and documents that had originally been submitted and approved by the BCA.
Did the Geospecs Logs accurately indicate the soil conditions at each borehole?
117    On balance, I conclude and find that the Geospecs Logs were inaccurate and negligently prepared, even after making allowance for the inherent possibility of variations in soil conditions and differential weathering across the Site. I accept Dr Ting’s opinion in this respect that although only a small proportion of the ground was tested by sinking 11 boreholes, this was in compliance with the BCA guidelines that the boreholes should not be more than 50m apart and that it was sufficient to generally ascertain the overall soil conditions if the soil profiles were consistent.
[note: 51]
 I also agree, as a matter of common sense, that while slight gradations are possible, large variations across the Site at distances of one to two metres are unlikely unless a large number of the investigation boreholes were sunk precisely along the joints of the rocks.
118    I also find and accept the evidence in the S & F Report and the report for BH-11B, as well as the evidence of Dr Ting, that the site sat in a ‘transition’ region (as compared to sitting within one of the recognised geological formations in Singapore). To the north and northeast of the Site lay the igneous Bukit Timah Granite formation; to the south and southeast of the Site lay the Kallang Formation; and to its West, a little further on, lay the sedimentary Jurong Formation. There were also elements of Old Alluvium. Anyone with some familiarity of Singapore’s geology (and this includes those who practice in construction) will know that these are part of the ten geological formations of Singapore and there are references to four of these formations scattered in the Geospecs Logs. This may account for those instances where rock was encountered in one borehole whilst being absent in an adjacent borehole, 
eg.
 BP-138 and BP-139 which was 3m to 4 m apart; BP-47, BP-48 and BP-49; BP-223 and BP-231 (which did not hit rock) and BP-229 and BP-230 (which hit rock); BP-249 and BP-250; BP-174 and BP-173; BP-169 and BP-171; BP-130 and BP-129; and a cluster comprising the UTP, BP-335, BP-332, BP-334, BP-337 and BP-349, with only BP-335 in the centre which did not hit rock. To this extent, I accept Geospecs’ contention that the subsoil condition may vary naturally.
119    Comparatively, there were many more piles where rock was encountered when none should have been expected if the Geospecs Logs were accurate, 
eg
, the many piles around the UTP, BH-2 and BH-11 which hit rock, and the differing soil profiles recorded in Geospecs’ BH-11A and S & F’s BH-11B which were only slightly over 0.5m apart. I note that BH-2, where no rock was encountered up to a depth of 30.01m and where the soil was classified as residual soil from 16.30m to 30.10m, was completely at odds with what was encountered when boring BP-189. BP-189, which was 1100mm in diameter and located close to BH-2, hit Grade III rock from 17.00m to 20.30m where it ended. Indeed, rock was also encountered in the other piles surrounding BH-2. In BP-188, rock was encountered from 18.00m to 19.285m where it terminated; in BP-159, rock was encountered from 20.00m to 26.355m where it terminated; and in BP-160 rock was encountered from 18.00m to 20.70m where it terminated.
[note: 52]
 As a matter of statistical probability, I find it difficult to explain this by natural variances.
120    The overall objective evidence before me also leads me to the conclusion that the Geospecs Logs were not an accurate record of the subsoil at the lower levels of their boreholes.
121    First, in my judgment, the evidence tendered by Geospecs’ two factual witnesses on the manner in which the drilling and recovery of soil samples were conducted gives rise to the inference that the soil investigation work was done incompetently and the Geospecs Logs were therefore an inaccurate reflection of the ground conditions on the Site. The majority of the field exploration and drilling work from August 2009 to September 2009 for BH-1 to BH-11 was supervised by Mr Tun Tun Latt (“Mr Tun Tun”), who was employed as the Site Geologist. Mr Tun Tun gave evidence that he collected soil samples and recorded the field logs based on the collected samples.
[note: 53]
 The Senior Geologist Mr Okkar would then double check Mr Tun Tun’s field logs against the sample collected and would occasionally make corrections.
[note: 54]
 Mr Tun Tun stated that it was Geospecs’ practice to continue drilling if there was some penetration, and he would only core if there was a total rebound after conducting the SPT.
[note: 55]
 This procedure was confirmed by Mr Okkar.
[note: 56]
 Mr Okkar visited the site about four times when the field exploration work was conducted.
[note: 57]
 Mr Okkar was also responsible for compiling the Geospecs Logs in accordance with the requirements of BS 5930
[note: 58]
 and he stated that he would thoroughly check the field logs recorded by Mr Tun Tun against each sample.
[note: 59]
 Mr Okkar claimed that if the field logs were inaccurate, he had enough experience to recognise that the materials recorded did not correspond with the materials that would be expected at that level based on the profiles of neighbouring areas.
[note: 60]
 I do not accept this at all.
122    Mr Tun Tun, who only had less than three years’ work experience in Singapore, relied largely on instructions from Mr Okkar, who was rarely present. Mr Tun Tun was aware of the termination criteria for the boreholes but could not independently decide whether drilling should be terminated and had to refer to Mr Okkar for instructions
[note: 61]
, although Mr Okkar was not onsite to satisfy himself as to the actual ground conditions. Mr Tun Tun also stated that while he had experience in soil description, he had little experience in either conducting rock coring or recording rock descriptions.
[note: 62]
 I also note that although the Geospecs Logs were certified by a Professional Engineer Mr Cecil Sinnadurai (“Mr Sinnadurai”), Mr Okkar confirmed that Mr Sinnadurai was not present at the site and had relied on feedback from Mr Okkar that all procedures were correctly followed.
[note: 63]
 I note that Mr Sinnadurai, who was in the full-time employment of Geospecs, was not called as a witness.
123    Dr Ting pointed out that CP4 cautioned that where Bukit Timah Granite was concerned, it was important to distinguish between Grades III, IV, V and VI as the engineering properties of each grade were very different. The weathered granite found in Singapore generally consisted of a thick mantle of residual Grade VI, and there was only a limited amount of Grade V and Grade IV material before hitting Grade III rock. It was therefore necessary to take frequent samples to correctly classify the grade of the ground materials.
[note: 64]
 However, as noted above, as a result of the drilling procedures followed by Mr Tun Tun and Mr Okkar, proper samples had not been retrieved at the lower depths. Samples were not recovered from 24.00m to 30.01m for BH-2, from 24.00m to 30.02m for BH-3, from 27.00m to 30.02m for BH-4, from 27.00m to 33.02m for BH-7, from 24.00m to 25.52m for BH-8, from 21.00m to 26.01m for BH-9, from 24.00m to 27.02m for BH-10, and from 27.00m to 27.02m for BH-11. Mr Okkar, who was personally involved in the fieldwork for BH-1A and BH-11A, also did not attempt to core to recover any samples at the lower layers. I have also referred to the highly unusual notations which state that the soil was “inferred” since no samples were retrieved. For BH-1A, there was no recovery from 24.00m to 27.02m, and for BH-11A, there was no recovery from 24.00m to 27.02m. Mr Okkar also gave evidence that it took an entire day to drill the last three metres of BH-1A
[note: 65]
 and BH-11A.
[note: 66]
124    I find that the recording of the soil profiles at the lower depth in the Geospecs Logs was more likely to be based on guesswork as no proper samples were retrieved for verification. Dr Ting stated that where only a small sample was obtained it may be insufficient for an inexperienced person to ascertain whether the sample formed part of a rock layer, and that it was necessary to obtain a core to confirm the nature of the material.
[note: 67]
 Mr Wada accepted that where the penetration was limited, for example 2 cm, it was not possible to obtain a sample by conducting the SPT.
[note: 68]
 Mr Okkar “inferred” the characteristics of the soil layer by observing the particles that were flushed out from the boreholes together with the return water
[note: 69]
, and claimed that this was more accurate than coring.
[note: 70]
 I do not accept this at all. It appears on the face of the Geospecs Logs that where samples were not recovered, Mr Tun Tun had simply assumed that the soil characteristics at the lower depths were similar to those of the samples recovered from the preceding layer, although Mr Okkar stated that Mr Tun Tun followed the same procedure of observing particles in the return water.
[note: 71]
 I am unable to accept that this is a proper or scientific method of classifying the type and strength of material found within a defined layer, particularly if I accept Mr Wada’s expert evidence that any particular layer may consist of material of differing weathering grades and strengths. In other words, a residual particle may not necessarily represent the overall soil condition of that layer.
125    I find that Mr Tun Tun was inexperienced and incapable of dealing with subsoil investigation when he reached the rock layers at lower depths. When he was asked how he had managed to describe the soil layers when he had not recovered any samples, his honest answer was that he did not know exactly and had assumed it was the same as the layer above from which he obtained his last sample.
[note: 72]
 Mr Tun Tun also testified that Mr Okkar wrote the words “rebound” in the borelogs for BH-5 and BH-6 before the rock coring results were stated.
[note: 73]
 Overall, I am of the impression that Mr Tun Tun’s answers in cross-examination clearly demonstrate his inexperience and inability to independently handle the soil investigation when it reached the rock level, and Mr Okkar had to correct Mr Tun Tun’s descriptions when rock samples were recovered in both BH-5 and BH-6. Based on Mr Okkar’s evidence, I also find that he was not properly supervising Mr Tun Tun in carrying out the soil investigation work and had not performed his duties competently in failing to recognise Mr Tun Tun’s deficiencies. Further, Mr Okkar was himself responsible for carrying out the investigation works for BH-1A and BH-11A, and as I have observed above, Mr Okkar only “inferred” the soil layers and likewise did not recover samples. Based on Mr Okkar’s evidence, I consider that it was possible that Geospecs’ Professional Engineer, Mr Sinnadurai, was signing off the report without checking whether the soil investigation was done in accordance with the applicable standards. My findings are made on a balance of probabilities and I say no more as Mr Sinnadurai was not called as a witness and did not have a chance to say anything in his defence.
126    Secondly, after the test results were obtained from the UTP, the design of the bored piles was changed. It was common ground that Longrove changed the pile designs after the UTP was constructed (on 22 January 2010), load tested (from 30 January to 5 February 2010) and the test results compiled in a report dated 10 February 2010 (“the UTP Report”). There was an attempt by Mr Wada, while giving additional evidence in testimony, to say that this change was proposed by Resource Piling.
[note: 74]
 This fact was never put to Mr Foo or to Dr Ting.
[note: 75]
 Mr Leo quite rightly lodged his protest. However at the end of the day, I do not think it makes much difference who first proposed the design change. Even if this was initiated by Resource Piling, they were but reporting on the test results of the UTP which clearly showed much higher mobilised skin friction than that assumed in the drawings that were issued for tender. In the UTP Report, under the heading “RECOMMENDATION”, Resource Piling stated:
[note: 76]
On the safe side, adapt the following procedure:
i.    Compute the pile length of bore pile base on ultimate skin friction of 2.5N for soil, 450KN/m
2
 for sandstone and end bearing of 8,000 kNm
2
, copy of the pile length calculation is enclosed in Appendix D
ii.    Prior to obtain approval from BCA, construct bore pile base on the length stated in the pile layout plan. Pile length calculation base on parameter stated in the drawing. Skin friction : 2N; end bearing : 8000is enclose in appendix E.
In the final analysis, Longrove must have accepted or agreed to the recommendation (with minor amendments) and Longrove and the Accredited Checker would have signed off on the proposal and sent it on to the BCA for approval. This new design was approved by the BCA. In the original design, the skin friction of the soil was 2 N KPa subject to a maximum value of 200 KN/m
2
, but the engineer subsequently increased the skin friction to 2.5 N KPa (for soil) subject to a maximum value of 450 KN/m
2
. Under CP4, a maximum value of 150 KN/m
2 
is permitted for soils of Bukit Timah granite and sedimentary Jurong Formation, and a maximum of 300 KN/m
2 
for dense or hard cemented soil in Old Alluvium. Higher maximum values may be adopted if sufficient load tests were conducted in similar soil condition.
[note: 77]
 The 450kN/m
2
 was supported by the UTP test results and at that time, Resource Piling would not have known that they would hit rock in the construction of some 302 out of their 391 bored piles. What is undeniable and not challenged by Mr Thomas Tan was that Longrove’s original design for tender had used a skin friction of 2 N KPa subject to a maximum of 200 kN/m
2
 with design pile lengths varying from 22.60m to 34.00m
[note: 78]
. Under the subsequent design, the skin friction increased to 2.5N subject to a maximum of 450 kN/m
2
 with design pile lengths varying from 16.80m to 27.20m. After the redesign, the piles were also divided into eleven sub-zones based on the location of the boreholes.
[note: 79]
127    According to Mr Foo, the increase of the skin friction in the design above 300 KN/m
2
 would not have been permitted by the BCA unless the material surrounding the piles was rock.
[note: 80]
 Mr Tan agreed that calculations with 450 kN/m
2
 skin friction meant skin friction in rock.
[note: 81]
 I accept that the increase in skin friction must have meant that Longrove recognised that the ground conditions were different from what was originally indicated in the Geospecs Logs at the time that the piles were initially designed. The end bearing load value was unchanged at 8.0 MPa, but I am not convinced by Geospecs’ contention that the end bearing load value must have remained unchanged because the engineer found that the Geospecs Logs were sufficiently accurate for design purposes. I accept Dr Ting’s evidence that the engineer did not have sufficient information to determine whether the pile could bear an increased end bearing load as the UTP did not fail, and that there was therefore no reason to redesign the pile on this basis.
[note: 82]
 The consequence would be that the pile was slightly overdesigned but the value would remain safe.
[note: 83]
 It must be remembered that after the UTP test results, no one would know whether rock would be encountered elsewhere as well. If the bored piles did encounter rock, then the socketing requirement (twice the bored pile diameter) would take effect and the end bearing would be much higher than 8.0 MPa
[note: 84]
. The fact that the end bearing load was not changed is at most a neutral factor. Additionally, the shorter lengths of the piles could be attributed to the fact that the skin friction was higher than was originally anticipated under the Geospecs Logs as the actual surrounding material was rock instead of soil. The piles could therefore be shortened accordingly.
128    There would be no reason for the pile designs to be changed by Longrove, an independent third party, and neither would the revised designs have been approved by the BCA if Resource Piling had not in fact encountered ground conditions that were different from those recorded in the Geospecs Logs. Although Mr Tan contended that the new designs of the piles were still based on the SPT indicated in the Geospecs Logs
[note: 85]
, he acknowledged that the increase in the skin friction to a maximum value of 450KN/m
2
 meant that the engineers were basing the design on the capacity of rock instead of soil.
[note: 86]
 It is an uncontroverted fact that the design was changed, and I find that the new design had been calculated on the basis that Longrove accepted that the ground conditions encountered at the lower layers were in fact rock instead of soil (as recorded in the Geospecs Logs).
129    Thirdly, I find on a balance of probabilities that the S & F Report and their borehole logs were accurate. NBH-1 was drilled in the vicinity of BH-10 and the UTP, and a layer of moderately weathered Grade III greyish pink granite spotted with black and white minerals was encountered from 19.80m. NBH-2 was located near BH-3 and the layer extending from 19.50m to 26.50m consisted of moderately weathered Grade III light greenish grey granite spotted with black, white and pink minerals. NBH-3 was located near BH-4 and moderately weathered Grade III light greenish grey granite spotted with black and white minerals was encountered from 26.30m to 33.30m.
[note: 87]
 After Geospecs drilled BH-11A, S & F also drilled BH-11B 0.567m away from BH-11A. The borehole log for BH-11B indicated that moderately weathered Grade III light grey spotted with black and light pink coloured Bukit Timah Granite was encountered at a depth of 21.50m.
[note: 88]
 This was followed by a layer of slightly weathered Grade III spotted with black and light pink coloured light grey Bukit Timah Granite at 24.90m, and a layer of moderately weathered Grade III Bukit Timah Granite from 25.50m to 27.00m. Samples for all four boreholes were recovered at every level.
130    Geospecs submitted that the exact geographic coordinates were not available for NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3, and that it was impossible to verify whether the boreholes were in fact drilled on the precise locations on the Site where the S & F Report had claimed that they were drilled. Geospecs also claimed that the accuracy of the S & F Report was suspect as Mr Ng Dick Young (“Mr Ng”) – who was a director of S & F and gave evidence on behalf of Resource Piling – had not been present when the fieldwork for NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3 was done and did not personally verify the samples recovered onsite.
131    I do not think that either of these points seriously undermines the accuracy or reliability of the borelogs prepared by S & F. While the precise coordinates were not recorded, I am satisfied that the location plan, which was plotted by S & F’s geologist, provided a sufficient approximation of which zone each borehole was drilled in. NBH-1 was set between BP-359 and the UTP and it was surrounded by BP-437, BP-348 and BP-360; NBH-2 was surrounded by BH-3, BP-71, BP-52, BP-56 and BP-75 and NBH-3 was surrounded by BH-4, BP-202, BP-198, BP-176, BP-177, BP-179, BP-203 and BP-204. S & F was an independent third party and Geospecs quite rightly did not challenge their impartiality at any point in cross-examination, and I do not see any ground for suspecting that the locations indicated in the S & F Report were misrepresented. I also do not think that I can draw any conclusions from the fact that Mr Ng was not personally involved in the fieldwork. Mr Ng testified that he had looked at photographs of the rock cores recovered before certifying the S & F Report
[note: 89]
, and I cannot realistically draw any inference that the borehole logs were inaccurate or that the fieldwork was not conducted properly merely because Mr Ng was not personally involved in the recording and compilation of the borehole logs.
132    I pause to make my findings on Mr Ng’s evidence. Mr Ng was first cross-examined on 26 June 2012. It was evident that something was amiss because he looked quite distracted and disturbed when he came on the stand. It appears that he rushed down to court and when his driver stopped at the front of the court, a policeman came up and fined his driver. His text message to Mr Leo’s junior read: “I came here but was fined by the courts when my driver stopped me. I don’t think I am in the right frame of mind to attend the court.” I acceded to Mr Leo’s request to halt proceedings for five to ten minutes while he tried to calm Mr Ng down. Nonetheless, even after that short break, it certainly looked as if some of Mr Thomas Tan’s questions were not registering and Mr Ng’s answers were suspect. I noted this at the end of the day. The next day, Mr Ng appeared to have recovered and was able to respond to the questions fielded to him very coherently.
133    I find Geospecs’ attack on Mr Ng’s absence from the Site and the conduct of the drilling and recording of the borelogs by Mr Ng’s staff somewhat ironic in view of what went on in Geospecs’ own soil investigation. The inevitable commercial pressures put on engineers involved in geotechnical soil investigation means they cannot be at each and every site. I accept the evidence of Mr Ng and the accuracy of S & F’s soil investigation results. S & F is an established soil investigation outfit and has been an ISO 9000 certified company since the late 1990s. Its staff members are trained and operating procedures are in place. Mr Wada acknowledged its reputation. I also accept and agree with the evidence of Mr Ng that there are different types of sampling methods that can be employed for different s conditions
[note: 90]
; if no sample is recovered with one method, another method should be employed.
[note: 91]
 A sample can be recovered by using a core barrel to core and Mr Ng stated that where there was a possibility that the lower layers contained moderately weathered material, they would core to retrieve a sample
[note: 92]
. Even Mr Tan, Geospecs’ director, agreed that where the SPT penetration was 1cm or 2cm, using a core barrel would give him a chance to recover a sample.
[note: 93]
 Mr Ng did not directly receive his instructions from Resource Piling and did not know of the background to this particular soil investigation.
[note: 94]
 I find the recording of the S & F borelogs, sample retrieval and core identification much more professional than Geospecs’ work. They retrieved samples where Geospecs did not or could not.
134    In my judgment, the borelog for BH-11B is also irreconcilable with the borelogs for BH-11 and BH-11A. All three boreholes were at most 1.5m apart. BH-11B indicated that there was Grade III Bukit Timah Granite from 21.50m to 27.00m. Mr Okkar
[note: 95]
 and Mr Wada
[note: 96]
 both accepted the accuracy of BH-11B. In contrast, BH-11 indicated that residual soil in the form of silty fine to coarse sand with fine to medium gravel was encountered from 17.20m to 22.30m and residual soil in the form of sandy silt from the Jurong Formation from 22.30m to 27.02m; samples were not recovered from 27.00m to 27.02m. BH-11A indicated that the layer from a depth of 20.40m to 22.50m contained residual soil in the form of silty fine to medium sand, and from 22.50m to 27.02m, it was inferred that this layer contained completely weathered sandstone from the Jurong Formation; samples were not recovered from 24.00m to 27.02m.
135    Mr Okkar averred that he had used the same method to drill BH-11A as Mr Tun Tun did for BH-11; he continued drilling as there was no rebound when the SPT was conducted and took about one day to drill the three metres from 24.00m to 27.02m.
[note: 97]
 No samples were recovered from a depth of 24.00m and Mr Okkar explained that he had “inferred” the soil description from the sand contained in the return water from the borehole.
[note: 98]
 While Mr Okkar contended that it was possible to find a wide variance in the properties of soil within a short distance, it appears to me that at the same level, 
ie
, from about 22.00m to 27.00m, both the physical properties and the geological nature of the rock formations differed rather widely across the three boreholes. I would also observe, as noted above, that Geospecs’ own expert witness Dr Wada conceded that he could not explain this difference.
[note: 99]
 As complete samples of the rock core were recovered for BH-11B and seen and accepted by both Mr Okkar
[note: 100]
 and Dr Ting
[note: 101]
, I find that BH-11B was a more accurate reflection of the soil profile within that specific area. Mr Okkar had no other option but to accept the findings of S & F, including the rock samples recovered, notwithstanding that the results clearly differed from the borehole logs produced by Geospecs for BH-11 and BH-11A. The latter had the notation “inferred” in the description of the final soil layer when Geospecs failed to recover a sample. In my experience I have never seen a borelog of a soil investigator which infers the soil in a layer.
136    On balance, I therefore accept the veracity and accuracy of the borehole logs produced by S & F. It is an independent and reputable soil investigation company and had no reason to be partial to any party. I acknowledge that the soil investigation work by S & F covered a much more limited area, but it suffices to illustrate that the methods adopted by Geospecs contributed to a higher probability that the soil conditions at the lower layers were not correctly determined by Geospecs.
137    Fourthly, as between Dr Ting’s and Mr Wada’s expert opinions on whether the Geospecs Logs were accurate and the reasons for the disparity between the different sets of records of the soil profile of the Site, I prefer Dr Ting’s evidence. Dr Ting expressed the view that the reason for the disparity between the Geospecs Logs and the Boring Logs at the lower levels was because Mr Tun Tun had failed to core when the SPT values fell below 100/3 cm and had continued to drill instead.
[note: 102]
 As a result, no samples could be recovered and the geologist was unable to make an assessment as to whether the layer contained soil or rock, and the layers (with SPT values below 100/3 cm) that had been described as Grade VI residual soil in BH-1 to BH-11 could in fact have been Grade III or Grade IV rock.
[note: 103]
 It was possible for the tungsten carbide drill used by Geospecs to cut through weaker Grade III rock.
[note: 104]
 Dr Ting also explained that while certain bored piles did not hit rock, the pile length was shorter than the depth at which the rock layer started; consequently, while no rock was encountered, it could not be concluded that there was no rock at the deeper levels of the cross-section.
[note: 105]
 Dr Ting’s overall position was that while the SPT values recorded in the Geospecs Logs were correct
[note: 106]
, the description and classification of the ground materials were incorrect.
[note: 107]
 Mr Wada opined that the Geospecs Logs could be trusted and that the engineers had accepted it as a matter of judgment although there had been no physical recovery of samples.
[note: 108]
 While Mr Wada did not respond directly to Dr Ting’s explanation as to why the soil had possibly been described inaccurately at the lower levels, Mr Wada suggested that the Site was a boulder area based on the borehole logs for BH-5 and BH-6.
[note: 109]
138    I also accept Dr Ting’s evidence (which relied on CP4) that where Bukit Timah Granite is concerned, it is particularly important to distinguish between Grades II, IV, V and VI as there is a significant difference in the engineering behaviour of each of these grades. As noted above, CP4 also states that typically there is only limited Grade V and Grade IV material below the usual thick layer of residual soil and recommends careful and frequent sampling once the penetrational resistance in the SPT reaches 30 blows/300mm.
[note: 110]
 This was something Geospecs clearly failed to do.
139    With respect, I find Mr Wada’s expert evidence of limited assistance in explaining the disparity between the Geospecs Logs and the Boring Logs. I accept that differential weathering and the possibility of boulders on the Site may explain the occasional presence of rock, but it appears to me to be highly improbable that rock would be consistently encountered across the Site for these two reasons. As noted above, Mr Wada conceded that he was not able to explain the variations between BH-11, BH-11A and BH-11B, whilst Dr Ting was able to proffer a consistent and coherent theory that satisfactorily explained the results of the Geospecs Logs, Boring Logs and S & F Report.
140    Fifthly, I find that Geospecs’ confirmatory boreholes BH-1A and BH-11A were drilled during a weekend and Resource Piling was not informed so that it could not send representatives to witness the drilling. Mr Tan explained that Mr Okkar had communicated the time of drilling to Mr Babu but the latter had failed to inform Resource Piling.
[note: 111]
 However, I note that Mr Babu was not called as a witness to establish this fact. I find this excuse quite suspicious and self-serving. Geospecs knew there was a claim by Resource Piling that they had encountered rock over large areas in the site. That was the very reason why the confirmatory boreholes were being done in the first place. Mr Tan also claimed that Mr Sinnadurai witnessed the drilling of the two confirmatory boreholes and checked the termination depth.
[note: 112]
 However he too was not called nor did a Professional Engineer sign off on the findings of Geospecs’ confirmatory borelogs as no report was produced and Mr Tan claimed that Mr Sinnadurai’s certification was therefore not required.
[note: 113]
 I have already commented on the lack of sample recovery in the lowest levels of BH-1A (24.00m-27.02m) and BH-11A (24.00m-27.02m) which inevitably led to the lower layers being described as “inferred”. I additionally note that the description of these lowest layers from each borehole did not really correspond to the two layers above for each borehole. I find that no competent engineer could say that these two borelogs confirmed the findings in BH-1 and BH-11. On the other hand, as noted above, the Resident Engineer countersigned on Resource Piling’s Boring Logs and I accept that Resource Piling recovered samples from their boring which were kept by the Resident Engineer for inspection by the Accredited Checker or Developer. Both the Accredited Checker and Developer must have been satisfied and agreed with Resource Piling because the Boring Logs were compiled and sent in together with the As-Built Pile Drawings, duly signed by the Professional Engineer and Accredited Checker, to the BCA. If the Resident Engineer or Longrove had any reservations, I cannot see them signing off these records and drawings for submission and retention by the BCA.
141    In summary, I find that Geospecs’ soil investigation was negligently carried out and the Geospecs Logs were negligently logged and inaccurate, but as I have found that no duty of care exists 
vis-à-vis
 Resource Piling and Geospecs, it is not necessary to consider whether any such hypothetical duty has been breached. If it was necessary to do so, then I would have found that Geospecs was negligent and had breached that duty of care if it existed.
Conclusion
142    For the reasons set out above, I dismiss Resource Piling’s claim on the basis that Geospecs did not owe any duty of care to Resource Piling in relation to the preparation of the Geospecs Logs.
143    I will hear the parties on costs.

ORDER

            
               Appeal allowed with costs.
               Vary so much of the orders of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland by —
                     
(1) setting aside the order ""that the Plaintiff recover against the Defendant the sum of thirty six thousand nine hundred and twenty eight dollars and forty seven cents ($36,928.47) together with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent (10%) per annum for a period of 4½ years"" and substituting in lieu thereof an order that the plaintiff recover against the defendant such sum as is assessed by the Master of the Supreme Court of Queensland in accordance with the evidence, the judgment of this Court and, subject to what is said in that judgment, the findings of Carter J. in the Full Court; and

                     
                     
(2) further ordering that the costs of the assessment of damages before the Master be paid by the defendant.

                     
                     
(3) and omitting the words and figure: ""which costs for the hearing shall be limited to seven (7) days"".

The following written judgments were delivered:—

               
The Court delivered the following addendum to the judgments:—



               May 29
               Brennan and Dawson JJ.
               
We are in agreement with the judgment of Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. and with the order that they propose, subject to some brief observations. The judgment of the majority in the Full Court seems to us to overlook the difference between the fact that the plaintiff had not been working for some time before the trial and an evaluation of the plaintiff's earning capacity which was destroyed in consequence of the defendant's negligence. The fact that the plaintiff did not work is a matter of history, and facts of that kind are ascertained for the purposes of civil litigation on the balance of probabilities: if the court attains the required degree of satisfaction as to the occurrence of an historical fact, that fact is accepted as having occurred. By contrast, earning capacity can be assessed only upon the hypothesis that the plaintiff had not been tortiously injured: what would he have been able to earn if he had not been tortiously injured? To answer that question, the court must speculate to some extent. As the hypothesis is false — for the plaintiff has been injured — the ascertainment of earning capacity involves an evaluation of possibilities, not establishing a fact as a matter of history. Hypothetical situations of the past are analogous to future possibilities: in one case the court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the hypothetical situation would have occurred, in the other the court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the possibility will occur. Both are to be distinguished from events which are alleged to have actually occurred in the past. Lord Diplock said in Mallett v. McMonagle
                  
    [1]
  :The role of the court in making an assessment of damages which depends upon its view as to what will be and what would have been is to be contrasted with its ordinary function in civil actions of determining what was. In determining what did happen in the past a court decides on the balance of probabilities. Anything that is more probable than not it treats as certain. But in assessing damages which depend upon its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing will or would have happened and reflect those chances, whether they are more or less than even, in the amount of damages which it awards.In assessing the plaintiff's earning capacity in the present case, what had to be evaluated was the prospect that the deteriorating back condition would have precluded him from engaging in gainful employment had he not contracted brucellosis. An evaluation of that prospect had to be made. To make a finding on the balance of probabilities as though the prospect were something that had occurred in the past was to misconceive the process of evaluation.



                         [1970] A.C. 166, at p. 176.


               
Although we agree with the general thrust of the reasoning on this point in the judgment of Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ., we think it undesirable for damages to be assessed on the footing of an evaluation expressed as a percentage. Damages need not be assessed by first determining an award on the footing that the hypothetical situation would have occurred and then discounting the award by a selected percentage. Damages founded on hypothetical evaluations defy precise calculation. We should add that we would not favour the use of the term ""probability"" to describe the possibility of occurrence of a situation when the possibility is minimal.
               
Subject to these observations, we agree in the order as formulated in their Honours' reasons for judgment.
            


               
Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.
               
The issue in this appeal concerns the valuation of a plaintiff's damage, caused by the tortious conduct of the defendant, after it is found that it is more likely than not that the damage would have occurred in any event as the result of conditions or events for which the defendant is not legally responsible.
               
The appeal is brought by the plaintiff in an action for damages against his employer. The plaintiff contends that the sum of $36,928.47, substituted by the majority of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland (Matthews and Ambrose JJ.) for the sum of $19,468.54 awarded by the trial judge, is inadequate. Carter J., the dissentient, would have assessed part of the plaintiff's damage at $148,277.63 and ordered an inquiry to assess the rest of his damage.
               
                  
The Plaintiff's Condition
                  
Between October 1972 and April 1980, the defendant employed the plaintiff as a labourer in a meatworks. In July 1977 the plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from brucellosis, a disease acquired from animals. One possible sequela of brucellosis is the development of depressive illness. Another possible sequela of brucellosis is the development of an organic condition which results in a degenerative-like condition in the spine.
                  
The trial judge found that sometime between 1975 and 1977, as the result of the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff had contracted acute brucellosis, but that by June 1983 that condition was no longer present. His Honour also found that, since at least 1982, the plaintiff had suffered from symptoms in his cervical and lumbar spine, but he was not satisfied that the plaintiff's spinal condition was a consequence of contracting brucellosis. He was satisfied, however, that a neurotic illness which was diagnosed in 1979 ""was precipitated by brucellosis"". Nevertheless, he found that it was at least as probable as not that the neurotic condition from which the plaintiff suffered at the time of the trial (September 1987) was not related to the brucellosis which he had contracted in the period 1975-1977. However, this finding was reversed by all members of the Full Court. They held that the plaintiff's damages should be assessed on the basis that his neurotic condition at the time of the trial was caused by depression induced by acute brucellosis. But Matthews and Ambrose JJ. went on to conclude that, by reason of the plaintiff's personality, it was ""likely that the development of symptoms from his deteriorating back condition would have produced a similar neurotic condition even if he had never contracted the brucellosis"". Their Honours said:[I]t is likely that, quite apart from his suffering from brucellosis, by age forty-four he would have become unemployable as a result of his back condition and indeed would have developed as a result a neurotic condition of the sort from which he presently suffers.At the date of the trial, the plaintiff was forty-nine years old. Consequently, Matthews and Ambrose JJ. awarded the plaintiff damages for economic loss only until May 1982. Their Honours awarded $15,000 damages for pain and suffering but, somewhat surprisingly in view of their approach to economic loss, they apportioned ""that sum as to $12,000.00 pre-trial and $3,000.00 post-trial"". They refused to award damages for the care and attention given to the plaintiff by his wife. Their Honours said:He regarded himself as unemployable as the result of this back condition by mid-1982. By that time whatever care and attention was necessary or given to him by his wife was quite unrelated in our opinion to the onset of brucellosis or its attendant neurosis which gave him a cause of action against the respondent and we are of the view that to expound damages on the basis of Griffiths v. Kerkemeyer
    [2]
   is quite unjustified.
                  

                  
In his dissenting judgment, Carter J. held that the plaintiff's damages should be assessed on the basis that, as a result of contracting brucellosis, he suffered a neurotic decompensation which would continue and which had rendered, and would continue to render, him unemployable. His Honour said that in making such an assessment it would be necessary to take account of two discounting factors: first, that some of the plaintiff's present symptoms were referable to the condition of the lumbar and cervical regions of his spine which was unrelated to brucellosis and, secondly, that by reason of his personality the plaintiff was vulnerable and predisposed to the onset of psychiatric disability as a result of the occurrence of some other event, whether at work or elsewhere. On the authority of Griffiths v. Kerkemeyer, his Honour would also have awarded the plaintiff $70,000 for the care and attention given to him by his wife.
                  
In our opinion the majority of the Full Court erred in holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for economic loss after May 1982. Furthermore, we think that their Honours fell into error in their assessment of the damages for pain and suffering and in refusing to award the plaintiff damages for the care and attention given to him by his wife.
               
               
                  
Assessing Damages for Future or Potential Events
                  
When liability has been established and a common law court has to assess damages, its approach to events that allegedly would have occurred, but cannot now occur, or that allegedly might occur, is different from its approach to events which allegedly have occurred. A common law court determines on the balance of probabilities whether an event has occurred. If the probability of the event having occurred is greater than it not having occurred, the occurrence of the event is treated as certain; if the probability of it having occurred is less than it not having occurred, it is treated as not having occurred. Hence, in respect of events which have or have not occurred, damages are assessed on an all or nothing approach. But in the case of an event which it is alleged would or would not have occurred, or might or might not yet occur, the approach of the court is different. The future may be predicted and the hypothetical may be conjectured. But questions as to the future or hypothetical effect of physical injury or degeneration are not commonly susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof. If the law is to take account of future or hypothetical events in assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring. The probability may be very high — 99.9 per cent — or very low — 0.1 per cent. But unless the chance is so low as to be regarded as speculative — say less than 1 per cent — or so high as to be practically certain — say over 99 per cent — the court will take that chance into account in assessing the damages. Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of occurring, but to ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of occurring. Thus, the court assesses the degree of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability. The adjustment may increase or decrease the amount of damages otherwise to be awarded. See Mallett v. McMonagle
                     
    [3]
  ; Davies v. Taylor
                     
    [4]
  ; McIntosh v. Williams
                     
    [5]
  . The approach is the same whether it is alleged that the event would have occurred before or might occur after the assessment of damages takes place.

The Assessment of Damages in the Present Case
                  
In the present case, the majority of the Full Court fell into error in concluding that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for economic loss sustained after May 1982. The plaintiff proved that, at the date of the trial, as the result of the defendant's negligence, he suffered from a psychiatric condition which rendered him unemployable. On the evidence there was little, if any, chance that he would either recover or ever be employable. Subject to an allowance for the ordinary vicissitudes of life, the plaintiff was prima facie entitled to be compensated for the near certainty that, as the result of the defendant's negligence, he will suffer from his psychiatric condition and be unemployable for the rest of his life. However, the majority in the Full Court found that it was ""likely"" that, independently of the defendant's negligence, by May 1982 the plaintiff would have been unemployable and suffering from a similar neurotic condition. By the term ""likely"", their Honours no doubt meant that there was more than a 50 per cent chance that this would have occurred. On that hypothesis, the damages otherwise recoverable by the plaintiff would have to be reduced to provide for that chance. On the evidence, it is impossible to conclude that it is 100 per cent certain that the plaintiff's back condition would have rendered him unemployable if he had not contracted brucellosis. So, on the majority's finding, the reduction in his damages for loss of earning capacity would be somewhere between 51 per cent and 99 per cent. But whatever the precise chance of the plaintiff's back condition totally or partially reducing his earning capacity, the majority in the Full Court erred in refusing to award him any damages for economic loss suffered after May 1982.
                  
Matthews and Ambrose JJ. also found that it was more likely than not that, as the result of the plaintiff's back condition and consequent unemployability, he would have developed a similar neurotic condition. As a result, they refused to award any damages for the care and attention which his wife gave to him and, although the basis of their award for pain and suffering is not clear, they obviously took the view that all effects of the defendant's negligence would be spent shortly after the date of trial. It is impossible to conclude, however, that it was 100 per cent certain that the plaintiff's back condition and consequent unemployability would have precipitated a similar neurotic condition. On the evidence and the findings of the majority of the Full Court, the chance that a similar neurotic condition would actually have resulted from these two events occurring may well be thought to have been far from overwhelming. True it is that the plaintiff developed a neurotic condition as the result of contracting brucellosis. But that disease resulted in suffering which was prolonged and severe. It by no means follows from what occurred as the result of his contracting brucellosis that there is an overwhelming likelihood that another event or other events would have precipitated a similar neurotic condition. First, there was a substantial chance that, even if the plaintiff's back had made him unemployable, he would have gone through life without suffering from a neurotic condition similar to his present condition. Secondly, in determining the chance that unemployability as the result of his back condition would have precipitated a similar neurotic condition, it is necessary to bear in mind that more than one probability is involved. There is the degree of probability that the plaintiff would have become unemployable in any event as the result of his back condition and there is the degree of probability that the happening of that occurrence would have precipitated a neurotic condition. When those probabilities are combined, the chance that the plaintiff would develop a neurotic condition decreases exponentially. If, for example, and only by way of illustration, there was a 75 per cent probability of his becoming unemployable by reason of his back condition even if he had not contracted brucellosis and a 75 per cent chance that that unemployability would have caused a similar neurotic condition, there was only a 56.25 per cent chance (75 per cent x 75 per cent) that, if he had not contracted brucellosis, he would have developed a similar neurotic condition.
                  
Whatever the precise chance that the plaintiff would have developed a similar neurotic condition, the majority in the Full Court erred in refusing to award him any damages for the care and attention given to him by his wife and for the neurotic condition from which he presently suffers. The plaintiff is entitled to damages for pain and suffering on the basis that his neurotic condition is the direct result of the defendant's negligence. Those damages must be reduced, however, to take account of the chance that factors, unconnected with the defendant's negligence, might have brought about the onset of a similar neurotic condition. Likewise, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the care and attention provided by his wife. Again that award must be reduced to take account of the chance that factors, unconnected with the defendant's negligence, would have necessitated similar care and attention.
                  
The appeal must be allowed. The plaintiff submitted that the matter should be referred to the Master to assess the damages in accordance with the findings of Carter J. Subject to one qualification, we consider that that is the appropriate course in the circumstances. Indeed, we did not understand counsel for the respondent (defendant) to contest that course of action in the event that the approach of the majority of the Full Court was held to be erroneous. The qualification arises from the fact that Carter J. did not expressly find, as did the majority of the Full Court, that it was probable, in the sense of more likely than not, that the plaintiff would in any event have developed a back condition which would have rendered him unemployable from 1982. Nor did Carter J. expressly find that it was also probable that the combination of such unemployability and such a back condition would have given rise to a similar neurotic condition. The views of the majority of the Full Court on those matters were open to their Honours on the evidence and should be accepted by the Master as providing guidance about the chances of what would or would not have occurred if the plaintiff had not contracted brucellosis.
               
               
                  
Order
                  
The appeal is allowed. The judgment entered for the appellant (plaintiff) in the sum of $36,928.47 is set aside. In lieu thereof, judgment is entered for the appellant in such sum as is assessed by the Master of the Supreme Court of Queensland in accordance with the evidence, the findings of Carter J. in the Full Court and the judgment of this Court. The appellant's costs of the trial (limited to seven days), his costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to the Full Court, his costs of the appeal to this Court and his costs of the assessment of damages before the Master are to be paid by the respondent.

               Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.
               
The trial judge ordered that the plaintiff recover his costs of the action limited to seven days. His Honour was of the view that, having regard to the findings which he made and the limitation which those findings placed on the plaintiff's damages, he should in the exercise of his discretion restrict the costs which the plaintiff should recover. On appeal to this Court it was held that the plaintiff's recoverable losses were not limited in the manner in which his Honour had found. The basis for the restriction on the order for costs was thus removed. Consequently, the order for costs should be reformed to reflect the reasons for judgment of this Court.
               
The limitation contained in the order of the trial judge should be deleted. The order of this Court should be amended accordingly.",1990-06-26 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

5167,2703527,R v Duffy (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 493,"Judgment


	
	The Crown applies under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to cross-examine the witness and co-offender Rachael Evans on the basis that evidence that she has given in-chief is unfavourable evidence. There are seven discrete areas in respect of which cross-examination is sought.
	
	
	The first area relates to the issue of the belt used to kill the deceased. The evidence from Ms Evans was that the belt was on the end of the bed at the time she went into the bedroom with the witness XY intending at that stage to ""smash"" Colleen. She said that when she was in that bedroom at an earlier time that evening talking to Colleen the belt was not there. Her evidence that the belt was in the room when she entered it with the witness XY conflicts with the evidence that was given by the witness XY who said that when they were sitting in the lounge room of the guesthouse Rachael Evans went elsewhere and came back with the belt. XY said that Ms Evans sat with the belt in the living room playing with it and muttering to herself. It was that belt, according to the witness XY, that was taken into the bedroom by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The other evidence said to be inconsistent with Rachael Evans' evidence is the evidence of Mrs Green who said that there was no belt in the bedroom of the guesthouse when she and her husband left to go on holidays. The significance of that evidence for the present application is considerably weakened, however, by the fact that Rachael Evans herself says that the belt was not there earlier in the evening of the killing.
	
	
	The second area relates to the injury that Rachael Evans says was caused to the deceased's head by XY hitting her on the forehead with a bottle. She says that when that happened the deceased’s forehead was split in a way that caused it to bleed. That evidence is inconsistent with the evidence given by the witness XY who said that she was not even in the room at the time, let alone did not hit the deceased with the bottle. It is also, more significantly, inconsistent with the evidence of the forensic pathologist who said that there was nothing on the forehead of the deceased's body which would indicate that there was a laceration or an injury of the type described by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The third area of evidence relates to who collected the sheets from the bedroom where the deceased was killed. The evidence of Rachael Evans was that the witness XY collected the sheets some little time after the killing when at least Rachael Evans had taken the deceased's body to the shower and was washing it. That evidence is to be contrasted with the evidence of the witness XY who said that after she was effectively told to get out of the bedroom after the killing, she went and stood on the balcony and soon after the sheets were thrown over the balcony past her from the bedroom by Rachael Evans.
	
	
	The fourth area concerns the conversation Mr Derbridge reported at the park at Campbelltown which is recorded at page 261 of the transcript. This was his evidence that had initially been provided in his final ERISP where he said that at the park Rachael Evans had said she wanted to kill Colleen, that the witness XY had said something similar and when Mr Derbridge was asked about Mr Duffy, he said, ""He was in on it too"" and said, ""He [ie Duffy] went, 'Yeah, we will, we will and, yeah, they killed her'"". The evidence given by Rachael Evans in-chief was that there was no conversation at the park about wanting to kill Colleen.
	
	
	The fifth area concerns evidence given by Mr Derbridge (at T 204) that he and the witness XY were lying down in the second bedroom in the guesthouse when Rachael Evans came into the room and said they were going to kill her now. Rachael Evans gives no such evidence and denies having said anything of the sort. I will return to the detail of what was said presently.
	
	
	The evidence from the witness XY was unclear about whether she was ever in that bedroom, although she seemed to accept, on balance, that it is possible that she was in that bedroom at some stage lying down. However, she did not give evidence consistent with Mr Derbridge's evidence in that regard.
	
	
	The sixth area which the Crown seeks simply to ask Ms Evans, rather than to put it as a positive proposition to her, is that shortly before she went into the bedroom when the deceased was killed, she was sitting in the lounge saying, ""I'm going to do it, I'm not going to do it"" and was debating with herself in a low voice. That was the evidence of the witness XY.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown wishes to cross-examine Ms Evans concerning her motive for having killed the deceased. Her evidence-in-chief was that she did not know why she had killed her. The Crown wishes to put to her that a motive for the killing was jealousy arising from Ms Evans’ past relationship with Mr Duffy. There was evidence that the deceased was interested in Mr Duffy and they had had sex during the course of that evening.
	
	
	The application is opposed by Mr Trevallion of counsel for the accused. He says that the evidence affects only the credibility of the witness and does not amount to unfavourable evidence within the meaning of s 38 of the Act for that reason alone. He particularly opposes cross-examination relating to the fifth area concerning Mr Derbridge’s evidence of what Ms Evans said before the killing.
	
	
	Earlier in the trial an application was made by the Crown under s 38 to cross-examine the witness XY. In my reasons for judgment in permitting that cross-examination, I drew attention to a passage in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Le (2001) NSWSC 174 at [15] and a passage in the judgment of R v SH [2011] ACTSC 198; (2011) 6 ACTLR 1 at [35] by Refshauge J. In that judgment I considered that those statements of principle justified the leave to the Crown to cross-examine that witness.
	
	
	It seems to me that there is nothing different in principle from what is being sought in the present case. This is one of a number of Crown witnesses who were present at or about the time of the killing. The evidence of this witness is not on all-fours with the other two significant witnesses, that is, the witness XY and the witness Scott Derbridge. Further, the evidence of the witness Rachael Evans in relation to the injury said to have been caused by being struck by the witness XY is inconsistent with the expert opinion of the forensic pathologist. Nevertheless, the Crown was obliged to lead this evidence as part of its responsibility in properly prosecuting the case.
	
	
	In that sense it seems to me that the evidence in the seven categories that have been identified is unfavourable evidence within the meaning of s 38. No particular prejudice or disadvantage has been pointed to by the accused if the Crown was permitted to cross-examine this witness under s 38 except in relation to the fifth matter. To understand the prejudice alleged it is necessary to set out what appears in the transcript at that point of Mr Derbridge’s evidence.
	
	
	The transcript originally read:
	


Q. What happened then?

A. Rachael ‑ after me and Monique went to sleep Rachael came in, woke us up, saying that, ""They're going to kill Colleen now"".

Subsequently counsel agreed that the evidence of Mr Derbridge involved the use of indirect speech and that the transcript should read:

A. Rachael ‑ after me and Monique went to sleep Rachael came in, woke us up, saying that they're going to kill Colleen now.


	
	Significantly, no objection was taken by Counsel for the Accused to the evidence being given in that form, that is, by the use of indirect speech. Nor was Mr Derbridge cross-examined in attempt to show that what was said by Ms Evans was “We’re going to kill Colleen now”. However, Mr Trevallion, in opposing the s 38 application in relation to this evidence, submitted that it was never made clear by Mr Derbridge whether he was suggesting that Ms Evans was saying “We’re” meaning Ms Evans and perhaps some other person unnamed, or “They’re” which would necessarily exclude her but likely include the accused. If the latter was meant the statement was hearsay and should not be allowed.
	
	
	The use of the term “We’re” was significantly different because it was Ms Evans’ evidence that it was XY who wanted to “smash” the deceased and had asked for Ms Evans’ assistance in that regard. If prejudice arose to Mr Duffy by questions asked about this matter it arose when Mr Derbridge gave his evidence and no objection was taken to it. However, when I sought clarification from the Crown about what precise question she intended to put to Ms Evans concerning Mr Derbridge’s evidence, she said that she intended to put that Ms Evans came into the room and said “We’re going to kill Colleen now”. She was not going to put that Ms Evans said “They’re going to kill Colleen now”.
	
	
	In those circumstances, not only would cross-examination about that matter not be prejudicial to Mr Duffy but the question to be put would clarify Mr Derbridge’s ambiguous evidence in favour of the accused. There is, therefore, no forensic disadvantage nor unfair prejudice to the accused by granting leave under s 38 on this part of the evidence.
	
	
	Otherwise, I regard the evidence in the other areas as unfavourable evidence. For those reasons, leave is granted.

5318,2704349,Dries v R [2014] NSWCCA 228,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Rothman J.
2ROTHMAN J: Shannon Dries, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon him following a plea of guilty. The effective sentence imposed was a non-parole period of three years' imprisonment, commencing 31 July 2012 and concluding 30 July 2015, with the remainder of term being a period of three years and six months expiring 30 January 2019. 
3A plea of guilty was entered on 26 April 2013 at the Local Court and confirmed before the District Court at all stages. 
4The applicant was sentenced, in the District Court, following his plea, for the following offences: 
Sequence 6: Supply prohibited drug, 122 grams cannabis leaf, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (for which the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000 and for which there is no prescribed standard non-parole period);
Sequence 7: Supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 477.9 grams of methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985;
Sequence 8: Supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 192.3 grams of 3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (ecstasy) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
[Sequences 7 and 8 above each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and/or $385,000 fine and have a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment].
5Further to the above, the applicant was sentenced, in relation to Sequence 7, bearing in mind two charges notified on a Form 1, which were:
(1)Two counts of supply prohibited drug, cannabis leaf, pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which a maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment and/or $220,000 fine;
(2)Three counts of unlawfully obtained goods on premises, motor vehicle parts, pursuant to s 527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which is prescribed a maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment and/or a $1,100 fine. 
6The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence, which is set out below, together with the indicative sentences:  
Sequence 6: Conviction, but, pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the imposition of no other penalty;
Sequence 7 (Indicative Sentence): Taking account of the Form 1 offences, imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and six months with a remainder of term of a further two years and nine months;
Sequence 8 (Indicative Sentence): Imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and six months with a remainder of term of a further two years and six months. 
Pursuant to the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, an aggregate sentence was imposed of a non-parole period of three years' imprisonment, commencing 31 July 2012 and expiring 30 July 2015 with a remainder of term of a further three years and six months expiring 30 January 2019. 
7The applicant raises one ground of appeal, which, as filed, was in the following terms:
(1)His Honour was led into error by a statement of facts which erroneously recorded the purity level of a prohibited drug, causing the sentencing judge to take into consideration the purported very high purity level of the drug in imposing sentence, where that purity level was in fact unknown. 
8During the hearing, on questioning from the Court, the applicant sought, and was granted leave, to amend the ground to the following: 
(1)The sentence proceedings miscarried by reason of an error in the statement of agreed facts which erroneously recorded the purity level of a prohibited drug, causing the sentencing judge to take into consideration the purported very high purity level of the drug in imposing sentence, where that purity level was in fact unknown. 
Facts
9On 22 April 2012, the applicant engaged in a telephone conversation with an unknown person and agreed to supply that person with an amount of cannabis. This is one of the offences notified on the Form 1. On 2 May 2012, the applicant engaged in a further telephone conversation with another person, a male, and agreed to sell and supply cannabis (the second supply offence notified on the Form 1). 
10On 28 May 2012, the applicant engaged in a further telephone conversation with a male that was intercepted by police. The applicant was subsequently stopped by police while driving to a townhouse in Penrith, where the other person involved in the telephone conversation resided. Police found 122 grams of cannabis leaf in four bags in the applicant's car. This is the charge preferred, and described above, as Sequence 6. 
11On 24 July 2012, police executed a search warrant at the home of the applicant and found a box containing four clear plastic bags in his bedroom. Subsequent analysis found two of the bags contained a combined total of 477 grams of methylamphetamine (Sequence 7) and the other two bags contained a combined total of 192.3 grams of ecstasy (Sequence 8).
12In the course of the sentencing proceedings a statement of Agreed Facts, which the Crown tendered set out the purity of the prohibited drug found in each bag. Both bags containing methylamphetamine were said to have a purity of 14%. The bag containing 129.3 grams of ecstasy was said to have a purity of 17% and the smaller bag containing 63 grams of ecstasy was, in the Agreed Facts, stated to have a purity of 63%. No Analyst Certificate was tendered to the Court. 
13The Analysts' Certificates were provided to the applicant as part of the police brief of evidence, but were not tendered. The Analysts' Certificates demonstrate the correctness of the Agreed Facts in relation to the purity of each of the bags containing methylamphetamine and the larger bag containing 129.3 grams of ecstasy. However, the Analysts' Certificates show the purity of the smaller bag of 63 grams of ecstasy was not tested. 
14It seems that in compiling the Agreed Facts, the weight of ecstasy in the smaller bag was repeated, mistakenly, as the purity of the ecstasy in that bag. None of the Analysts' Certificates was before his Honour, as already stated, and his Honour was unaware of any issue as to purity other than that stated in the Agreed Facts. 
Remarks on Sentence
Objective Circumstances
15I do not repeat all that was the subject of comment by his Honour in describing the objective circumstances. The facts giving rise to the offences have already been set out and were repeated by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence. His Honour referred (ROS, 6) to the purity of the ecstasy, but it was in the context of a passage that referred to there being little or no indicia of actual supply. His Honour said:
""During the course of his evidence, the Offender said he had it [the methylamphetamine] for his own use and to give to nine or ten mates without profit. He may well have had the funds to make the purchase of these drugs via the combination of his payout and the sale of his dogs that he bred and trained. His own usage, however, would mean that these drugs would have lasted him a long time. Apart from what is referred to as a debt ledger, there is no indicia of supply. The facts, which the Offender signed, referred to this debt ledger as being consistent with a tick list recording supplies of prohibited drug. His signing of the facts is no more than an acknowledgment that it is consistent with that and does not amount to an acceptance or admission on his part that that is what it was. During evidence, he said it was a reflection of people paying him for the dogs that they had bought from him after he bred and trained them.""
16Generally, his Honour came to the view, to the advantage of the applicant, that the applicant was using the supply to his nine or ten mates as a means of covering the outlay for his own use, which the Court remarked ""explains but does not excuse his offending behaviour"" (ROS, 7). 
17The sentencing judge came to the conclusion that, while the acts of supply to his mates must have been intended to be on a very regular basis, it was ""not in the higher echelons of the drug trafficking hierarchy"" and accepted that the applicant ""was trafficking drugs to a relatively small group of individuals whom he knew were users for the purposes of funding his own habit"" (ROS, 7). 
18Understandably, even though the sentencing judge made reference to the purity of the drugs, the reference was very much a passing reference and, the entirety of the Remarks on Sentence (at least in relation to objective circumstances) referred to the usual factors to conclude that the objective circumstances of the offences were ""below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not at the bottom of the range, indeed far from it"".  
Subjective Circumstances 
19His Honour allowed a discount for the plea of guilty of 25%, the plea having been entered at the earliest opportunity. His Honour took account of the applicant's relatively young age although, correctly, remarked that 24 years of age, the age of the applicant at the time the offences were committed, was at the ""very upper echelons of what might be regarded as young"", and, notwithstanding that comment, gave slight weight to deterrence and greater weight to rehabilitation (ROS, 8). Consideration was also given to the applicant's substance abuse issues and mental health issues. However, due to their lack of causal connection, his Honour did not give less weight to deterrence because of these issues (ROS, 8). 
20His early years, noted by the sentencing judge, were affected by his mother's mental health issue. The applicant was the middle of three children, but also lived with four younger foster children. The applicant was diagnosed with ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder and prescribed medication as a child for those conditions. Schooling was intermittent and employment was casual and irregular.
21The applicant has a son, born in 2008, and the applicant separated from his child's mother, and was separated at the time of his arrest. An allowance was made, as a subjective factor favouring the applicant, that he was responsible for the care of his son for three or four days per week and would have full time custody of the child when released (ROS, 3). 
22The applicant was given the benefit of the fact that he was a victim of a glassing when he was 21 and lost some sight in one eye. He was also given the benefit of medical conditions discovered, at or just prior to, his incarceration. The applicant has a substance abuse problem that commenced when he was about 12 years of age. 
23The sentencing judge also gave the applicant the benefit of an assessment that he suffered PTSD and high levels of anxiety and stress, which had been described by experts as extremely severe, while his level of depression was described as moderate. 
24The sentencing judge found, due to the requirement that the applicant be in protective custody (ROS, 4) and his physical and mental health issues, that the applicant's time in custody would be more burdensome (ROS, 4). 
25The sentencing judge also found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were very good and the likelihood of reoffending very low, particularly if the applicant addressed his substance abuse problems and treated his mental health issues (ROS, 7). 
26Lastly, the sentencing judge gave the applicant the benefit of leniency, extended to first offenders as a consequence of a criminal history that consisted only of traffic offences (ROS, 5) and found that the applicant was remorseful (ROS, 2). 
Consideration
27The applicant concedes that the Analysts' Certificates were not tendered at sentence. His Honour relied upon the Agreed Facts, which was the evidence before him. In so doing, his Honour committed no error. 
28Rather, the agreement between the parties as to the relevant facts occasioned, it is said, a miscarriage in the sentencing proceedings. 
29In effect, the applicant submits that this Court should go behind the evidence adduced in the proceeding, because the evidence may have led his Honour into error, or, as last framed, led to a miscarriage. 
30Significantly, the applicant does not argue that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive (or excessive, at all). 
31The Crown concedes that the Agreed Facts upon which his Honour relied were, to the extent that it specified a purity of 63% for the smallest bag of ecstasy, not based on any source evidence and ought not to have been put to his Honour. 
32His Honour came to the view that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness (ROS, 7), but not at the bottom of the range. It is not suggested that such an assessment was wrong, manifestly or otherwise. Nor is it suggested that, were the purity of the smallest bag of drugs stated as ""unknown"" in the Agreed Facts (as should have been the case), the assessment would have been different. 
33While the sentencing judge referred to the purity of the drugs in the smallest container on three separate occasions in the course of his Remarks, at no stage did he expressly link the purity of the smallest of the quantity with the assessment of criminality. As earlier stated, the sentencing judge expressly accepted, albeit with some reluctance, that the drug supply was to persons whom he knew and who, he knew, were drug users and effected by the applicant for the purpose of funding his own drug abuse. 
34It is not absolutely clear, from the submissions of the applicant, that which is said to be the error into which his Honour was led (as originally agitated) or what the miscarriage was. Sentencing is an intuitive synthesis which in part seeks to reconcile sometimes conflicting goals. This Court will intervene in a sentence only where one of the specified and narrow bases for intervention has been established. 
35It is not an error for the sentencing judge to rely on the only evidence before him. When the High Court remarked that an appeal court will intervene in the sentence only on grounds, which include that the sentencing judge ""mistakes the facts"", it was referring to the facts that have been adduced in evidence before the Court: see House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. 
36In truth, the ground of appeal is that the sentence proceedings miscarried. Both the Crown and the applicant's counsel had the Analysts' Certificates, which formed the basis for the Agreed Facts. 
37As is conceded by the applicant in his submissions to this Court, the sentencing judge did not differentiate, in terms of the assessment of objective seriousness, between the offence described in Sequence 7 and the offence described in Sequence 8. Yet the error in relation to purity affected only the circumstances of Sequence 8 and only a minority of the drugs subject to Sequence 8. 
38There is no necessary nexus between the purity of a drug and the offences under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. There exists no legislative requirement to connect purity with the applicable statutory maximum penalties. Nevertheless, purity is a factor considered when determining whether an offence falls into the mid-range of seriousness: R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; (2005) 152 A Crim R 462 at [56]. 
39The indicative sentence for Sequence 7, as has been stated, takes account of Form 1 offences. Each of those offences involves supply of small amounts of cannabis or possession of stolen goods. No one submits that any of those offences would have had an effect (or substantial effect) on the sentence, particular in light of the judge's attitude to Sequence 6. 
40Where, as here, the sentencing judge does not differentiate between the objective seriousness of two different offences, coupled with the absence of a legislative requirement connecting purity with the maximum penalty imposed for particular offences, it becomes difficult to maintain a proposition that an error of fact applicable to only one part of one of them has affected, or significantly affected, the assessment of objective seriousness of that offence. 
41In this instance, the maximum sentences for each of the offences for which a custodial sentence was imposed was 20 years' imprisonment. Yet, the sentencing judge imposed an indicative sentence of a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for each, and a further 2 years and 9 months or 2 years and 6 months respectively. 
42An aggregate sentence of 3 years non-parole period with a further 3 years and 6 months as the remainder of sentence, compared to a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment for each offence is hardly reflective of a proposition that the sentencing judge has imposed a sentence that is too high (or higher than it should or could be) because of a misrepresentation to him by counsel of the purity of the smallest amount of drugs in one of four bags. On the contrary, if the sentencing judge has taken into account, to any significant degree, the level of purity of the 63 gram bag of ecstasy, the sentence is extraordinarily light. 
43No error was committed by his Honour. His Honour sentenced on the basis of the evidence before him. If error were to have occurred in the process, it is error by counsel that has led to a miscarriage or an irregularity in the proceedings. Unless the error renders the sentencing process or the result irregular, the foregoing kind of error can only give rise to interference by this Court if it can be shown that the error had an effect, or substantial effect, on the sentence imposed and the sentence is, on that account, inappropriate. 
44The objective seriousness of the offence described in Sequence 8 could not have been different from that assessed by the sentencing judge, even adjusting any possible assessment for the correct (or unknown) purity of the small ecstasy bag. The applicant has failed to establish any difference, or likely difference, in the assessment of objective seriousness, nor in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. 
45Further, any arguable error would impact on only one of the two indicative sentences and no submission has been made as to how that would have impacted on the aggregate sentence imposed. Indeed, counsel for the applicant conceded that, if error were to be found, this would not affect the non-parole period set by his Honour, but only possibly the remainder of term. 
46The objective error in the facts admitted into evidence before the sentencing judge has not been shown to have given rise to any substantial effect and has not been shown to have resulted in a sentence that is, on the true facts, inappropriate, or unwarranted. 
47Even if it were otherwise, the applicant has, in my view, failed to satisfy the threshold in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that a less severe sentence is warranted. 
48In my view, the appeal must fail and I propose that the Court make orders granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal. 
49RA HULME J: I agree with Rothman J.

12837,2768913,R v Jordan [2016] NSWDC 164,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: It is undeniable that a strong predictor of whether a particular person will commit crimes is whether that person’s parents had a history of offending. One might have hoped that a child seeing parents waste large parts of their lives in custody, parents who live out their lives measured in court dates, release dates, head sentences and non-parole periods, might mean that children of such parents do all they can to avoid following in the footsteps of those parents, but matters, of course, are not as easy at that. The upbringing a child has significant impacts on their behaviour, and a child who like Liam Jordan who appears for sentence today, was brought up by parents who demonstrated regular offending, who modelled regular drug use and who failed to set behavioural boundaries will often end up, as Mr Jordan has, before courts facing sentence which necessarily involves them serving sentences of imprisonment just like their parents did.
	
	
	Not all of us have the same background, not all of us have the same opportunities in life and so in deciding the moral culpability of any particular offender it is important to understand the nature of that offender’s background.
	
	
	When we talk about moral culpability we often consider questions of personal choice. To what extent has the offender chosen to commit these offences? Some people, people like Mr Jordan, have less ability to choose law abiding lifestyles than those who are brought up by parents who do not commit crimes, who do not use drugs and who do set proper behavioural boundaries.
	
	
	I have started these remarks on sentence that way, because of the link between Mr Jordan’s background and what brings him before me today.
	
	
	Problems started for Mr Jordan even before he was born. His mother was a drug addict and so when born he needed immediate treatment. His parents, he believed, loved him, but really set no effective boundaries apart from requiring that he have good manners. He was brought up by whichever parent happened not to be in custody at any particular time. His father was a drug addict too and served sentences of imprisonment on a regular basis. Eventually his mother abandoned the family and he was left to be brought up by his father.
	
	
	At one stage he was taken into foster care. As I understand the psychologist’s report, tendered on behalf of Mr Jordan today, his foster parents did their best, but Mr Jordan’s behavioural problems were such that when his father got out from custody at one stage they did not stop Mr Jordan from leaving their care and returning to live with his father. He was about 14 years of age at that time, and after he left his foster carers he never returned to any formal schooling. His last education was thus when he was in year 9. But, of course, the inevitable occurred, his father was returned to custody after committing some other offence and Mr Jordan was forced to live on the streets. It is in that context that a lot of the matters on his criminal history must have occurred. He told the psychologist that a lot of that offending was simply a result of needing to steal to survive, to obtain food and the necessities of life.
	
	
	He has a history of drug use, which is not surprising given his background, but has been able to abstain from time to time. It was one particular relapse that led to him committing the offences that I will now describe.
	
	
	Mid-morning on a Saturday in June last year the offender broke into the home of a 46 year old woman. Whilst in the home he found that woman’s handbag, took it and stole it. In her handbag were a mobile phone and several bank keycards. A little while later she noticed her handbag was gone and reported the theft to police. A little while after he had stolen that handbag he was seen going through it in the backyard of another home. When he heard a nearby noise he appeared to be startled and ran away.
	
	
	What I have just described has led to the offender pleading guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to steal, the circumstance of aggravation being he either knew or was deemed known that the premises were occupied. Attached to that offence is the matter on the Form 1, stealing from a dwelling. That relates to the actual handbag that was stolen after Mr Jordan broke into the house intending to steal.
	
	
	Ordinarily one might have expected to see a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely, of stealing. It is puzzling that the charges that the Crown has preferred against Mr Jordan have effectively split-up his offending into aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to steal, with the actual stealing on a Form 1. The explanation appears to be that by doing so the standard non-parole period is avoided. Such creative charge bargaining on behalf of the DPP does it no credit whatsoever. Crown Prosecutors, trial advocates and solicitors from the DPP should not obtain pleas of guilty at the cost of bringing discredit onto the criminal justice system by such creative charge bargaining.
	
	
	There is another matter on the Form 1 too, and that is a matter of entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse, that, of course, relating to the time that the offender spent in someone else’s backyard going through the handbag he had stolen nearby.
	
	
	Shortly after he ran off, as I have described earlier, he broke into other premises. He was observed by a witness to be in the backyard of a house in Glebe, to open a closed window and to climb inside. The eyewitness called police, who arrived while the accused was actually in the premises. He began climbing out the window in full view of police. He was challenged and ran away. Eventually he was caught, but denied any wrongdoing when interviewed by police.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki said that these offences were offences at the low end of the range of offences of that type. I do not agree. They are entirely normal, standard, middle of the range offences of break and enter with intent to steal or aggravated break and enter with intent to steal. Indeed, judges and magistrates see so many offences of this type that we tend to begin to regard them as normal, but that is to ignore the serious consequences of offences of the type I have just described. It is notorious that those who have the security of their homes broken are as a result more fearful, less confident, and, to put matter bluntly, less happy about their lives. What to people like Mr Jordan is a simple entry in a premises and the theft of a handbag is to the victim of such offences a very serious matter. Alarms are installed, bars are put on windows and people become less confident in their lives.
	
	
	There are wider consequences as well, the community in general suffers through higher insurance premiums, all of us putting on extra security in our homes, and it is for these reasons that significant penalties are provided for the offences for which I must sentence Mr Jordan, 14 years for the aggravated form of the offence and ten years for the unaggravated form of the offence.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offender pleaded guilty. He did this at an early stage and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. He has been in custody from the day of his arrest, the day he committed these offences, 27 June 2015. Not all of that pre-sentence custody was referrable to these matters. He did one month for an unrelated matter and so I will date the sentence of imprisonment, which Mr Kozanecki concedes I must impose upon his client, from 27 July 2015.
	
	
	I mentioned Mr Jordan’s prior offending. He does have a lengthy record for one so young, but this is the first significant time he will spend in custody.
	
	
	Not surprisingly perhaps, given his background, the psychologist describes him as being anxious, depressed and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. These are significant factors affecting Mr Jordan. Nevertheless it is appropriate for a significant level of general deterrence to be built into the sentence I will shortly announce.
	
	
	The connection between Mr Jordan’s drug use and his offending is obvious. Indeed, he claims to have no memory of these offences, having consumed ice and then Xanax shortly before he committed the offences. That circumstance is of particular relevance when one looks at his prospects for rehabilitation. They are intricately bound up with the prospects of him ceasing to use drugs in the future. I should emphasise there is nothing to suggest that he has been using drugs since he went into custody. There are no disciplinary matters on his custodial history and no suggestion that he has failed any urine tests that he has been required to undergo. I note also the sentiments he expressed to the psychologist in which he expressed remorse for his conduct and empathy towards the victims of it.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki, I think I have already mentioned, concedes that imprisonment is appropriate and made no suggestion that that imprisonment would be other than fulltime imprisonment. He asked me to make a finding of special circumstances, which I will, based on the need for Mr Jordan to be assisted with his drug problems upon his release from custody. As I mentioned, if he can deal with his issues regarding drugs, the chances of him committing further offences in the future are significantly reduced. So it is thus not only in his interests, but also the community’s interests, that he be given the benefit of an extended period of supervision on parole.
	
	
	Mr Kozanecki submitted that the appropriate sentence to impose upon his client was one which minimised his time in custody as way of minimising his exposure to other more significant criminals, which would simply perpetuate his exposure to poor role models, a situation which has existed for all of Mr Jordan’s relatively short life.
	
	
	There also needs to be an element of personal deterrence. Mr Jordan needs to understand that if he continues to offend he will continue to go to gaol just as his parents did.
	
	
	Of recent times his father has apparently turned the corner. It is now seven years since he served a custodial sentence and has had stable accommodation for five. That is very much to his credit and Mr Jordan is rightfully proud of his father for what he has achieved, but he has only achieved that at a very late stage of his life. Mr Jordan has the opportunity to achieve something similar at a much younger stage of his life. If he does his life will be better for it. I have done what I can to encourage Mr Jordan to make the decision upon his release from custody that he is not going to go back to gaol. I have done what I can to give him support which will assist him in that regard, but ultimately it is up to him. If he commits further offences I will send him to gaol and so will everyone else. If he does not his life will be better for it.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. I would have imposed on the aggravated break and enter with intent to steal a sentence of imprisonment of three years, and on the break and enter with intent to steal a sentence of imprisonment of two years. The aggregate sentence is one of consisting of a non-parole period of two years to date from 27 July 2015 and a head sentence of three half years. The non-parole period will expire on 26 July 2017, on which day Mr Jordan is eligible to be released to parole.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was an appeal by the public prosecutor against the acquittal of the respondent on two charges of knowingly giving false information under s 28(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed). After hearing arguments on both sides, I dismissed the appeal for the reasons I now give.
 2.
 The facts
The undisputed facts were as follows. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had received a written complaint about one Paul Chua who was the President of the Singapore Body Builders Federation (SBBF). Pursuant to this, the respondent and one Jojo Sinclair, both bodybuilders, were called up to give information relating to the alleged commission of corruption offences by Paul Chua. On 12 April 1996, both of them went down to the CPIB and the respondent gave a statement to the senior special investigator of the CPIB. This statement (P4) later became the subject matter of the two charges. After the respondent went home, he realised that he had made a mistake in P4 and contacted Jojo Sinclair. Jojo Sinclair then informed the CPIB on 15 April 1996 that both she and the respondent had made mistakes in their statements. The respondent was called up nearly two weeks later and an interview on 30 April 1996 was arranged. When the respondent returned to the CPIB on 30 April 1996, he was interviewed from 10:30am to 12:20pm and for another hour in the afternoon before statement `C` was recorded at 3:05pm. On 14 January 1997, the respondent was charged with two counts of knowingly giving false information relating to the commission of corruption offences and a statement was recorded from the respondent under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). In answer to the charge of giving false information, the respondent stated `I have nothing to say`.
 3.Certain information in paras 9 and 10 of P4 was highlighted as false in the two charges: 
9 Sometime in June 1993, I won the Pro-M Classics held in Malacca which came with a monetary award of US$5,000. The money was forwarded to the SBBF by the organising committee. When I returned to Singapore, Paul Chua gave me cash of US$4,000 and I accepted it. 
 Paul Chua told me that he had deducted US$1,000 from the monetary awards as he had helped me to win by entertaining the judges in the competition. He did not tell me how he went about entertaining the judges to help me win the title 
. I did not ask him to return me the US$1,000 as I did not want to offend him 
10 About two months later after the Pro-M Classics in 1993, I was supposed to participate in the World Game Championship held at Holland. I was to take part in the middle weight category. The other two competitors who took part in this competition from Singapore was Jojo Sinclair (sic) and Mohd Ismail. Before we departed for Holland, I happened (sic) to see Paul Chua at the federation office together with Jojo Sinclair (sic) to discuss about the programmes and details of the coming World (sic) Game Championship. 
 In the middle of the conversation, Paul Chua asked me whether I wanted to win the World Game Competition. I told him of course I wanted to win and he then told me to give him $3,000. He said that he could help me win the competition by using the $3,000 to entertain the judges in the World Game Championship 
 and also to use part of it to throw a party (in Singapore) for the bodybuilders and their families and also the officials of the federation after the competition
 4.At the trial, the admissibility of statement `C` was objected to and a voir dire was held. At the end of the voir dire, the district judge found that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that statement `C` was made voluntarily. The statement was therefore excluded. The prosecution therefore relied on the evidence of Paul Chua that the allegations were false and that he could not have bribed the judges as they were all men of reputation and integrity. The prosecution also invited the court to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s failure to mention his defence in his s 122(6) statement.
 5.At the close of the prosecution`s case, the respondent was called upon to enter his defence. The respondent`s defence was that the statements were made honestly; he believed the facts to be true when he made them. He only realised that there were some mistakes when he went home and recollected his thoughts. He readily admitted that, in relation to para 9, the Pro-M Classics 1993 was held on 30 August and not in June; the prize was US$4,500 and not US$5,000 and the prize money was given to him in Malacca and not forwarded by the organising committee to the SBBF. He maintained, however, that Paul Chua had obtained US$1,000 out of his prize money to defray the expenses in entertaining the judges.
 6.As regards para 10, the respondent asserted that Paul Chua did not ask him for $3,000 so that he could help him win the World Games Championship in Holland. The alleged purpose of the $3,000 was to throw a party for the bodybuilders, their families and the SBBF officials in Singapore after the World Games competition. The respondent explained that he acceded to Paul Chua`s requests for money because he was afraid that he might be placed under a ban again. He was also afraid that he might be `marked` and not be selected for overseas competitions.
 7.At the end of the trial, the district judge was not satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the respondent had given the information highlighted, knowing it to be false. The information might not be true and the respondent might even be careless or reckless about the information he had given but the district judge was of the view that this fell short of the requisite mental element: knowledge that the information he gave was false. In the circumstances, the respondent was acquitted of both charges.
 8.
 The appeal
The prosecution submitted that the district judge`s findings of fact and the inferences he drew, which formed the basis of the acquittals, were reached against the weight of the evidence. In addition, it was contended that the district judge erred in failing to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s silence in his s 122(6) statement.
 9.First of all, it was submitted that the district judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the respondent`s history of defiance when he accepted the respondent`s evidence that he gave the money out of fear. It was undisputed that the respondent had earlier defied Paul Chua and the then Singapore Amateur Body Building Federation (SABBF) for the period of 1980 to 1988 and had, in 1994, expressed his dissatisfaction in the press with the Sportsman of the Year award and the Coca Cola/
 Sunday Times 
 Sports Star award. Even in 1993, when the two sums of money referred to in the charges were allegedly given, the respondent was often late for training sessions despite Paul Chua`s unhappiness about it.
 10.The prosecution also argued that there was no valid reason for the respondent to fear Paul Chua. There was no evidence to suggest that Paul Chua himself had the ability to impose a ban on the respondent. Neither was there evidence to show that a bodybuilder had been `marked` for being critical of Paul Chua. There was a selection committee on which distinguished members sat and a selection process. It was therefore unlikely that Paul Chua alone could make decisions as to the selection of bodybuilders for overseas competitions. The prosecution argued that the fear of being banned did not operate on the respondent`s mind as he could not even remember being placed on life-ban when he was initially questioned on it. For this reason, the prosecution contended that the respondent could not have been so fearful of Paul Chua that he would meekly comply with the requests for money in 1993 without any protests or attempts to seek clarification on the details of the payments.
 11.In my opinion, the district judge considered these facts fully in his assessment of the evidence. He found that the respondent`s defiance, as demonstrated in his taking part in contests and shows not sanctioned by the SABBF in the 1980s, occurred years before the money was alleged to be taken by Paul Chua. The respondent had paid the price for his defiant conduct, suffering an 18-month suspension and a life-ban. The respondent was therefore well aware of the influence of the SBBF and, whether mistakably so, of its President, Paul Chua. The respondent had rejoined the SABBF in 1988 and by 1993, he had aged five more years and was busily participating in competitions sanctioned by the new SBBF and the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) of which Paul Chua was the president and vice-president respectively. The district judge had also considered the respondent`s late attendance at training sessions and accepted the respondent`s explanation that it was due to legitimate reasons rather than an act of pure defiance.
 12.As for the respondent`s expression of dissatisfaction in the press, the district judge noted that the reports contained no adverse comments against Paul Chua and that it was the unrebutted evidence of the respondent that he had the support of Paul Chua in protesting about the injustice in the judging of the Coca Cola/
 Sunday Times 
 Sports Star award and about the prize money for the Sportsman of the Year award. In fact, the newspaper exhibit carried a photograph featuring both the respondent and Paul Chua. Paul Chua`s support for the respondent`s concerns was also evident from the tenor of the newspaper reports. The district judge therefore accepted the respondent`s explanation that he had complied with the requests for money because he was fearful that he might be banned again. I saw no ground for interfering with the district judge`s finding.
 13.Secondly, the prosecution alleged that the district judge erred in disregarding the fact that the respondent had a motive for fabricating allegations against Paul Chua. The respondent had readily admitted that he was angry with Paul Chua for not supporting his close friend Jojo Sinclair in the doping scandal which surfaced in November 1995 and because he had reneged on his promise to help the respondent find sponsors.
 14.Again, this was a matter of evidence. Dealing with the first source of unhappiness, the district judge found it unlikely that the respondent would collaborate with Jojo Sinclair in fabricating allegations against Paul Chua when he should be well aware that Paul Chua had endorsed Jojo`s nomination as the Sportswoman of the Year despite his knowledge that she was tested positive for barbiturate. The district judge found it difficult to believe that the respondent would make such a serious allegation to the CPIB in April 1996 when his unhappiness stemmed only from the fact that Paul Chua failed to withhold the positive results of her drug test. As for the second motive, the district judge found that, although the respondent had encountered financial difficulties in his professional bodybuilding career since 1994, it was highly improbable that the respondent would, after more than two years, suddenly decide to give false information about Paul Chua, merely because Paul Chua had gone back on his word to get him a sponsor.
 15.In coming to these conclusions, the district judge had been persuaded by the fact that the respondent was neither the complainant nor the informer who caused the CPIB to initiate investigations into alleged offences committed by Paul Chua. There was also the uncontradicted evidence of the respondent that he did not know that the CPIB was looking into the affairs of the SBBF and Paul Chua before going there on 12 April 1996. The district judge therefore had serious doubts that the respondent would, on the very day he went to the CPIB, decide to fabricate such serious allegations against Paul Chua simply because he considered that Paul Chua had not done enough to protect and clear Jojo Sinclair`s name or because Paul Chua had gone back on his promise to get him a sponsor.
 16.In my view, the district judge`s findings were sound. There was no evidence of such misgivings over the two incidents that would have motivated the respondent to fabricate allegations against Paul Chua, considering the circumstances under which P4 was made. While the absence of motive need not necessarily mean that no intention was present, the failure to attribute a motive to the respondent`s actions in the present case did nothing to bolster the prosecution`s case that an intention to make false allegations was existent.
 17.Thirdly, the prosecution contended that the district judge erred in accepting the respondent`s evidence as to Paul Chua`s alleged misconduct. It was inconceivable why the respondent did not query Paul Chua on the need to entertain judges to help him win when he felt that he had won the competition on his own merits. It was also difficult to understand why the respondent did not think about reporting Paul Chua to the authorities, considering his disgust about corruption in the sport of bodybuilding. The respondent had shown himself to be one who was not afraid to demonstrate his dissatisfaction or to speak out against the injustice done to him. Despite winning the second place in the Coca-Cola award and a prize money of $3,000, he returned the award and prize money because he felt that the judging process was unfair. He was not concerned about losing the $3,000 which would have been of assistance to him in his bodybuilding programme. It was therefore the prosecution`s submission that the respondent did not report Paul Chua`s alleged misconduct because there was in fact none.
 18.In my view, these arguments had already been dealt with by the district judge when he found that the respondent`s public demonstration of dissatisfaction enjoyed the support of Paul Chua. The respondent`s reticence to query Paul Chua as to the necessity of the payments or to report the alleged misconduct was consistent with his evidence that Paul Chua was in effect the authority. Whether this was so in actual fact was another matter altogether.
 19.The prosecution also contended that the district judge erred in finding the respondent a credible witness and in failing to adequately consider that his frequent lapses of memory pointed to evasiveness on his part. Although there were allegedly numerous occasions when Paul Chua requested money from him, the respondent was unable to remember, besides the occasion stated in para 9 of P4, other occasions when such a request had been made. In fact, he was unable to recall when was the first time Paul Chua made such a request; the number of times when such incidents happened; the various amounts of money which Paul Chua had obtained from him; and whether there were any occasions before, or after the 1993 Pro-M Classics when Paul Chua had made such a request. The prosecution contended that, if there were indeed such occasions, one would have expected the respondent to provide some account of these transactions. A reasonable inference to be drawn from this was that Paul Chua had never made such requests. The allegations in paras 9 and 10 in P4 were therefore false and made by the respondent knowing them to be so.
 20.The district judge had already taken the respondent`s fallibility of memory into account in ordering his acquittal: 
136 I could not accept the prosecution`s submission that the accused`s numerous claims to forgetfulness cast grave doubts on whether he was in fact telling [the truth] in paras 9 and 10 of exh P4, which related to events occurring in 1993. For a man like the accused, who was involved in numerous activities, overseas trips, media controversy, disciplinary matters as well as his constant training throughout the years, from the time he participated [in] competitive bodybuilding in 1980, it was reasonable to expect him in 1996 (in P4) and in 1997 (in court) to forget certain matters which had transpired in 1986 and 1993, while he could remember other matters. Furthermore, the fact that the accused was visibly slow in understanding questions asked of him and his slow response, should not also be interpreted as evasiveness on his part. He was forthright and frank in admitting that he was angry with PW5 about his passiveness in Jojo`s doping scandal and about PW5`s failure to keep his word to get sponsors for the accused.
 The district judge had also observed the respondent`s inability to understand questions and his taking time to answer them to be genuine and did not think that the respondent was being evasive.
 21.Essentially, the prosecution`s appeal was against the district judge`s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, in particular the respondent, and against the district judge`s failure to draw certain inferences from the evidence. Having perused the evidence, I was of the view that the district judge`s findings were neither against the weight of the evidence nor unsupportable. The inferences suggested by the prosecution were also far from irresistible. It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge`s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong: see 
PP v Poh Oh Sim
 
[1990] SLR 1047
 .
 22.Before me, the prosecution argued that since the district judge did not make a finding that Paul Chua`s evidence was unsatisfactory or inherently unbelievable, the allegations must be false, thus making out the charges against the respondent. I rejected this argument because the crux of the issue was not so much whether the statements were false but whether the respondent knew that they were false. In this regard, it was a defence to show that the statements were made as a result of a genuine mistake.
 23.There was no doubt that several details in para 9 of P4 were incorrect. In particular, the respondent`s prize money was US$4,500 instead of US$5,000 and this was not forwarded to the SBBF by the organising committee but given in cash to the respondent. The respondent however ventured an explanation for these mistakes. He made the mistake that his prize money was forwarded to the SBBF because he had received the money from the SBBF in 1991 when the competition was held in Singapore. As for details as to the date and the amount of the prize money, he had made mistakes because there were many competitions going on every year and it was difficult for him to remember when and how much money was involved. There was a dispute as to whether the respondent had received the prize money on the platform when he was announced the winner, as alleged by the prosecution, or whether he had only received the money at the farewell dinner after the competition, as alleged by the defence. This, in my view, was inconsequential and did not constitute the sting of the charge.
 24.The respondent maintained, however, that it was true that he gave $1,000 to Paul Chua because Paul Chua said that he had helped him to win by entertaining the judges. In fact, Paul Chua had taken part of his prize money many times by giving him only part of the prize money that he had won. The respondent raised two examples: when he won the Sportsman of the Year award and when he won the Meritorious award. As for para 10, the respondent asserted that the $3,000 was to host a party for the bodybuilders, their families and the SBBF officials after the World Games competition. Paul Chua did not ask him for $3,000 so that he could help him win the World Games Championship in Holland. He had made this statement because Paul Chua often talked about being the Vice-President of the IFBB, knowing all the judges and being able to take them around for a drink or to entertain them. Upon more careful thought on reaching home, he realised that he had made a mistake: that the $3,000 was not to entertain the judges but for the party that Paul Chua was going to organise. It was for this reason that he rang Jojo Sinclair and subsequently went to the CPIB to make corrections on 30 April 1996.
 25.As the essential element in the present case is knowledge on the respondent`s part, the test is subjective. Alternatively, the mistake has to be so incredible that the respondent must have known that the statement was false. In the present case, the respondent had raised a reasonable doubt that the statements might have been made as a result of a genuine mistake. Paul Chua held a high office in the bodybuilding circle and it was not implausible for him to talk about entertaining the judges and buying them drinks. Paul Chua himself had also testified that, in 1992 at least, the SBBF had retained part of the respondent`s monetary award for the Sportsman of the Year award. It may well be that the respondent made the mistake of putting two and two together in making the allegations in paras 9 and 10 of P4.
 26.As the district judge noted, it may be that the respondent was flippant, careless or even reckless in doing so but this did not mean that he had deliberately given false information. This was especially so taking into account the fact that the respondent was neither the informer nor the complainant who caused the commencement of investigations. He had been called up to give information and did so without the aid of any documents, relying only on his memory. In such a context, the mistakes which appeared in P4 and the inconsistencies between P4 and the respondent`s evidence were not sufficiently material to render the information, particularly those highlighted in bold in the two charges, false or incredible. The fact that the respondent had taken overt steps to correct the mistake he made in P4 so soon after the statement was made also supported his defence that he did not intend to make a statement knowing it to be false. I took the point that the allegations in paras 9 and 10 of P4 were very detailed in nature and stated in an assertive manner. While the respondent should be faulted for asserting as facts matters which he himself was not sure of, I found that his conduct fell short of the culpability required in the two charges.
 27.I then turned to the district judge`s failure to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s silence in his s 122(6) statement. Having found that statement `C` was involuntarily given, the district judge did not consider it proper to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s failure to mention his defence in his s 122(6) statement. During his examination-in-chief, the respondent testified that the same officer who recorded statement `C`, David Tan Siang Kiang, was the one who handed the charges to him and he was present when another officer, Goh Eak Kwan, read out the charges. This evidence was not challenged. Considering the respondent`s experience with David Tan on 30 April 1996 when the latter persistently refused to believe him when he said he had made mistakes in P4, it was reasonable for the respondent to think it useless to say anything and for him to expect the same treatment from other CPIB officers including Goh Eak Kwan whom he had not seen before. The district judge therefore accepted the respondent`s explanations for his silence: that he was afraid that he would be accused of lying as on 30 April 1996 and be charged a second time.
 28.The language of s 123(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) makes it clear that the court has a discretion whether an adverse inference is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. It is not the law that an adverse inference must be drawn whenever an accused elected not to say anything in his s 122(6) statement. In my view, the district judge had exercised his discretion judiciously in not drawing an adverse inference and there was no cause for any interference.
 29.In the circumstances, I was of the view that the district judge had not erred in law or in fact in finding that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. I dismissed the prosecution`s appeal accordingly.",1998-05-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

     REGINA -v- RONALD DOUGLAS GILLARD 
      
     REGINA -v- COLLEEN THERESE GILLARD 
      
    1 THE COURT: The appellants, who are husband and wife, appeal against their convictions and Ronald Douglas Gillard seeks leave to appeal against the alleged severity of the sentence imposed on him following a joint trial in the District Court, Sydney, which took place before a judge and jury between 28 April, 1997 and 6 May, 1997.2  The appellants were found guilty on the following charges:-3 Count 1: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between 1 March, 1989 and 1 June, 1990 at Sans Souci did have sexual intercourse with V, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and then under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.4 Count 2: That Colleen Therese Gillard during the same period of time and at the same place, did have sexual intercourse with V, being then under the age of 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Colleen Therese Gillard.5 Count 3: That Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard between the same dates and at the same place, did commit an act of indecency towards V, being then under the age of 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard.6 Count 4: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did have sexual intercourse with V, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.7 Count 5: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did assault V and at the time of the said assaults, did commit an act of indecency upon the said V, being at the time of the said assault under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.8 Count 6: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place, did have sexual intercourse with D, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.9 Count 7: That Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did commit an act of indecency towards D, the said D being then under the age of 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard.10  The Crown case which, by its verdict, the jury accepted with regard to each count may be summarised as follows:- Count 1: 11  The complainant V was born on 20 October, 1975. In January, 1989 she moved with her parents and sister D to Taren Point where they took up residence in a partly completed boat, which their parents were building. The accommodation in the boat was very cramped, there were no shower facilities and the family environment was poor. The male appellant worked in a scrap-yard adjacent to the boatyard where the boat was located. 12  The complainant V and her sister D used to collect cans and bring them to the metal scrap-yard where they were paid some money for them.13  The complainant V was first introduced to the male appellant by her sister D, who had been to the appellants' house swimming and looking after their two children, aged 3 and 5 respectively. V said that her parents had also met the appellants. She was first invited to the appellants' house in the same suburb of Sans Souci around April of 1989.14  On the first evening that V slept over at the appellants’ house she was given wine with her evening meal and became light headed. She went to bed at about 10.30 pm. She heard footsteps in the corridor and the male appellant came into her room and got into bed with her. He moved his hand under her underwear, touched her breast area and her vaginal area and then put his fingers in her vagina. She said it hurt. She gave evidence that she moved and he then put his finger deeper into her vagina. The appellant left the bedroom and the next morning asked the complainant V if she had enjoyed it.15  The complainant V said that she considered the appellants’ home to be a better environment than living in the partly completed boat. She gave evidence that she liked to play with the appellants’ children and to swim in the pool at their house. After the incident, which gave rise to Count 1, she continued to visit the appellants’ home about once a month, often sleeping the night.  Counts 2 and 3: 16  The complainant V gave evidence of being in the appellants’ home around January, 1990. She consumed wine at dinner and was lying on the appellants’ bed with their children. The female appellant put her children to bed in another room and following her return, the complainant gave evidence of having seen her place her husband’s penis in her mouth and thereafter to engage in sexual intercourse in her presence. The complainant V gave evidence that she wanted to leave the room, but was told that she could stay if she wanted to sleep there. She remained in the double bed and gave evidence of later having experienced the female appellant being on top of her, kissing her on the breast area, moving down towards her vagina and ultimately kissing, licking and sucking her vagina. Count 4:17  The complainant V gave evidence of having been in the appellants’ bedroom with their children when they came and carried the children out and put them to bed. One or other of the appellants had told her she could stay in the bedroom. The complainant V said that she had fallen asleep and when she awakened she found that the female appellant was on her left side and the male appellant on her right side in the double bed. The male appellant started to touch the complainant V on her vagina. She moved and he desisted. He then touched her again and started to put his finger inside her vagina. She moved once more and he then stopped, but then put his finger deeper into her vagina. She was eventually able to get away and return to her own room. Count 5:18  The complainant V gave evidence that after April, 1989 when she was bathing with the appellants’ children, the male appellant came in and got into the bath with her, washed her back, then her breast area, then rubbed and washed her vagina. Count 6:19  The complainant D was born on 26 December, 1976. She gave evidence of collecting cans with her sister V, and taking them to the scrap-metal yard where the male appellant worked. She gave evidence of the violent relationship between her parents and of the relief she felt when going to the appellants’ home.20  She gave evidence that at about Easter time in the evening of a particular day, the male appellant had asked her if she wanted a massage to which she replied “Yes”. He told her that it would be more comfortable in his bed. Both appellants and the complainant D went into the bedroom and got into bed. The male appellant massaged the complainant D’s back and she fell asleep.21  When she awoke she found her underpants were down and he was rubbing his fingers on and inside her vagina. The complainant D said that when he put his fingers in her vagina, it hurt her, he had scratched her and she was scared and nervous. D gave evidence that the female appellant at this time was also in the bed next to her and was watching television. The complainant D said that she tossed and turned to show that she was waking up and that the male appellant quickly pulled her pants on and put the blanket over her. Count 7:22  The complainant D gave evidence that at about the end of 1989 when she was staying at the appellants’ home for a few days, she was in bed in the appellants’ bedroom with their children when the young children fell asleep. They were taken to their bedroom by their mother and put to bed.23  The appellants and the complainant D were then watching a movie whilst in the appellants’ double bed. She was asked by the male appellant if she had ever seen anyone having sex to which she responded “No”. He said “Do you want us to show you?” to which she replied “No”, to which he had responded “Well we’ll show you anyway”. The appellants engaged in sexual intercourse in the bed beside the complainant D and the male appellant said to the complainant D “Look do you want to join us?” to which she responded that she wasn’t interested at all. She said she was, scared, nervous and didn’t know what to do.24  The complainants’ mother gave evidence of having been in the appellants’ home on one occasion when she saw the male appellant go into the bathroom where the complainants were having a bath. She asked him what he was doing there and received the reply “I always wash the backs of the girls”.25  The complainants’ father gave evidence that the complainants had gone to the home of the appellants with his consent, it being the Crown case that the complainants were under the authority of the appellants.26  In separate records of interview conducted by investigating police, the appellants denied they had sexually assaulted the complainants. The appellants’ case:27  Both appellants gave evidence and were cross-examined. They denied the allegations that they had sexually assaulted the complainants or engaged in acts of indecency towards them.28  Evidence was given on behalf of the female appellant that she was a person of good character. This witness had known her for some six years and had never observed any activity of a sexual nature towards children. The female appellant carried out day care for children in addition to her own two children.29  It was the appellants’ case that both complainants had concocted stories against the appellants.30  It was contended that the delay between the period when the offences were allegedly committed and when the investigating police first spoke to the appellants, i.e. some six years later, was so great as to gravely prejudice them.31  It is convenient to deal first with the following grounds of appeal: R -v- Ronald Douglas Gillard:32 Ground 1 - His Honour erred in failing to adequately direct the jury about the significance of delay in complaint.33 Ground 5 - His Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence the complaints on each case. R -v- Colleen Therese Gillard:34 Ground 4 - His Honour erred in law in failing to direct and/or directing the jury as to complaint in particular as to consistency and delay and lack of complaint in some instances.35 Ground 7 - His Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence the evidence of complaints on each case.36  The evidence of complaint by V was comprised of a conversation with her mother about the end of 1990 when she and her sister D, together with their mother, were living at Caringbah. They had moved to this location following the separation of their parents and this conversation took place some six months after the parents had separated. She told her mother that the male appellant “had touched her”.37  D said that in 1992 when on holiday in France she recounted to V what had happened to her in the appellants’ house and had later also told her mother. She said that V had been supportive of her when she recounted her experiences and “just agreed sort of thing” with what she was saying about digital penetration by the male appellant and sexual intercourse by the appellants in front of her, but she could not recall V saying that similar things had happened to her.38  V gave evidence that in 1992 during the holiday in France, at the time when she had the conversation with D, she had said that the male appellant “had touched her”.39  The complainants' mother, gave evidence of having been told by V and D of digital penetration by the male appellant and of sexual intercourse by the appellants occurring in their presence. 40  There was no evidence of complaint in relation to the second count.41  Mr Papayanni, counsel for the female appellant, whose submissions on these grounds were adopted by Ms Burgess, counsel for the male appellant, submitted that the evidence of complaint was inconsistent and more particularly was admitted contrary to the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act).42  Section 66 of the Act relevantly provides:- “(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact. (2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: (a) that person, or (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if (1) the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation”43  The representations in the nature of complaints, having been made firstly at the end of 1990, some twelve months after the alleged events, and in 1992, it is submitted that the requirement that the asserted fact be fresh in the memory of the maker of either of the complaints has not been met.44  Reliance is placed on the decision of the High Court in Graham -v- The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1491. In that case the complainant, who was the appellant’s daughter, complained to her friend of sexual offences against her which had occurred at least six years previously.45  The view expressed in this Court (from which court the appeal was brought) of the notion of “freshness” was in the context of s 66 not being “… anchored to nor determined by simple notions of the lapse of time” but is concerned with “the quality of the memory”, did not find favour.46  In the judgment of Callinan J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed at paragraph 34, his Honour said:- “… Whilst it cannot be doubted that the quality of vividness of a recollection will generally be relevant in an assessment of its freshness, its contemporaneity or near contemporaneity, or otherwise will almost always be the most important consideration in any assessment of its freshness. The Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the section laid emphasis on the “quality” of the memory and in consequence, the regard that should have been paid to the delay in making the complaint was not paid. There may be cases in which evidence of an event relatively remote in time will be admissible pursuant to s 66, but such cases will necessary be rare and requiring of some special circumstance or feature.”47  In a joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at para 4 appears the following:- “The word ”fresh”, in its context in s 66, means “recent” or “immediate”. It may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being “not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time”) but the core of the meaning intended, is to describe the temporal relationship between “the occurrence of the asserted fact” and the time of making the representation. Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here, in years. There are several reasons for adopting this construction. First the section applies only where the person who made the representation has been, or is to be, called to give evidence. To permit leading of evidence of out of court statements made by that person based upon some assessment of the vividness or quality of the recollection (as opposed to its being made very soon after the events) would be to distract attention from the quality of the evidence that the witness gives in court. Secondly, whatever a person may believe, and no matter how earnestly that person may try to be accurate, experience demonstrates that the memory of events does change as time passes. Thirdly, the exception created by s 66 should be limited in its application to those cases where the tender of the earlier statement is likely to add to the useful material before the court.”48  In our opinion the evidence of these ""complaints"", such as they were, were not admissible under s 66 as an exception to the hearsay rule because they did not have the necessary element of ""freshness"" in the sense of being ""recent"" or ""intermediate"" as is necessary in the light of the majority judgment in Graham. The lapse of time to the first ""complaint"" by V was to be measured at least in months, and the later ""complaints"" in France, in terms of years. None of the evidence of complaint was to be measured in terms of hours or days. It follows that the evidence being hearsay was not admissible: s 59(1) and did not come within any of the exceptions to that rule, in particular it did not come within the exception provided by s 66(2).49  Alternatively, it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the evidence of complaint was admissible under Part 3.7 of the Act as credibility evidence.50  Section 102 provides that evidence relevant only to a witness' credibility is not admissible, but the following sections in that Part provide a number of exceptions. Section 108(1) provides that the credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness and no leave is required; but in the present case the evidence was adduced in examination in chief.51  Furthermore s 108(3)(b) makes admissible evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if it is or will be suggested (expressly or by implication) that the evidence of the witness has been fabricated (deliberately or otherwise) provided the leave of the court is obtained. In the present case the whole basis of the defence, that the events alleged had not occurred, constituted a suggestion that the evidence of the complainants was fabricated; and so it would have been open to the Crown to seek leave to adduce evidence of the ""complaints"" as evidence relevant to the complainants' credibility, but such leave was never sought nor given, and in its absence the evidence was not admissible.52  A similar situation (i.e. no application for leave under s 108(3)) arose in Graham where the High Court held that it was by no means inevitable that leave to adduce such evidence would have been given, that would have been a matter for the trial judge when leave was sought taking into account a number of factors referred to in that case. Similar considerations apply here.53  However, no objection was taken at the trial to the admissibility of the ""complaint"" evidence, and accordingly the appellants may not rely upon this ground without the leave of this Court: Rule 4.54  The effect and application of that rule has been discussed in a number of cases including recently in R -v- PAH (CCA - 18 December 1998). Generally speaking this Court will only grant leave under Rule 4 if it is satisfied that the wrongful admission of evidence or erroneous direction, in either case not objected to at the trial, has led to a miscarriage of justice; and in particular an appeal will not be allowed on the ground of wrongful admission of evidence which was not objected to at trial if it appears that the failure to object may have been deliberate and intended to obtain a tactical advantage.55  In the present case there are features which may have led counsel not to object to the evidence of complaint so as to show up discrepancies between the evidence led at trial and the contents of the so called complaints. When V spoke to her mother late in 1990, she told her that the male appellant had ""touched her"", but apparently made no mention of digital penetration (counts 1 and 4) nor of both appellants having sexual intercourse in her presence (count 3) nor of any cunnilingus by the female appellant (count 2). The conversation between the two complainants in France two years later made no reference to the cunnilingus alleged in count 2. It would have been open to counsel to draw attention to the differences between what was said on those occasions and in evidence at the trial, as apparently counsel did to some extent (see summary of his arguments to the Jury in the Summing Up at pp 30, 31, 32, 34), and they also relied on the lateness of the complaints.56  However there is, we believe, a more fundamental problem in this case in that the whole trial appears to have been conducted as if the Evidence Act 1995 had never been enacted. At no stage, either in relation to the admissibility of the evidence of complaint or on any other issue, was any reference made to the Act. The Act commenced on 1 September 1995, the trial was from 28 April to 6 May 1997 and the judgment in Graham was delivered on 30 September 1998. 57  We do not suggest that in any case where an objection to admissibility based on a provision of the Act could have been but was not taken, leave will be granted under Rule 4, nor that such will generally be the result; but in the present case where we are satisfied that the Act was completely ignored and where the High Court has, since the trial, thrown light on the relevant statutory provisions, we consider that leave to argue the point should be granted; and for the reasons given are of the opinion that the evidence of complaint in this case was wrongly admitted, and the convictions should be set aside.58  We turn now to consider the other grounds of appeal relating to the evidence of complaint, namely that the directions in relation thereto were inadequate.59  His Honour referred to the delay in making the complaint, and pointed out (as required by Crimes Act 1900, s 405B(2)) that absence of or delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation of the offences is false and that there may be good reason why the victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in or refrain from making a complaint; but he did not balance the direction by pointing out that in evaluating the evidence of the complainants and in determining whether to believe them the Jury could take into account their failure to complain at the earliest reasonable opportunity as reducing their credibility: R -v- Harvey (CCA - 9 April 1998) see also Longman -v- The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 91, Crofts -v- The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427. Moreover his Honour failed to warn the jury that the allegations were first drawn to the attention of the police in 1995-6, which was when the appellants were first notified of them. That was some five to six years after the offences were alleged to have been committed and such delay may have made it more difficult for the appellants to prepare their defences, a matter which was aggravated by the demolition of the house thus making it more difficult to establish whether a person in the bath would have been visible from the kitchen, a reference to the mother's evidence relating to count 5. These matters should all have been brought to the jury's attention, not merely by way of summarising counsel's arguments but as part of the directions of law on how the jury should deal with the evidence of delay in complaints: Longman, supra, R -v- BL Johnston (CCA - unreported - 31 July 1998), R -v- K (CCA - unreported - 8 October 1997).60  Each of the appellants also appeal on the ground that the verdicts against them are unsafe and unsatisfactory (Ronald Douglas Gillard ground 4, Colleen Therese Gillard ground 2), and our attention has been drawn to what it is claimed were a number of discrepancies in the evidence of V compared with her statements to police and a couple of other features including what was said to be the similarities between the evidence of V relating to the third count and that of D in relation to the seventh count, and it was suggested this indicated that the two complainants may have jointly concocted the allegations. In our view the discrepancies referred to related to peripheral matters and were essentially matters of credibility for the Jury. The case involved a credit clash between the Crown witnesses on the one hand and the appellants on the other. There were no contradictions or inconsistencies relating to the essential ingredients of any of the charges and bearing in mind the advantages enjoyed by the Jury in seeing the witnesses and the principles laid down in M -v- The Queen 181 CLR 487 we are satisfied that it was open to the Jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of each of the accused. It follows that it is not appropriate to direct verdicts of acquittal and the consequence will be orders for a new trial. It will be up to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether, in the light of the health of the male appellant and the sentence imposed on the female appellant it is appropriate to proceed further.61  It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal, but as the issue will arise if there is a new trial, and we have reached a firm conclusion in relation to it, we are satisfied we should deal with the question of whether consensual sexual intercourse between husband and wife in the circumstances alleged by the Crown in counts 3 and 7 constituted ""acts of indecency"" towards the young person contrary to s 61E(2A) Crimes Act 1900, see now s 61N.62  Obviously consensual sexual intercourse between husband and wife is not of itself in any way indecent and so, because it is not indecent, if it takes place in the presence of a young person, the intercourse of itself is not an act of indecency in the presence of the young person.63  But what was alleged here was not merely consensual intercourse between husband and wife, it was allegedly accompanied by an invitation to, and encouragement of, the young person to watch and in respect of count 7, to join in. The intercourse, although not an indecent act in itself, became indecent when carried out in front of the young person, with the invitation and encouragement to watch which were both directed to or in the direction of the young person.64  We were referred to Saraswati -v- The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1, but that was a case alleging acts of indecency ""with"" a young person, contrary to the then s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, and was concerned with the question whether acts which constituted indecent assaults (contrary to s 61E(1)) and/or carnal knowledge (contrary to the then s 71) could be charged as ""acts of indecency with"" the complainant so as to avoid the requirements of the then s 78 that in the relevant circumstances prosecutions under s 61E(1) or s 71 had to be commenced within twelve months. The case throws no light on what constitutes an ""act of indecency towards"" a complainant.65  In R -v- Francis (1988) 88 Cr App R 127 it was held that a man who masturbated in the presence of children, knowing they were watching and deriving added stimulation from the fact that they were watching could be said to be committing an act of gross indecency towards them, contrary to s 1(1) of the Indecency With Children Act 1990 (UK). In our view similar considerations apply when a couple (even a married couple) engage in sexual intercourse not only in the presence of a young person but when they also invite and encourage the young person to watch.66  In view of our conclusion in respect of his conviction appeal it is inappropriate to deal with an application for leave to appeal against his sentence by the male appellant.67  The order of the Court in each appeal will therefore be: Appeal allowed; Conviction and sentence quashed; New trial ordered. **********

      70040/02  
      R v Stephen Patrick Farrell 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
    1 His Honour: On 26 August 2002, I held an inquiry pursuant to s12 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act) as to whether the accused, Stephen Patrick Farrell, is fit to be tried in respect of a charge pending against him, namely, that on 1 June 2001, at Warrawee, in the state of New South Wales, he did murder Bernadette Farrell.  
     
      
    2 I noted the determination by the Solicitor General as delegate of the Attorney General, made pursuant to s8 of the Act, that an inquiry be conducted as to whether the accused is fit or unfit to be tried in respect of the offence. Insofar as it may have been necessary, I was satisfied pursuant to s10(2) of the Act, that the question of fitness had been raised in good faith.  
     
      
    3 I noted the election of the accused that the question of fitness be determined by a judge alone. In reliance on a report by Dr B Westmore, psychiatrist, dated 8 August 2002, I was satisfied that the accused had the capacity to make the election. I was further satisfied, for the purposes of s11A, that the accused had sought and received advice in relation to the election from his solicitor, Mr Giddy.  
     
      
    4 The reasons for my finding that the accused is unfit to be tried for the offence with which he is charged are as follows. 
     
      
    5 The facts which give rise to the charge appear as follows from a police facts sheet tended in evidence. 
     
      
       
        
        About 5.15am on Friday 1st June 2001 the mother of the Defendant and victim was awoken by the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, “Dad, Bernadette’s in big trouble”. He then left and walked to his own room. The mother then walked to the defendant’s room and asked him what was wrong. He said, “She’s in big trouble”. 
        
       
       
        
        The mother then walked to victim’s room and saw the victim laying on her back on the bed with an amount of blood on the sheets. The victim was pale but still conscious. The victim said, “I’ve rung an ambulance”. The victim then made gasping noises. The mother then returned to the defendant’s room. he looked at his mother and said, “I’m sorry”. 
        
       
       
        
        During this time the father, Allan FARRELL entered the victims bedroom and saw her on the bed. He said, “What happened?”. The victim replied Stephen stabbed me”. 
        
       
       
        
        Alan FARRELL then turned his daughter over and saw a large wound to the right side of her back that was bleeding freely. Both parents then commenced CPR on the victim. The parents saw a kitchen knife of the bed near the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Police arrived a short time later and the defendant was arrested. Ambulance personnel also arrived and commenced treating the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Police asked the defendant where the knife was and he stated, “It is still in the room”. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was conveyed to Hornsby Police station and entered into custody. The victim was pronounced life extinct at Hornsby Hospital at 6.35am. The treating doctor estimated that the victim had lost 2.5 litres of blood as a result of her injury. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant refused to be interviewed on the advice of his solicitor.  
        
       
      
    6 The principles relating to the question of unfitness to be tried are sufficiently stated in two decisions. In Dennison (CCA (NSW), 3 March 1988, unreported), the following was held. 
     
      
       
        
        The question of unfitness turns upon an evaluation of the capacity of the prisoner concerned at the trial to understand the proceedings, to be able to commence instructions, to be able to formulate his plea to the charge against him, and to follow to a sufficient extent what is actually taking place in the trial. 
        
       
      
    7 The test for unfitness to be tried was described as follows in Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. 
     
      
       
        
        It is whether the accused because of mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs … to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand the purpose of all of the various court formality. He needs to be able to understand … the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; he needs to be able to make his defence or answer the charge. Where he has Counsel he needs to be able to do this through his Counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his Counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence but he must … have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his Counsel, if any. 
        
       
      
    8 The onus of proof does not rest on any particular party: s12. The question of unfitness is to be determined on the balance of probabilities: s6.  
     
      
    9 The psychiatric evidence tendered included reports by Dr A Samuels, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the accused, dated 30 January 2002 and 12 July 2002, Dr B Westmore, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the accused, dated 12 December 2001 and 23 July 2002, and Dr Y Skinner, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the Crown, dated 19 March 2002.  
     
      
    10 Dr Skinner’s opinion was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        Stephen Farrell suffers from Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia. It has been suggested that he might have suffered a drug-induced psychosis. However, he has been in the prison hospital where he is presumably unable to access drugs and alcohol, and he continues to suffer severe psychotic symptoms characteristic of a schizophrenic illness. He has no insight into the fact that he suffers from a mental illness or that his beliefs are delusional. 
        
       
       
        
        I consider that he was suffering from severe mental illness at the time that he allegedly stabbed his sister. I consider that he had delusional beliefs about his sister and acted on those beliefs at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Farrell is not fit to plead and to stand trial. He is intelligent and educated and has a good understanding of the functions of the officers of the court and of the legal proceedings. However, I do not think that he would reasonably be able to decide on entering a plea to the charge, because he believes that his sister is not dead and that his actions did not cause her any injury. 
        
       
       
        
        He would not be able to give reasonable and considered instructions to his solicitor with respect to his defence. He does not believe that he suffers from a mental illness; therefore, he would not be able to properly consider the possibility of having a defence of mental illness. He remembers the events surrounding the alleged offences. However, his description of what happened and his explanations are affected by his delusional beliefs. 
        
       
       
        
        He was obviously distressed when talking to me about the alleged offences. He continues to suffer symptoms of mental illness and I believe it is probable that his condition would be aggravated by the trial process. Therefore I believe that he is not fit to plead and to stand trial. 
        
       
      
    11 The opinions of Dr Samuels and Dr Westmore on the question of fitness to be tried were materially to the same effect.  
     
      
    12 Having regard to the psychiatric evidence, and the legal principles which apply, I was satisfied that the accused is unfit to be tried for the offence with which he is charged. 
     
      
    13 Pursuant to s14, I made the mandatory order referring the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. No further order was sought on behalf of the Crown or the accused.

      REGINA v Lloyd Anthony MURRELL 
     The appellant was convicted of murder. A conversation by the appellant was captured by a listening device and was of critical importance to the Crown case of murder. The recording was of poor quality and the contents and transcript of the conversation were disputed at trial. The appellant now appeals against the conviction on the grounds that (1) evidence in the form of opinions expressed about the words used and transcripts of what witnesses believed they heard should not have been admitted; (2) the trial Judge should have withdrawn evidence from the jury once it became clear there was significant issue and doubt as to what had been said by the appellant on the tape; (3) the trial Judge failed to give a warning to the jury on the unreliability of the transcripts; (4) the trial Judge failed to give sufficient warning as to the onus of proof of the contents of the recording; (5) the case should have been withdrawn from the jury on the basis that the Crown case was inherently weak; (6) fresh evidence now available would establish that crucial words attributed to the appellant were not uttered by him; (7) the verdict could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Held: (Allowing the appeal):Ground 1: miscarriage of justice occasioned by admission of the transcript into evidence 1. The Crown conceded, in light of new expert opinion on the contents of the tape, that the words attributed to the appellant were less inculpatory than those which it had contended at trial had been uttered by him, and that the appellant had lost a real chance of acquittal. In the light of that evidence and the concession it was necessary to allow the appeal and to quash the conviction below. Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259 applied. Ground 2: Whether a new trial should be directed and if so, in what terms the order should be made 2. The Court has a wide discretion whether or not to grant a new trial. In deciding whether to direct a verdict of acquittal or to order a new trial the Court is to have regard to the view which a reasonable jury must have reached and not the view of the court itself. In determining whether to grant a new trial it is proper to take into account among other considerations, the public interest in the proper administration of justice as well as the interests of the individual accused.Pedrana (2001) NSWCCA 66; Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 184 CLR 627; Honeysett (1987) 10 NSWLR 639 applied.  3. On the evidence available in the present case, a properly instructed jury would have to entertain a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt of murder. However, the words spoken by the appellant and his actions provided sufficient evidence for a charge of manslaughter based upon a common enterprise to shoot up the premises, or of accessory after the fact to murder. 4. The question then is whether a verdict of acquittal of murder should be entered and an order made directing a new trial for a lesser offence; or whether there should simply be a quashing of the conviction and an order for a new trial generally. The power of the Court to order a new trial on a lesser count is supported by the words in s 8 (1) Criminal Appeal Act, ‘the Court may…order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit’ and has some support in prior authority.Kelly (1923) 32 CLR 509; Miller (9157) ALR 749; Hanias (1976) 14 SASR 137; Callaghan (1952) 87 CLR 145 considered. 5. In circumstances where the original jury had not needed to consider the lesser offence of manslaughter and where the Court still considered that offence to be available it would be inappropriate to enter a verdict that operated as a general acquittal. In order to avoid any residual question of autrefois acquit arising, in the event of the appellant being reindicted for manslaughter or accessory after the fact to murder, the proper course is to order a new trial generally, leaving it to the Director of Public Prosecutions to prefer a count or counts which the available evidence would support. ORDERS PROPOSED:(1) Appeal allowed, conviction and sentence quashed.(3) New trial ordered.

     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted after trial of the murder of Ahmed Homsi, on the night of 9 November 1997. He now appeals against that conviction upon grounds which essentially turn upon the admission into evidence of a conversation in which he participated, and which was captured by a listening device. 
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
     2   The Crown case, in summary, was that the appellant and another man, “Norm”, participated in a joint criminal enterprise to fire a shotgun at the home of the victim. It was the Crown case that Norm was responsible for the shot, which was fired through the closed front door of the home, and which struck the victim while he was standing in the hallway. Another shot had been fired through the front window of the house into the lounge room before the fatal shot, without striking anyone. 
     3   Upon the Crown case, the victim walked into the hallway after the first shot, when he was called out to face the shooter “eye to eye”. 
     4   The shooting, it was alleged, followed an argument four days earlier over a car accident, outside the victim’s home, in which a friend of the appellant, Stacey Stephens, had crashed into the parked car of one Said Beyroutieh. That man had been an employee of the victim. The ensuing argument involved a significant number of associates of Beyroutieh, including the victim, and it was one in which the appellant had participated, after being called to the scene by Ms Stephens. It was described as an intimidating scene, and it was alleged that the appellant had been stopped when he endeavoured to start Ms Stephens’ car, and that he had challenged Beyroutieh to a fight. 
     5   Following the shooting, police installed a listening device in the home of the appellant, under authority of a warrant granted on 2 June 1998, in relation to suspicion of his involvement in armed robberies. It is in relation to the product of a recording made of a conversation on 16 June 1998, between the appellant and Lisa Simpson, that this appeal turns.  
     6   The Crown alleged that the recording of this conversation, which was significantly affected by background noise, but which had been transcribed by Detective Maree (Ex J), revealed that: 
      
       
      a) Simpson asked the Appellant if he had seen a programme on Channel 7 “Australia’s Most Wanted” (on 6 April 1998), which had featured a re-enactment of the shooting; 
       
       
      b) the appellant replied that he had, and gave a description of the events leading to the shooting, in which he allegedly said that: 
       
       
       (i) Norm had asked him to go with him to the victim’s house; 
       
       
       (ii) Although he was reluctant to go, because Norm had been drinking, he agreed to the request; 
       
       
       (iii) He and Norm stole a car near the victim’s house; 
       
       
       (iv) “Norm went bang through the window”; 
       
       
       (v) he said to Norm, “Norm,  
      through the door 
      ” and that he “could see the bloke someone walkin’ down towards the door, the hall light was on I could see the shadow”; 
       
       
      (vi) Norm then fired the shotgun through the door; 
       
       
        
        (vii) he said, “Cause what happened the first shot went in through the window, they heard it they come out to have a look and I saw this cunt. I could see a shadow underneath the door and I said Norm  
        fuck the front door 
        ”. 
        
       
       
     7   The Crown also relied on a second listening device intercept, of a conversation on the evening of 27 June 1998. This was the night before the date on which the appellant had arranged to speak to police. That conversation, which took place between him and two other people, the Crown alleged, revealed that he had said that: 
      
       
      a) he would not tell them what Norm had done but, in response to a question about whether he had bashed somebody or something, he said “it’s worse than that”; 
       
       
      b) he was going to tell the police in the morning that he went to a car accident and that he did not know anything about what happened after that; 
       
       
      c) he would trust Stacy as much as Norm and that “she won’t say fuckin’ nothing”. 
       
     8   On the following day the appellant was interviewed by police in relation to the car accident, in the course of which he admitted to having had words with one of the persons present. He did not make any admissions as to his complicity in the shooting. 
     9   The recording of 16 June 1998, was enhanced by an audio engineer Lachlan Mitchell, in an attempt to remove background noise. His transcript of the conversation (Ex N), following enhancement, differed to some extent from Detective Maree’s transcript, in that he noted the appellant as saying: 
      
       
        
        a) “… we went over there fuck it, stole a car, went round there [indistinct] bang! ‘did you hear that?’ I said ‘ 
        not through the door 
        , I can see him’”; 
         
         
         b) “ ’cause what happened, the first shot went in through the window, they heard it. They come out to have a look, I seen the cunt walk through, I could see the shadow underneath the door. I said ‘Norm,  
        mind the front door’ 
         …” . 
        
       
       
       
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
     10   It was the appellant’s case that he had not gone to the victim’s home for the purpose of discharging a firearm or of occasioning anyone harm. Rather, it was his account that somewhat reluctantly, he had given in to pressure from Norm and had been taken with him by Stacey Stephens, to the home of the victim, in order to steal the motor vehicle which had been involved in the accident. As it was not there, they stole another car some blocks away, and drove back to the victim's home, to see whether the vehicle for which they had originally been looking, had returned. 
     11   Once there, he said that Norm got out of the vehicle, and went berserk, yelling out at the people in the house, before going over to the victim’s house with a bag in his hand. From his position in the car he heard a big bang and saw a flame. He realised that Norm was shooting at the house and he went over in an attempt to stop him. On his account, he said to Norm “No no” and then, when he saw a shadow under the door, he said ‘No no, not the front door”. Norm, however, fired another shot which went through the front door. 
     12   Having listened to Detective Maree’s transcript, the appellant suggested that there should be some correction to pages 15 and 16 of it, based upon what he recalled of the conversation with Miss Simpson, and upon what he could hear of it, as follows: 
      
       
        
        a) “I said  
        not 
         through the door, I could see the bloke, someone walkin down towards the door, the hall light was on and I could see the shadow … I said  
        no 
         Norm … he goes fuckin bang”; 
         
         
        b) instead of “Yeah it was a bit gory” I said “ 
        it wasn’t meant”. 
         
         
        c) “We didn’t really go there to do that  
        yeah we didn’t …”. 
         
         
        d) 
          
        “I could see a shadow underneath the door I said Norm 
        , no 
         the front door.” (Ex 3) 
        
       
     13   In his case, three witnesses with audio engineering experience were called, and there were tendered transcripts of further enhancements of the recording of 16 June 1998. A transcript of an enhancement made by Mr Young (Ex4) revealed the following relevant passage of conversation attributed to the appellant: 
      
       
        
        (i) “I said, ‘Norm,  
        not through the door 
         … ‘ I could see the bloke, someone walking down towards the door, the hall light was on and I could see the shadow … I said ‘ 
        no Norm 
         I told you someone’s there”; 
         
         
        (ii) “It wasn’t meant ..” instead of “Yeah it was a bit gory …”: 
         
         
        (iii) “We didn’t really go there to do … yeah we did …” 
         
         
        (iv) “Cause what happened, the first shot went in through the window, they heard it, they come out to have a look and I saw this cunt. I could see a shadow underneath the door. I said ‘ 
        Norm not in the front door’ 
        ”;  
        
       
     14   Gregory Edgword, a former radio operator also produced an enhanced disc and a transcript (Ex 6) which recorded the relevant passages as “not through the door” and “… they came out to have a look, I said ‘let’s fuck off’ Cos I could see a shadow underneath the door, I said ‘Norm not in the front door’”. 
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
     15   The Crown relied on the Maree version tendered in its case to establish a joint enterprise to shoot the victim. The versions advanced in the defence case were, however, relied upon to rebut the theory of joint enterprise, or in the alternative, to demonstrate withdrawal from it The version enhanced by Lachlan Mitchell was relied upon for the same purpose. In substance, it was the defence contention that it was only Detective Maree’s version which supported the prosecution case, and that this version was contradicted by the evidence of the other witnesses. 
     16   It is common ground that the recording of the conversation of 16 June was of critical importance for the Crown case of murder, particularly in so far as the prosecution version suggested that the appellant had encouraged Norm to fire at the shadow which he could see at the front door. It was also critical for the defence case so far as the appellant asserted that it supported his evidence of warning Norm not to shoot at or through the door. That it was critical, was pointed out several times by Studdert J, in the course of the summing up. 
     17   A number of grounds of appeal have been advanced, all of which turn upon the tender of evidence of the conversation. They are as follows: 
      
       
      a) evidence should not have been admitted in the prosecution case, in the form of the opinions expressed about the words used, and the transcripts of what the witnesses believed they had heard - having regard to its poor quality and to the risk of impermissible prejudice outweighing its probative value; 
       
       
      b) his Honour should have withdrawn the evidence from the jury once it became clear, as the trial progressed, that there was a significant issue and doubt as to what had been said by the appellant; 
       
       
      c) his Honour failed to give sufficient warning to the jury concerning the possible unreliability of the transcripts; 
       
       
      d) his Honour failed to sufficiently direct the jury concerning the onus of proof as to the contents of the recording; 
       
       
      e) at the close of the Crown case the case should have been withdrawn from the jury upon the basis that the evidence relied upon by the Crown was inherently weak, vague and inconsistent with the other evidence;  
       
       
      f) the fresh evidence now available arising out of the report of Dr. Joanne Tibbitts, a specialist in forensic sound and video analysis, would establish that: 
       
       
      (i) the crucial words attributed in Detective Maree’s version to the appellant had not been uttered by him, but that conversely the words uttered were largely as he had contended; 
       
       
      (ii) the tape from which the enhanced recording had been made had either been tampered with, or that the tape provided by the DPP to the appellant’s legal advisers as the original recording, was not in fact the original recording; and 
       
       
      g) the verdict was not one that can be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
       
     18   The Crown has conceded, in the light of Dr. Tibbitts’ report, which it accepts to be admissible as fresh evidence, and in the light of further examination of the tape by its own expert, Dr. Helen Fraser, that the conversation attributed to the appellant was less inculpatory than that of which Detective Maree gave evidence.  
     19   In this regard, there appears to be agreement between them, with some minor differences, that the appellant had spoken words to the following effect: 
      
       
        
        “… Norm went bang through the window … and I (said or told him)  
        not through the door 
         … (cos or see) I could see … someone walking down towards the door. … the hall light was on and I could see the shadow .. he went fucking bang … I said (says)  
        no Norm 
         .. I’m tellin you there’s someone behind the front door.” 
        
       
       
      And later: 
       
       
        
        “The first shot went in through the window. They hear it. They come out to have a look and I seen the cunt walking through … I could see the shadow underneath the door. I said Norm ( 
        mind or not in 
        ) 
         the front door 
        .” 
        
       
     20   During the course of argument on appeal, Counsel accepted that it was now likely that there would be substantial consensus as to the terms of the recorded conversation, if the matter were to be sent for retrial. Some minor differences may remain but the critical passages would substantially be agreed to. 
     21   In those circumstances, the Crown accepted that the appellant had lost a real chance of acquittal for the offence of murder. Put another way, it accepts that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant of the offence had the present evidence been before it. The test enunciated in Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259 for the setting aside of the verdict upon the basis of fresh evidence, is accordingly met. This clearly was a proper concession by the Crown which leaves this Court in a position where it must allow the appeal and quash the conviction below. 
     22   The sole question which remains is whether a new trial should be directed and if so, in what terms the order should be made. The power to grant a new trial arises under S 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “8(1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
        
       
     23   The Court has a wide discretion whether or not to grant a new trial: Gerakiteys (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 321. As Murphy J observed in King (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 426 to 427: 
      
       
        
        “Under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) a new trial should only be ordered where it would more adequately remedy the miscarriage of justice than any other order the court is empowered to make. 
        
       
       
        
        A new trial is not the inevitable result of a successful appeal against conviction. The onus rests squarely with the prosecution to show the court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy. In  
        Cheatley v The Queen 
         (1981) Tas SR 123, at pp.137-138, the correct approach is clearly spelled out by Everett J: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘My conclusion is that there is no presumption in favour of a second trial being ordered when an appeal succeeds, and that the discretion of the court must be exercised on a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances. The accused should be accorded neither more nor less personal consideration than the overall justice of the case requires in recognition of the public interest in the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice. I do not accept the counter argument on behalf of the prosecution that ‘the ordinary course should apply.’ I do not consider for the reasons I have expressed, that there should be any ‘ordinary’ course. Each case is individual and should be determined on the basis of the facts and all relevant considerations which apply to it - not to a different case. It is a negation of the wide discretion vested by statute in the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal to suppose that a common mould exists and that all cases should be judged within its framework.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Section 404(1) of the Criminal Code (Tas) is in substantially similar terms to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW)). 
        
       
       
        
        Where there was insufficient evidence at the original trial to warrant a conviction or if the evidence that will be available at any new trial is insufficient then it would be contrary to the interests of justice to order a new trial. The appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right:  
        Reid v The Queen 
         (1980) AC 343 at 349-350;  
         R v Wilkes 
         (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518,  
        Andrews v The Queen 
         (1968) 126 CLR 198 at 211,  
        Gerakiteys v The Queen 
         (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 321, 322, 331;  
        Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler 
         (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630 and  
        Cheatley (1981) Tas SR at 138. 
        
       
     24   As Ipp AJA said in Pedrana (2001) NSWCCA 66, (at para 10-11) in deciding whether to direct a verdict of acquittal or to order a new trial, the Court is to have regard to the view which a reasonable jury must have reached, and not the view of the court itself. Where it concludes that, as a result of fresh evidence, it would have a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right. 
     25   The distinction between those cases where the appellant is entitled to an acquittal of right, and those where a new trial is to be ordered, needs to be carefully borne in mind, as Pedrana emphasised. 
     26   In determining whether to grant a new trial it is proper to take into account, among other considerations, the public interest in the proper administration of justice as well as the interests of the individual accused: Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 184 CLR 627, where the Court said (at 630): 
      
       
        
        “The power to grant a new trial is a discretionary one and in deciding whether to exercise it the court which has quashed the conviction must decide whether the interests of justice require a new trial to be had. In so deciding, the court should first consider whether the admissible evidence given at the original trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction, for if it was not it would be wrong by making an order for a new trial to give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement a defective case. In the present case, the admissible evidence given at the trial satisfies this test. Then the court must take into account any circumstances that might render it unjust to the accused to make him stand trial again, remembering however, that the public interest in the proper administration of justice must be considered as well as the interests of the individual accused.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Honeysett 
       (1987) 10 NSWLR 638 at 646 per Hunt J and  
      Spies 
       (2000) 74 ALJR 1263 at 1283 in relation to the discretion, the exercise of which depends upon the interests of justice. 
       
     27   In seeking an exercise of the discretion in favour of an order for a new trial, in this case the Crown submits that a jury supplied with an enhanced tape, and with a suitably amended transcript to reflect the necessary changes, and paying regard to the remaining circumstantial evidence, could properly return a verdict of murder, or at least one of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
     28   It accepts that it would have to abandon a case of joint enterprise murder depending upon specific intent, that being the first way in which it had originally put its case. However, it submits that there is still a proper case of murder to go to the jury based on the doctrine of common purpose: Johns (1980) 143 CLR 108. This alternative would involve a scenario in which the appellant went to the premises with Norm as part of a joint enterprise to fire shots at it, and contemplated that, as a possible incident of that enterprise, Norm would use the weapon to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to somebody inside the house. 
     29   The jury was directed, in this regard, in relation to murder but whether it returned its verdict on the first or second of the two bases left is obviously not apparent from the verdict itself. An express direction was also given in relation to manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, in the course of a joint enterprise to shoot up the house. It may be assumed, however, that because of the verdict which was returned, the jury did not find it necessary to consider this alternative. 
     30   The additional circumstances identified by the Crown, beyond those which would be revealed by the 16 June admissions as to the appellant’s presence at the scene of the shooting relate to: 
      
       
      a) the motive which he had arising out of his anger, in relation to the confrontation following the motor vehicle accident; 
       
       
      b) the continuing anger which he held in that regard, evident in the strong and offensive terms in which he spoke, in the intercepted conversations, of those who had been involved in the incident; 
       
       
      c) the fact that he knew Norm to be drunk and to be a person who was very violent and very abusive when in that state (a matter with which he expressly agreed in his evidence); 
       
       
      d) the absence of any mention, in the recorded conversation, of the visit having been for the purpose of stealing the damaged vehicle; 
       
       
      e) the absence of any apparent motive in Norm to attend the victim’s premises, either to steal the motor vehicle which had been involved in the accident and which was damaged, or to exact revenge upon the victim; 
       
       
      f) the suggestion that, in the ERISP, the appellant had significantly played down the earlier incident, and in particular the extent of his role in it; 
       
       
      g) the flavour of the conversation of 16 June, which, it was put, suggested even upon the most favourable basis for the appellant, that there had been a plan to shoot up the house, rather than a plan to go there simply to steal a motor vehicle. 
       
       
      h) the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Daboussi, who saw the shooting, and who said that he had seen only one man at the front of the house when the shots were fired, and who then noticed the vehicle, to which the gunman had returned, leave the scene very quickly after he reached it. This evidence, it was suggested was capable of supporting the proposition that the appellant had remained in the vehicle as the driver, in order to effect a quick escape, and also opened up the possibility that the intercepted conversation did not accurately record the events at the door, but rather was of a self serving nature to minimise the appellant’s culpability. 
       
     31   In addition to these points, the Crown identified what it suggested to be inherent improbabilities or inconsistencies in the evidence given by the appellant at trial. These related to: 
      
       
      a) the suggested inherent lack of credibility in the appellant’s account that: 
       
       
      (i) he had been reluctantly dragged down to the victim’s home; 
       
       
      (ii) Stacey had simply dropped them off, without any vehicle in which they could return home, and without checking first whether the target vehicle was there and could be started; 
       
       
      (iii) a decision had been made to steal a vehicle to drive home only after they had found the “target vehicle” to be missing; 
       
       
      (iv) he was unaware that Norm had a shotgun with him; 
       
       
      (v) the existence of any cause for belief that Mr. Beyroutieh’s vehicle would still be parked outside the victim’s home; 
       
       
      (vi) the proposition that the car was to be stolen so as to avoid paying for its repair; 
       
       
      (vii) the absence of a more determined attempt by him to stop Norm firing the second shot, for example by pushing the barrel away from the door; 
       
       
      b) the clear contradictions in the appellant’s evidence as to whether he had believed that Mr. Beyroutieh lived at the premises, and as to who had driven the car away from the scene of the shooting. 
       
     32   These further submissions in relation to suggested weakness in the evidence of the appellant, assume that in a new trial, his evidence at the first trial could be placed before the jury, either because he would give the same evidence in chief or in cross examination if called, or that otherwise the transcript could be tendered by the Crown.  
     33   Upon my assessment of the evidence which may be assumed to be available, a properly instructed jury would have to entertain a reasonable doubt about common purpose murder. It is one thing to go to premises with a loaded firearm contemplating its possible use to shoot someone, and quite another thing to go to those premises contemplating its use to shoot the premises up. Upon the available evidence, the Crown case could not in my view rise above one of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, based upon a common enterprise to call at the victim’s premises to shoot them up, or to employ the language used by the Crown Prosecutor, in the cross examination of the appellant, “to put the wind up people inside the house”. Moreover, it appears to me that even assuming the recorded conversation to have been in the terms most favourable to the appellant, the words spoken and the limited intervention offered would not constitute a withdrawal from the form of joint enterprise which is alleged in this latter respect. I am accordingly persuaded that there is a sufficiency of evidence to support that offence, so that a new trial should be ordered. 
     34   The question which was then debated upon appeal was whether a verdict of acquittal of murder should be entered and an order made directing a new trial for manslaughter alone; or whether there should simply be a quashing of the conviction and an order for a new trial generally.  
     35   Both the Crown and Counsel for the appellant questioned whether the court could direct a verdict of acquittal for murder and make an order for a new trial confined to the lesser offence of manslaughter. That a power to order a new trial on a lesser count exists, in appropriate cases, is suggested by the presence, in s8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, of the words “the Court may … order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit”.  
     36   Although Counsel were unable through their research to find any instance where this had occurred, there is in fact precedent for it in Kelly (1923) 32 CLR 509, a decision that has been followed in Miller (1951) ALR 749; Hanias (1976) 14 SASR 137 and Callaghan (1952) 87 CLR 115. Kelly was a case where the accused had been convicted at trial, on an indictment for murder, only of manslaughter; Miller is, however, more directly in point, since the jury had there convicted of murder, but on appeal that conviction was quashed. A new trial was directed for manslaughter alone. The Court did not in that case direct an acquittal for murder. 
     37   There is also support for the proposition that where, on an indictment for murder, there has been no general acquittal, and the record shows that, while the jury acquitted the prisoner of murder, they were discharged without giving a verdict on manslaughter, because of their inability to agree on such a verdict, the issue between the Crown and the accused of a felonious killing, falling short of murder, may properly be taken as not having been concluded; and on that basis does not give rise to a defence of autrefois acquit: Quinn (1952) 53 SR (NSW) 21. That a decision would suggest, however, that the contrary position would arise where there was a general acquittal. 
     38   Applying the reasoning in that case, it would follow that, if the verdict now entered in this Court was one of general acquittal, then it would also operate as a discharge upon the original indictment of the appellant on the charge of manslaughter. However, in circumstances where the original jury had not needed to consider the lesser offence of manslaughter and where the Court considered that offence to still be available, it would, in my view, be inappropriate for this Court to enter a verdict that operated as a general acquittal on the indictment. 
     39   The difficulty which arises in this regard is that, as a matter of law, a plea of not guilty to an indictment charging murder is a “plea of the general issue to every allegation of fact necessary to make the killing a felony” whether it be that of murder or manslaughter (per Owen J in Quinn at 24). As Herron J put it in Quinn at 27, “an indictment operates so as to charge the accused, not only with the major charge specified in it but with any lesser offence for which on such charge he becomes liable to conviction”. 
     40   Earlier, at 25-26, his Honour noted that the plea of autrefois acquit: 
      
       
        
        “… is based on the doctrine of  
        res judicata 
        . It may best be re-stated by citing the oft-quoted passage from Lord Reading’s judgment in  
        R v Barron 
         (1914) 2 KB 570 at 574: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The principle on which this plea depends has often been stated. It is this, that the law does not permit a man to be twice in peril of being convicted of the same offence. If, therefore, he has been acquitted, ie found to be not guilty of the offence, by a court competent to try him, such acquittal is a bar to a second indictment for the same offence.  
          This rule applies not only to the offence actually charged in the indictment, but to any offence of which he could have been properly convicted on the trial of the first indictment. Thus an acquittal on a charge of murder is a bar to a subsequent indictment for manslaughter, as the jury could have convicted of manslaughter”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        For the plea to be well founded there must, on the former charge, have been a legal verdict returned. This means that a verdict of not guilty or guilty of the crime charged must have been found for or against the accused. It is sufficient to support the plea to show that a verdict of guilty has been returned by a jury which is  
        subsequently set aside on appeal 
        , eg on the ground of wrongful admission of evidence and  
        where the Court of Appeal discharges the prisoner 
        . If an accused person is again put on his trial under circumstances of that sort, it is quite clear that he could plead a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court to try him again:  
        Reg v O’Keefe 
         (1893) 15 NSWLR 1. Perhaps in such a case the plea of  
        autrefois acquit 
         may not be quite apt, but there is a res  
        judicata 
        . The principle is that a man is not to be prosecuted and stand in jeopardy twice for the same offence. 
        
       
       
        
        But there must be a legal verdict. If no legal verdict is returned at the first trial, the prisoner is not to be regarded as being in jeopardy, and he might be tried again. There must be a true  
        judicata 
         and not merely proof of the  
        res 
        .” 
        
       
     41   The common law position, noted in this decision, is confirmed in S 125 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which provides: 
      
       
        
        “125. If under any Act a person who is tried for a serious indictable offence may be acquitted of the offence but found guilty of some other offence, the person is not liable to further prosecution on the same facts for that other offence.” 
        
       
       
      Although s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 does not expressly provide that a person charged with murder may be convicted of manslaughter, that is implicit both in the Section and at common law. 
       
     42   It would be prudent to avoid any residual question of autrefois acquit arising, in this case, it being one in which the original jury obviously did not consider manslaughter, and being one in which I am of the view that the Crown should be permitted, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, to re-indict the appellant for that offence, or for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder (an option that is open to it both as a matter of law: Nicholas (1989) 45 A Crim R 299, and upon the available evidence).  
     43   The proper course, I consider, is not to enter a verdict of acquittal, or to order a new trial on manslaughter alone. Rather, the preferable course is to quash the conviction and to order a new trial generally, thereby precluding any argument that, by the Court’s order, the Director of Public Prosecutions could not present an indictment charging either as a single count or as a back up charge, the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, which may turn out in fact to be the more appropriate charge. 
     44   Any concern which the appellant may have that the Crown could use the opportunity so given, to bolster a case of murder by gathering new evidence to support such a charge, is lacking in foundation. The inappropriateness of ordering a new trial to allow that to occur was noted in Wilkes (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518 per Dixon J, by the Court in DPP (Nauru) v Fowler in the passage cited earlier, and by this court in Ward (1989) 42 A Crim R 56. There is no suggestion that this is what is proposed in the present case. 
     45   The decision whether a second trial should proceed for manslaughter, or for accessory after the fact to murder, can in my view be safely left to the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a discretion which it may be assumed will be exercised responsibly, having regard to these remarks, before framing an indictment which the evidence is capable of supporting. 
     46   I would accordingly propose that the appeal be allowed, that the conviction and sentence below be quashed. I would order a new trial. 
     47   KIRBY J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     48   MATHEWS AJ: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was sentenced in relation to two offences being: 
     
      
       
      1. The ongoing supply of heroin on 5 separate occasions contrary to s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 
       
       
      2. Deemed supply of heroin contrary to s 25 of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    2 In relation to the first count the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. In relation to the second count his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge determined that the sentences should be made partly concurrent. His Honour adjusted the commencement date of the sentence on the second count so that it commenced 3 months before the conclusion of the non-parole period on the first count. 
     
      
    4 Accordingly, the total effective non-parole period was 3 years imprisonment and the total effective sentence was 4 years and 6 months. 
     
      
    5 The applicant does not complain in relation to the terms of the individual sentences. His complaint is confined to a submission that greater concurrency of the sentences should have been provided. It was submitted “that by ordering that only 3 months of the two sentences should be dealt with concurrently, his Honour did not give sufficient effect to the principle of totality.” 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge found that the applicant was involved in a commercial business operating “above the street level of sales.” In relation to the first count there was evidence that on four occasions the applicant supplied heroin in approximately 5 gram packages. On the fifth occasion he sold 56 grams of heroin. On that day the applicant was found to be in possession of a further 75 grams of heroin which gave rise to the second charge. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly, in total the applicant either supplied, or had in his possession 151 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge did not distinguish in great detail between the facts relevant to the criminality in relation to each offence. His Honour found that the crimes were serious and that the applicant was further up the chain of sales than street sellers, some of whom were involved in the s 25A matters. His Honour found that the applicant had no regard to where the heroin which he supplied may end up and the consequences for those who might use it. His Honour determined that the potential harm to the community from the supply of the drugs was significant. His Honour found that having regard to the quantities supplied in relation to the first count and in his possession in relation to the second count, the applicant had access and control over an amount of heroin that placed “the offence as being slightly above the middle of any scale constructed for such an offence.” This conclusion was directed to the second count. 
     
      
    9 His Honour had regard to the applicant’s plea of guilty and allowed a discount of 25%. His Honour also addressed the question of totality and determined: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the fact that the second offence relates to the supply of heroin being a deemed supply, being a supply in the possession of the offender, in addition to that which comprises the fifth ingredient of the first offence, I am of the view that the sentence for the second should be partly cumulative and partly concurrent.” 
        
       
      
    10 As I have indicated the applicant does not complain that the individual sentences are excessive. To my mind such a submission would have had no prospects of success. The Court was referred to a number of decisions in relation to sentences for offences contrary to s 25A. Although the Crown contended that these decisions supported the sentence on the s 25A matter the applicant argued that each of them contained features of aggravation which were not present in the applicant’s case. The decisions were R v Siljanovski and Kostadinovic [2003] NSWCCA 38; R v Sakkar [2003] NSWCCA 26; R v Gordon [2002] NSWCCA 476. R v Bruppacher [2002] NSWCCA 182, R v Radford [2002] NSWCCA 122; R v Gill [2002] NSWCCA 93; R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 26; R v Arnott [2001] NSWCCA 497. It is unnecessary to analyse each of these decisions. There are features in some of them which would distinguish them from the circumstances of the applicant. However, the applicant does not contend that the sentence imposed on the first count was excessive. 
     
      
    11 The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to adequately distinguish between the objective criminality of each offence. In particular it was submitted that his Honour’s finding that the applicant was engaged in a commercial business, which was in part informed by evidence in relation to both counts, had caused his Honour to elevate the objective seriousness of each offence. In my opinion there is no substance in this submission. If his Honour did err in the manner suggested the consequence must have been to impermissibly increase the sentence for each offence. However, as I have indicated the applicant does not complain that the individual sentences were excessive.  
     
      
    12 The relationship between offences committed contrary to s 25 and s 25A of the Act was considered by the legislature when s 25A was enacted. Section 25A(5) deals with the possibility of double jeopardy and provides that a person who has been convicted of an offence under s 25A is not liable to be convicted, inter alia, of an offence under s 25 on the same or substantially the same facts. Accordingly, if, as happened in the present case, a person is apprehended in the course of an occasion of supply contrary to s 25A, the drugs supplied cannot form part of a deemed supply offence. Separate sentences for a breach of the separate statutory provisions must be imposed. 
     
      
    13 However, when, as happened in the present case, a person is being sentenced at the same time for breaches of s 25 and s 25A the common law principles provided in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 must be followed. In Pearce McHugh, Hayne, Callinan JJ said (at 623): 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means the offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.” 
        
       
      
    14 In the present case the sentencing judge was satisfied that the evidence supporting a breach of s 25A and s 25 justified a finding that the applicant was engaged in a commercial business. His operation was further up the chain than a street seller and he was to be sentenced accordingly. Because the final supply of 56 grams occurred on the same day as he was found to possess a further 75 grams of heroin his Honour determined that a degree of concurrency was required. His Honour was otherwise satisfied that the s 25A offences were distinct from the s 25 offence. As was accepted by counsel for the applicant the evidence did not suggest that the earlier occasions of supply had come from a larger quantity of which the residue was the 75 grams ultimately found in his possession. 
     
      
    15 Although his Honour provided a concurrency of non-parole periods of 3 months the total sentences were made concurrent by a period of 21 months. The consequence is that in relation to the breach of s 25 the applicant was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of only 9 months and a total effective term of 9 months. This was undoubtedly a lenient sentence and may in my opinion standing alone have been manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    16 The overall effective sentence was 4 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 3 years. When considering the applicant’s total criminality it was relevant that he had possessed over a short period of time a total of 151 grams of heroin and was engaged in a commercial enterprise supplying to others who would resell to users. This was a significant quantity of heroin which called for a penalty which both punished the applicant, deterred him from reoffending and deterred others from taking up a business of supplying heroin. To my mind the total sentence which his Honour determined, after considering the individual sentences and matters of concurrence was appropriate. 
     
      
    17 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    18 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons, as I do with the additional observations of Rothman J. 
     
      
    19 ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree generally with the reasons of his Honour and I agree with the orders he proposes.  
     
      
    20 An offence under section 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) is a serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. It requires, as an element of the offence, an ongoing actual supply of drugs. Invariably, in order to perpetrate an offence under section 25A, the offender would need to be in possession of illicit drugs of a quantity which would, pursuant to the terms of section 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, be deemed to be supply.  
     
      
    21 In dealing with the issue of totality in sentencing, it is important that the culpability of the offender is not double counted.  
     
      
    22 In the current circumstances, were I sentencing afresh, I would have imposed a more significant sentence for the offence under section 25 and provided for a greater degree of concurrence between the two sentences. But sentencing is not mathematical nor is any one result mandated. Sentencing judges must be allowed as much flexibility as possible provided that the sentencing process is “consonant with consistency of approach and … accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected”: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 624 [26].  
     
      
    23 While the approach of his Honour in sentencing may not accord with the same approach I would take to the “orthodox method” espoused in Mill v The Queen (1998) 166 CLR 59 and referred to in Pearce, supra, and Johnson, supra, it neither discloses error nor is error manifest.  
     
      
    24 His Honour seems to have taken an approach slightly at variance with that which is described as “orthodox” in Johnson, supra, at [26]. Nevertheless his Honour has not had regard only to the total effective sentence and his Honour has not committed error.  
     
      
    25 Further the sentence imposed would not pass the limitations imposed by section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  
     
      
    26 I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL and with the orders he proposes.

[2009] 4 SLR 549
.]
8 April 2010
Judgment reserved.
 Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
1       This is an appeal against the decision of the trial judge (“the Judge”) in 
Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim and another (Ajit Singh Hazara Singh, third party)
 
[2009] 4 SLR(R) 549
 (“the Judgment”).The subject matter of this appeal relates to a transaction that (unfortunately) went very wrong. Mr Ang Sin Hock, the appellant (who was the plaintiff in the suit below) (“the Appellant”), having consigned a parcel of gemset jewellery (“the jewellery”) to Mr Khoo Eng Lim, the respondent (who was the first defendant) (“the Respondent”), as well as Mr Ajit Singh Hazara Singh (who was the second defendant) (“Singh”) for sale, did not receive any of the sale proceeds and was unable to recover the jewellery. Not surprisingly, he commenced an action against the Respondent and Singh. Unfortunately, there had been substantial delay on the part of the Appellant in bringing a civil action against the Respondent and Singh, with the result (as we shall see) that difficulties arose, as a consequence, pursuant to the provisions of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The Appellant based his claim on a number of causes of action, including contract, conversion and fraudulent misrepresentation.
The background
Facts
2       The material facts have been comprehensively as well as helpfully set out by the Judge in the Judgment and, hence, only a brief overview of the factual background is necessary for the purposes of the present appeal.
3       As already alluded above, the Appellant was the owner of the jewellery which he collected whilst working in India. The jewellery was formally owned by REDS Gemstones and Fine Jewelry (“REDS”), a business registered solely in the name of his wife, although the Appellant was the 
de facto
 owner as well as controller of this business.
4       In August 1998, the Appellant happened to meet the Respondent by chance in Chinatown, Singapore. The Respondent had a business dealing in commodities under the name “Delta-T & Associates”. Being former colleagues, the parties renewed their friendship and even decided to go into the jewellery business together. They set up a new business called “Delta Jewellery”, the purpose of which was to procure jewellery from India for processing and subsequent re-export to other markets.
5       On 15 January 1999, the Respondent introduced the Appellant to Singh. The Respondent and Singh were in business as traders of gemstones and precious metals and, indeed, their relationship was, as noted in the court below, by no means a casual one (see the Judgment at [10]). The purpose of this meeting was to discuss a business proposition, pursuant to which the Respondent and Singh would help to procure overseas buyers for the jewellery, with the proceeds of sale being divided amongst the three men. The meeting proceeded smoothly and the parties agreed that they would meet again for the Appellant to pass the jewellery to the Respondent and Singh.
6       On 16 January 1999, the Respondent met the Appellant at the latter’s home and they went together to the bank to retrieve the jewellery. Thereafter, they went to Singh’s residence where the jewellery was handed over to Singh by the Appellant. On 26 January 1999, the Appellant prepared a consignment note on the REDS letterhead confirming consignment of the jewellery to:
[note: 1]
… Khoo Eng Lim (P/P No. 2504969A) [the Respondent] and Ajit Singh (P/P No. 1386867J) of Delta-T & Associates for the purpose of export outside Singapore.
Delay in payment
7       Under the original terms of the consignment contract, the sale of the jewellery was supposed to be completed by the end of February 1999, and the Appellant was supposed to receive approximately $300,000 from the sale. However, this did not materialise. Over the next six months, the parties continued to meet and the Appellant was given repeated reassurances as to when the sale would take place. During this period, the Appellant also mentioned to the Respondent and Singh that he was prepared to take action to either recover the jewellery or the sale proceeds if he did not receive the money.
8       On 6 September 1999, the Respondent requested the Appellant to prepare an invoice from REDS to Delta-T & Associates to document the payment of the sum of $270,725 to the Appellant for the Appellant’s share of the sale proceeds for the jewellery.
[note: 2]
 The Appellant acceded to this request even though the amount of $270,725 was lower than the $300,000 previously agreed.
The first police report
9       Notwithstanding the issuance of the invoice referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Appellant did not receive any money. Finally, on 3 January 2000, the Appellant’s patience ran out. He lodged a police report in relation to the consignment of the jewellery to the Respondent and Singh, and accused them of failing to pay him the sale proceeds as promised.
The undertaking to pay
10     The police report certainly had the effect that the Appellant had desired. On 6 January 2000, the Respondent and Singh met the Appellant and gave him a written undertaking (“the Undertaking”) to pay him the sums owed. The material parts of the Undertaking read as follows:
[note: 3]
SALE OF REDS JEWELRY
Please refer to your Report Ref No. C177509 made with the Commercial Crime Division, CID [
ie
, Criminal Investigation Department] on 3 January 2000 at 2.45 pm.
We, Ajit Singh (I/C No. 1386867J) and Khoo Eng Lim (I/C No. 2504969A) [the Respondent] undertake on behalf of our buyer in Europe that we will arrange an amount of $270,725 being payment for the abovementioned. We have also confirmed that due to delayed payment by the buyer, we will pay interest at 1% per month of this principal amount effective from 16 Aug 1999 up to the date that the money is transferred to your account. The full payment, including interest will be transferred direct from Europe to your bank account in Singapore 
not later than 29 Feb 2000
 or as soon as the buyer has made the payment. …
[emphasis added]
Further delay in payment
11     Under the terms of the Undertaking, the latest date of payment to the Appellant was 29 February 2000 (as embodied in the material words italicised in the preceding paragraph). Despite this, no money was received by the Appellant even after that particular date. The conversations between the Respondent and the Appellant continued, with the Appellant pressing for payment and the Respondent reassuring him that the money was forthcoming. Some of these communications are legally significant because they may possibly amount to acknowledgements of debt under the Act, which have the effect of extending the limitation period – a point which we will elaborate upon below.
12     Throughout this period, all the parties remained in contact with the police. The Respondent wrote several e-mails to the police informing them of his willingness to pay the Appellant. The Appellant was also briefed by the police whenever the latter received any updates from the Respondent regarding the proposed payment of the sale proceeds.
The arrest of Singh
13     On 9 July 2001, Singh was arrested by the police. He was charged with dishonest appropriation of property under s 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) the following day. Singh initially claimed trial to the charge. However, no trial took place as he subsequently changed his mind and pleaded guilty and was sentenced accordingly.
Commencement of legal action
14     On 1 November 2001, the Appellant instructed his lawyers to send the Respondent a letter of demand, demanding the sum of $300,000, with interest. The Respondent denied liability on the ground that the consignment of the jewellery was to Singh and that he had merely played the role of an intermediary. On 25 June 2002, the Appellant’s lawyers sent a further letter to the Respondent making further requests for payment. This was met with the same reply by the Respondent’s lawyers.
15     Despite the fact that the Respondent never made any payment to the Appellant, the Appellant did not (presumably due to a lack of financial resources (see the Judgment at [32])) take any further legal action until 
17 April 2006
, when the Appellant finally commenced legal action against both the Respondent and Singh.
Proceedings at trial
16     In the court below, the Appellant made multiple claims against the Respondent. These included:
(a)     a claim based on the tort of conversion;
(b)     a claim based on the tort of deceit for various fraudulent misrepresentations allegedly made by the Respondent and Singh to the Appellant; and
(c)     a claim in contract for the recovery of the sale proceeds based on the Undertaking.
17     In response, the Respondent raised, 
inter alia
, the following defences:
(a)     In respect of the Appellant’s claim based on the tort of conversion, the Respondent argued that the jewellery belonged to REDS and, consequently, the Appellant had no standing to sue. Further, the jewellery had been entrusted to Singh alone and the Respondent had never undertaken any responsibility for them. 
A fortiori
, the Respondent could not be said to have conspired with Singh in any way.
(b)     In respect of the Appellant’s claim based on the tort of deceit, the Respondent argued that he did not make the representations with the intent to deceive the Appellant, thereby tricking him into handing over the jewellery.
(c)     In respect of the Appellant’s claim in contract, the Respondent claimed that he was not liable because he had merely played the role of an intermediary and was not a party to the contract.
(d)     Finally, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant’s claims were time-barred under the relevant provisions of the Act.
The decision of the Judge
18     After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the Judge dismissed all of the Appellant’s claims against the Respondent (it should be noted that Singh did not contest the Appellant’s claims and judgment was therefore entered against him for the sum of $270,725 and interest at 12% per annum from 16 August 1999 until payment as well as costs to be taxed or agreed). In summary, the Judge held that:
(a)     The Appellant was the owner of the jewellery notwithstanding the fact that it was nominally owned by REDS. Further, the jewellery had been entrusted to the Respondent and Singh as joint bailees. However, the Appellant had consigned the jewellery to them for sale, and Singh’s act of selling the jewellery could not constitute an act of conversion either by the Respondent or Singh as the Appellant had, in the circumstances, authorised both the Respondent as well as Singh to sell the jewellery (see the Judgment at [65] and [67]). In any event, it was clear that the Appellant had waived his demand for the return of the jewellery and had accepted the money offered by the Respondent instead (see the Judgment at [65] and [66]).
(b)     The evidence adduced by the Appellant was insufficient to demonstrate that the Respondent and Singh had acted fraudulently in order to deceive the Appellant to part with the jewellery. The arrangement concerned was, in fact, “a pure commercial transaction” (see the Judgment at [72]). In so far as the alleged (and subsequent) representations relating to the sale of the jewellery were concerned, the Respondent and Singh had merely made statements of intention as opposed to representations of fact (see the Judgment at [69]) and the Appellant had also not demonstrated how he had relied on the alleged representations to his detriment (see the Judgment at [69]).
(c)     The Appellant entered into the consignment contract with both the Respondent and Singh, and the Appellant could sue the Respondent for the recovery of the sale proceeds. However, any action in contract that the Appellant could maintain against the Respondent was time-barred, even after taking into account the Undertaking made by the Respondent as well as the subsequent acknowledgments of liability (see the Judgment at [84]).
Issues raised on appeal
19     The Appellant has challenged the Judge’s decision with respect to all three claims. In particular, he argued as follows:
(a)     The Judge had erred in holding that the causes of action based on both breach of bailment as well as on conversion have not been made out against the Respondent.
(b)     The Judge had erred in holding that the cause of action based on the tort of deceit had not been made out against the Respondent.
(c)     The Judge had erred in holding that the monetary claim against the Respondent was time-barred under the Act.
(d)     The Appellant ought, in any event, to be able to surmount the problem of limitation 
via
 ss 26(2) and 29 of the Act.
20     The Respondent, on the other hand, relied, in the main, on the Judge’s findings as well as reasoning. Significantly, though, the Respondent, whilst maintaining that he had nothing to do with the transaction concerned, nevertheless did not wish to disturb the finding of the Judge that the Appellant had, at best, a monetary claim against him (the Respondent) jointly and/or severally with Singh. Indeed, this finding is clear on the facts and evidence and there was, in our view, no ground for mounting a challenge to this particular finding of the Judge in the first place.
21     We now turn to consider each of these issues. As we shall see, a 
further
 issue with regard to the monetary claim (
cf
 issue (c) above) arose in the course of oral submissions and this, as we shall also see, is an issue of the first importance in the context of the present appeal, and will therefore also be addressed accordingly. However, before proceeding to consider the various issues raised in the present appeal, we would like to observe that we agree with the other related findings by the Judge and will therefore not consider them again in the present judgment. In particular, we agree with the finding by the Judge that the Respondent was, in fact, a party to the consignment contract and was also a joint bailee of the jewellery (see the Judgment at [40]−[53]).
Does the Appellant have a claim against the Respondent in conversion?
22     The Judge found that the jewellery had been sold with the authorisation of the Appellant. Consequently, there were no grounds for alleging any act of conversion by the Respondent or Singh. On appeal, the Appellant challenged the Judge’s finding that the jewellery had been sold. In the alternative, the Appellant also challenged the Judge’s finding that the jewellery was sold with the Appellant’s authority. The Appellant argued that the sale of the jewellery in a piecemeal manner was unauthorised because he had intended the jewellery to be sold to a single buyer. We deal first with the alternative argument that there had been no authorisation for the sale before proceeding to consider the argument that there had been no sale to begin with.
Did the Appellant authorise the sale of the jewellery?
23     We reject the Appellant’s argument that the sale of the jewellery by Singh was unauthorised and therefore constituted an act of conversion.
24     First, it is undisputed that when the Appellant passed the jewellery to Singh and the Respondent, he did so without knowing to whom the jewellery would eventually be sold. In fact, at that particular point in time, all the parties had a common understanding that there might not even be a sale if Singh could not find buyers for the jewellery. Further, given this factual matrix, it is hard to believe that the Appellant would have refused to proceed with the sale if Singh had managed to find multiple buyers for different parts of the jewellery.
25     Indeed, there is no evidence to demonstrate that it was a term of the consignment contract that the jewellery had to be sold to a single buyer. In fact, the available evidence points in the opposite direction. In the Appellant’s own Statement of Claim, he repeatedly stated that the Respondent and Singh had represented to him that they would be able to procure “overseas buyers” for his jewellery.
[note: 4]
 The use of the plural suggests that the Appellant himself considered it a possibility that the jewellery would be sold to multiple buyers. Although the Appellant also utilised the phrase “overseas buyer” in the singular, this merely suggests that the Appellant regarded the question of whether the jewellery had been sold to a single buyer or to multiple buyers as inconsequential.
26     Further, even after the Respondent had represented to the Appellant that the jewellery had been sold, there was not a single instance in which the Appellant inquired about either the manner of the sale or the identity of the buyer. All that he was concerned about was when he would be given his share of the sale proceeds. This suggests that the question of whether the jewellery was sold to a single buyer or to multiple buyers was totally unimportant to him.
27     Accordingly, even if Singh had indeed sold the jewellery in a piecemeal manner, this would not have constituted an act of conversion.
Was there a sale?
28     We turn now to consider whether or not the jewellery had indeed been sold.
29     Although the Appellant challenged vigorously the Judge’s finding that the jewellery had been sold, we are of the view that the point is moot as we agree with the Judge (at [66] of the Judgment) that any potential claim in conversion which the Appellant had against the Respondent could not succeed as the Appellant had 
waived
 this claim by electing to proceed against the Respondent pursuant to a monetary claim instead.
30     The doctrine of election between alternative and inconsistent rights was succinctly summarised by Stephen J in the High Court of Australia decision of 
Sargent v ASL Developments Limited
 (1974) 131 CLR 634, as follows (at 641−642):
The doctrine of election as between two inconsistent legal rights is well established but certain of is features are not without their obscurities. The doctrine only applies if the rights are inconsistent the one with the other and it is this concurrent existence of inconsistent sets of rights which explains the doctrine; because they are inconsistent neither one may be enjoyed without the extinction of the other and that extinction confers upon the elector the benefit of enjoying the other, a benefit denied to him so long as both remained in existence. As Williston points out (
Contracts
, 3rd ed., vol. 5, par. 683) the doctrine is not out of harmony with the general rule that a binding surrender of a right requires a sealed release or consideration; by surrendering one right the elector thereby gains an advantage not previously enjoyed, the ability to exercise to the full the other, inconsistent right.
In many instances what may pass for an application of the doctrine is in truth but the inevitable consequence of the party's conduct, a consequence that would follow even if no such doctrine existed. Thus in the common case of avoidance of a contract for breach it is not any doctrine of election that prevents the avoiding party subsequently from enforcing the contract but rather the fact that the contract has, by his act of avoidance, ceased to exist; such a situation is revealed by the facts discussed by Lindley J. in 
Evans
 v. 
Wyatt
 [(1880) 43 LT 176]. On the other hand if he chooses instead to keep the contract on foot and sue for damages rather than rescind for breach recourse must be had by the other party either to election or, if the facts will support it, to an estoppel if that breach should later be sought to be relied upon so as to avoid the contract. All this is made clear in the judgment of Jordan C.J. in 
O'Connor
 v. 
S. P. Bray Ltd
. [(1936) 36 SR (NSW) 248 at 258—261]. In the present appeals the doctrine of election is directly in question since the issue is not whether following rescission the vendors may enforce the contracts but rather whether acts on their part consistent with the continued existence of the contracts prevent their subsequent purported rescission from being effective.
Reference may also be made generally to K R Handley, 
Estoppel by Conduct and Election
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 2006) at ch 14.
31     In the present case, the Appellant’s claim for conversion in respect of the jewellery is plainly one that is inconsistent with a claim for the sale proceeds under the consignment contract. A claim in conversion is premised on the claimant’s immediate right to possession. Once the claimant treats the defendant’s actions as an authorised sale, and makes a claim for the proceeds, he loses the immediate right of possession to the chattel, and any previous right to a claim in conversion is extinguished. Here, having elected to claim the sale proceeds from the Respondent and Singh (as evidenced by the invoice he issued to them, as well as by his subsequent conduct), it necessarily follows that any claim the Appellant might have in conversion was extinguished at that particular juncture.
Is the Respondent liable to the Appellant for fraudulent misrepresentation?
32     The alleged misrepresentations made by the Respondent can be divided into two categories. The first category includes representations made by the Respondent for the purpose of inducing the Appellant to hand the jewellery over to Singh. The second category consists of representations made by the Respondent to the effect that the jewellery had been sold and that the proceeds would be remitted to the Appellant. Let us consider each category 
seriatim
.
The first category of representations
33     The law relating to the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit was recently set out by this court in 
Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp
 
[2008] 2 SLR(R) 909
, as follows (at [16]–[18]):
16    The classic formulation of the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit is to be found in the judgment of Lord Herschell in the leading House of Lords decision of 
Derry v Peek
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337
, where the learned law lord observed as follows (at 374):
First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states. To prevent a false statement [from] being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this probably covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly alleges that which is false, has obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was made.
17    The principles enunciated in 
Derry v Peek
 have, in fact, been adopted in the local context (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of 
Chop Ban Kheng v Chop Siang Huah and Latham & Co
 (1925) 2 MC 69 at 71 (affirmed on appeal (id at 75-80), although the appeal did not involve the issue of fraud), 
Baker v Asia Motor Co Ltd
 
[1962] MLJ 425
 at 426, 
Malayan Miners Co (M) Ltd v Lian Hock & Co
 [1965-1967] SLR(R) 307 at [22], and 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Archer Daniels Midland Co
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 196
 at [38]; see also the decision of this court in 
Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee
 
[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435
 at [13]).
18    In the Singapore High Court decision of 
Ng Buay Hock v Tan Keng Huat
 
[1997] 1 SLR(R) 507
, Warren L H Khoo J observed (at [26]) that “[t]he essence of fraud is dishonesty”. As Lord Herschell put it in 
Derry v Peek
 at 375:
In my opinion making a false statement through want of care falls far short of, and is a very different thing from, fraud, and the same may be said of a false representation honestly believed though on insufficient grounds.
In a similar vein, the learned law lord later observed thus (
id
 at 376):
I think mischief is likely to result from blurring the distinction between carelessness and fraud, and equally holding a man fraudulent whether his acts can or cannot be justly so designated.
In a similar vein, Bowen LJ, in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Angus v Clifford
 [1891] 2 Ch 449, observed, in relation to Lord Herschell’s statement in 
Derry v Peek
 (at 374) on false representations which are made “recklessly, careless whether [they] be true or false” (see 
[16]
 above), thus (at 471):
It seems to me that a second cause from which a fallacious view arises is from the use of the word “reckless.” Now, what is the old common law direction to juries? And it is not because I think that common law is better than equity that I go back to it - but it is because an action for deceit is a common law action - the old direction, time out of mind, was this, did he know that the statement was false, was he conscious when he made it that it was false, or if not, did he make it without knowing whether it was false, and without caring? 
Not caring, in that context, did not mean not taking care, it meant indifference to the truth, the moral obliquity which consists [of] a wilful disregard of the importance of truth ...
 [emphasis added]
34     It is not disputed that the Respondent had made various representations to the Appellant to the effect that he and Singh had contacts who dealt with jewellery and that they would be able to find buyers for the jewellery. What is being disputed, however, for the purposes of the present appeal, is whether the Respondent had acted with a fraudulent intent at the time he made these representations.
35     The testimony given by Singh suggests very strongly that the Respondent truly believed that Singh (whom he was in partnership with) had contacts for jewellery buyers and that they would be able to sell the jewellery to overseas buyers. According to Singh, the responsibility for selling the jewellery was his, and the Respondent had no idea who the potential or actual buyer was. The Respondent’s responsibility in the transaction was to facilitate meetings between the parties as well as to distribute the proceeds of sale.
[note: 5]
 Singh also testified that the Respondent had no idea that he was selling off the jewellery in a piecemeal manner because he never informed the Respondent of this.
[note: 6]
 Finally, when the Appellant became impatient and started chasing the Respondent for the sale proceeds, Singh fabricated a story about how he had sold the jewellery and had not been paid by the buyer, and this story was believed by both the Respondent and the Appellant.
[note: 7]
36     To a large extent, Singh’s testimony that the Respondent was just as much in the dark about Singh’s misdeeds as the Appellant is supported by some letters and statements that were written by the Appellant to the CID.
37     In a letter to the CID dated 14
 
March 2000, the Appellant had stated as follows:
[note: 8]
The facts will show that Ajit [Singh], as he always does, is cynically mocking everyone, myself, the law and Khoo [the Respondent].
38     In another letter to the CID dated 21 March 2000, the Appellant stated thus:
[note: 9]
Khoo [the Respondent] did not know about Ajit’s [Singh’s] own plans on 15.1.99. I think it was around April 99, when Khoo [the Respondent] asked me and Ajit [Singh] to contact one another directly, that he began to feel that Ajit [Singh] was up to something more fraudulent than he was prepared to venture with Ajit [Singh].
39     During cross examination, the Appellant attempted to downplay the significance of these statements by claiming that he was merely speculating as to the role that the Respondent had played in the entire incident. Whilst it may be true that the Appellant’s own views as to the Respondent’s involvement in the incident cannot affect the legal question of whether the Respondent was indeed fraudulent, it is a relevant factor in determining whether there is sufficient evidence for the court to find that the Respondent had acted fraudulently.
40     In the absence of any other evidence demonstrating that the Respondent had intended to defraud the Appellant into parting with the jewellery right from the outset, we agree with the Judge’s finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Respondent had made the first category of representations fraudulently.
The second category of representations
41     With respect to the second category of representations made by the Respondent to the effect that the jewellery had been sold and that the proceeds would be remitted back to the Appellant, the Judge found that they were not actionable because they were not pure representations of fact but contained promises as to future action instead.
42     We agree with the Judge that the Respondent’s statement that the sale proceeds would be remitted back to the Appellant was a statement of intention that is not actionable unless the Appellant can demonstrate that the Respondent did not hold that view in good faith when he made that statement (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Edgington v Fitzmaurice
 (1885) 29 Ch D 459 at 483, 
per
 Bowen LJ). However, the same cannot be said of the Respondent’s representations to the Appellant that the jewellery had been sold. Those representations are unequivocal statements of fact that could form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation. There is no reason why an actionable representation of fact should cease to be so merely because it was uttered in the same breath as a statement of intention.
43     In the Respondent’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (dated 17 March 2008), he indicated that by 28 August 1999, his faith in Singh had been shaken because there had been no development forthcoming from Singh as to the sale of the jewellery or any report.
[note: 10]
 Yet, despite his reservations about the veracity of what Singh was telling him, up to 12 April 2000, the Respondent was still making representations to the Appellant to the effect that the jewellery had been sold and that he and Singh were in the process of obtaining payment from the buyer. Based on this alone, there is, in our view, a case to be made that the Respondent had made those representations with serious doubts about their truthfulness or was reckless as to whether or not they were true. Indeed, it might be argued that, at the very least, those representations constituted negligent misrepresentations.
44     Nevertheless, even if the Respondent had made these representations either fraudulently or negligently, this is insufficient – in and of itself – to sustain a claim based on misrepresentation. As the Judge correctly pointed out (see the Judgment at [69]), the Appellant did not provide any evidence that he relied on these representations to his detriment. On the contrary, he had already made police reports against the Respondent and Singh as early as January 2000. Hence, we agree with the Judge that the Appellant did not rely on the representations made by the Respondent.
45     The Appellant’s best case is that he forbore from commencing legal action against the Respondent and Singh because of the Respondent’s representations that the jewellery had been sold and that the proceeds would be remitted soon. Yet, even that argument is, with respect, fraught with difficulty. By July 2001, Singh had already been arrested for dishonest appropriation of property. The Appellant ought to have known by then that the representations made to him were untrue. Yet, the Appellant chose, inexplicably, to wait almost another five years before commencing legal action against the Respondent. The strongest argument in the Appellant’s favour is that the Respondent’s misrepresentations resulted in the Appellant forbearing from taking civil action against him (the Respondent) for a period of some 18 months (from 6 January 2000 (when the Undertaking was given) to 9 July 2001 (when Singh was arrested)). However, such forbearance to sue did not cause the Appellant any real loss because he still had more than four years to bring a claim against the Respondent. In the final analysis, therefore, any loss suffered by the Appellant was not due to any reliance on the Respondent’s misrepresentations.
46     In the circumstances, therefore, the Appellant’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit fails.
Does the Appellant have a contractual claim against the Respondent?
47     Under the terms of the consignment, the sale of the jewellery was supposed to have been completed by the end of February 1999. Hence, the earliest date at which the Appellant’s cause of action for the recovery of the sale proceeds would have accrued would have been at the end of February 1999 when the sale ought to have been completed. Even taking into account the fact that there were multiple delays in the sale of the jewellery, the latest time when the Appellant’s claim accrued was 6 September 1999, when the Respondent represented to him that the jewellery had been sold and asked him to prepare the REDS invoice (see above at 
[8]
). Such a claim is clearly time-barred under s 6(1)(
a
) of the Act .
48     Counsel for the Appellant, recognising that a claim based solely on the consignment contract would be time-barred, sought to overcome this hurdle by relying on s 29 of the Act as well as the doctrine of acknowledgment under s 26(2) of the Act. In so far as the former provision (
viz
, s 29 of the Act) is concerned, we agree wholly with the Judge’s reasoning as well as holding (see the Judgment at [75]−[83]) and we therefore reject the Appellant’s reliance on that particular provision.
49     Turning to the doctrine of acknowledgment under s 26(2) of the Act, an acknowledgment by a person liable for a debt or a liquidated pecuniary claim has the effect of restarting the limitation period at the time when the acknowledgment was given. Section 26(2) reads as follows:
Where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim, or any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person or to any share or interest therein, and the person liable or accountable therefor acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect thereof, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and not before the date of the acknowledgment or the last payment.
An acknowledgment under s 26(2) arises only when there is a clear admission of a claim made by the person liable under the claim (see, for example, the English High Court decision of 
Kamouh v Associated Electrical Industries International Ltd and Another
 
[1980] 1 QB 199
).
50     We agree with the Judge that the Undertaking given by the Respondent and Singh on 6 January 2000 (reproduced above at 
[10]
) constitutes an acknowledgment under s 26(2). This has the effect of extending the date from which the six year time period starts to run. Apart from the Undertaking, there are two other acknowledgments which have the same effect of extending time in favour of the Appellant. The first is a letter from the Respondent to the Appellant on 2 March 2000 reassuring him that payment would be made to him.
[note: 11]
 The second is a letter from the Respondent to the Appellant on 12 April 2000 (“the 12 April Letter”, reproduced below at 
[65]
), in which the Respondent informed the Appellant that he and Singh would be picking up a bank draft on 17 April 2000 to deliver to the Appellant on 18 April 2000.
[note: 12]
 The Judge held that the 12 April Letter from the Respondent to the Appellant could possibly have had the effect of extending the date from which the six year time period starts to run (see the Judgment at [74]). However, she held that the Appellant’s claim in contract was still time-barred because his claim was filed on 17 April 2006, a date which was more than six years after 12 April 2000. We pause to observe, parenthetically, that although the Judge observed that the 12 April Letter was not signed, there is no doubt, in our view, that that letter was, in fact, sent from the Respondent to the Appellant. This is, in fact, also borne out by the documentary context as well and the parties, correctly in our view, did not seek to argue to the contrary.
51     We agree with the findings of the Judge on this particular issue. However, that is not an end to the matter.
Fresh contract
52     During the course of oral submissions, another issue relating to the effect of the correspondence between the parties arose which was not canvassed before the court below. Understandably, therefore, it did not fall to be decided by the Judge. Nevertheless, that particular issue was, in our view, of great – even decisive – potential significance to the outcome of the present appeal. In the circumstances, we formulated the following questions that were to be addressed by counsel for the parties in further submissions, as follows:
(1)
Is paragraph 19 of the Appellant’s Reply broad enough to incorporate the contentions that as a result of the Respondent's representations,
a.
the limitation period has been extended; or
b.
the limitation period ought to be considered as having been acknowledged to run only from the expiry of the date of the last undertaking to pay; or
c.
there has been a fresh contract as a result of the correspondence between the parties?
(2)
How should the 12 April Letter be construed?
(3)
Assuming that the answer to (1) is in the negative, is it nevertheless open to the Court of Appeal to allow consideration of the points above?
The parties’ respective further submissions have since been received. We should observe at this juncture that, having perused and carefully considered the parties’ further submissions, we are of the view that the central (or key) issue for the purpose of the present appeal is embodied in question (1)(c), as reproduced above (
viz
, whether or not there has been a fresh contract as a result of the correspondence between the parties), and we will therefore focus on this particular issue only (noting, by way of preliminary observation, that the conduct of the parties (in particular, that of the Appellant) will also be relevant to the determination of this particular issue).
Procedural considerations
53     However, before proceeding to consider this substantive legal issue, we need to deal, first, with a threshold issue. Although it is of a procedural nature, it is nevertheless of great importance. Indeed, both aspects of this threshold issue are, as the reader might have surmised, embodied in questions (1) and (3), which we asked counsel to address (and which have been reproduced in the preceding paragraph). In essence, the threshold issue is this: Can this court address the substantive issue as to whether or not there was a fresh contract between the parties in the light of the fact that it had not been addressed in the court below? In particular, does para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply permit this court to consider the said issue (see question (1) above)? If not, and if this is in fact a new point on appeal, can this court nevertheless proceed to consider that issue in any event (see question (3) above)?
54     We turn now to address the two last-mentioned (and specific) questions referred to at the end of the preceding paragraph 
seriatim
.
Para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply
55     Before proceeding to consider the precise scope of para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply, it might be appropriate to consider a few general points of principle first. In this regard, the following observations on the respective roles of – as well as relationship between – procedural and substantive justice in the Singapore High Court decision of 
United Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd
 
[2005] 2 SLR(R) 425
 (at [4]–[9]) might be usefully noted:
4     It is axiomatic that every party ought to have its day in court. This is the very embodiment of 
procedural
 justice. The appellation “procedural” is important. Procedural justice is just one aspect of the holistic ideal and concept of justice itself. In the final analysis, the achievement of a substantively just result or decision is the desideratum. It is more than that, however. It is not merely an ideal. It must be a practical outcome - at least as far as the court can aid in its attainment.
5     However, the court must be extremely wary of falling into the flawed approach to the effect that “the ends justify the means”. This ought never to be the case. The obsession with achieving a substantively fair and just outcome does not justify the utilisation of any and every means to achieve that objective. There must be fairness in the 
procedure or manner
 in which the final outcome is achieved.
6     Indeed, if the procedure is unjust, that will itself taint the outcome.
7     On the other hand, a just and fair procedure does 
not
, in and of itself, ensure a just outcome. In other words, procedural fairness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a fair and just result.
8     The quest for justice, therefore, entails a continuous need to balance the procedural with the substantive. More than that, it is a continuous attempt to ensure that both are
 integrated
, as far as that is humanly possible. Both 
interact
 with each other. One cannot survive without the other. There must, therefore, be – as far as is possible – a fair and just procedure that leads to a fair and just result. This is not merely abstract theorising. It is the 
very basis
 of what the courts do – and ought to do. When in doubt, the courts would do well to keep these bedrock principles in mind. This is especially significant because, in many ways, this is how, I believe, laypersons perceive the administration of justice to be. The legitimacy of the law in their eyes must never be compromised. On the contrary, it should, as far as is possible, be enhanced.
9     It is true, however, that in the sphere of practical reality, there is often a 
tension
 between the need for procedural justice on the one hand and substantive justice on the other. The task of the court is to attempt, as I have pointed out in the preceding paragraph, to 
resolve
 this tension. There is a 
further
 task: it is to actually attempt, simultaneously, to 
integrate
 these two conceptions of justice in order that justice in its fullest orb may shine forth.
[emphasis in original]
56     In other words, the 
balanced integration
 of both procedural and substantive justice must be constantly borne in mind. One particular application of this general ideal in the context of the rules of civil procedure is to ensure that the operation of such rules does not 
itself
 engender substantive injustice. Indeed, as V K Rajah JC very pertinently pointed out in the Singapore High Court decision of 
Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 2 SLR(R) 594
 at [85] (affirmed in 
Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502
):
Rules of court which are meant to facilitate the conduct of proceedings invariably encapsulate concepts of procedural fairplay. They are not mechanical rules to be applied in a vacuum, devoid of a contextual setting.
The observations just quoted were endorsed by this court in 
Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal
 
[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537
 (at [63]), where the court also observed, as follows (at [63]):
In 
Lim Eng Kay v Jaafar bin Mohamed Said
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 156
, the court awarded special damages notwithstanding that they had been incorrectly pleaded as general damages, amply illustrating the pragmatic judicial approach that eschews refusal of a claim purely on account of a technical error of pleading. As aptly noted by Lai Kew Chai J, in 
Lea Tool and Moulding Industries Pte Ltd v CGU International Insurance plc
 
[2000] 3 SLR(R) 745
 at [16], “our procedural laws are ultimately handmaidens to help us to achieve the ultimate and only objective of achieving justice as best we can in every case [and should] not [be] permitted to rule us to such an extent that injustice is done”.
57     Returning to the present proceedings in general and para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply in particular, it would be appropriate to first set out para 19 itself, which reads as follows:
With respect to Paragraphs 11(a) to 11(f) of the said Defence (Amendment No. 
2
3
), the Plaintiff joins issue with the 1
st
 Defendant and puts the 1
st
 Defendant to strict proof. 
Specifically, with respect to Paragraph 11(d) of the Defence (Amendment No. 3), the Plaintiff will aver that subsequent to the acknowledgment and/or undertaking given by the Defendants, the Defendants made various representations from time to time requesting for additional time, to recover the money from the buyer of the Plaintiffs jewellery collection, so as to make payment of the monies due to the Plaintiff
. 
Believing the said representations to be true and being induced thereby, the Plaintiff acceded to the said requests
. The Plaintiff believed the said representations for the Defendants made similar representations to the police even up to September 2000, as was related to the Plaintiff by the police upon the Plaintiff making enquiries from time to time
. [underlining in original; emphasis added in italics]
58     A perusal of para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply (as reproduced in the preceding paragraph) suggests (especially if we have regard to the italicised words set out in the preceding paragraph) that that paragraph is, in fact, sufficiently broad to raise the issue as to whether the parties entered into a fresh contract. Whilst it is entirely possible that the focus of this particular paragraph was on whether or not there was an acknowledgment under s 26(2) of the Act, it should be borne in mind that this paragraph was directed at para 11(d) of the Respondent’s Defence (Amendment No 3), which raised the 
general
 issue of a time-bar under the Act. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the Appellant was at liberty to raise whatever arguments he thought would meet this general issue. Bearing in mind the general principles set out above, the fact that a fresh contract would overcome the Respondent’s general defence of a time-bar under the Act as well as the fact that a party is only required to plead facts (as opposed to law), we see no reason in principle why the Appellant could not raise the issue of a fresh contract based on para 19 of his Reply. This is especially the case as the Appellant was relying on his 
consent to
 the Respondent’s various requests for additional time to make payment of the monies due to him. The respective issues of whether or not there was an acknowledgment under s 26(2) of the Act 
and
 whether or not the parties had entered into a fresh contract were dependent, in the final analysis, on the 
same set of facts
 which had been pleaded by the Appellant in para 19 of his Reply (there is, in this regard and to this extent, some overlap, in fact, with the procedural issue to be considered in the next section of this judgment (
viz
, whether, in any event, a new point on appeal can be raised in the context of the present proceedings)). In the circumstances, it can hardly be said that the Respondent would be prejudiced if the latter issue is now raised and considered by this court. Indeed, it is significant, in our view, that the Appellant, in the Appellant’s Case, did refer to the fact that the Undertaking (reproduced above at 
[10]
):
[note: 13]
… 
stands independently as a collateral contract, and more than just an acknowledgement under Section 26(2) of the Limitation Act
 in that the promise to pay given by Mr Khoo [the Respondent] and Mr Singh [Singh] is 
supported by the consideration lying in the forbearance requested and in fact granted by Mr Ang
 [the Appellant], ie. to wait till 29
th
 February 2000 to be paid [emphasis added].
Although the Appellant had referred to the Undertaking, the 
same general principles
 were, in our view, potentially applicable to the 12 April Letter as construed in the context of the surrounding (and relevant) circumstances and documents as well.
59     In the circumstances, we are of the view that para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply was sufficiently wide to cover this particular issue.
New point on appeal
60     In any event, 
even if
 para 19 of the Appellant’s Reply was not sufficiently wide and the issue as to whether or not the parties had entered into a fresh contract is treated as a new point on appeal, could it still be raised and considered pursuant to O 57 r 13(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)?
61     As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC has pertinently observed (see 
Singapore Court Practice 2009
 (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 57/13/10):
Consistent with the principle of finality in litigation is the requirement that the parties should raise at trial all matters which have a bearing on the outcome of the case. The Court of Appeal will generally refrain from entertaining a new point on appeal, particularly if the circumstances are such that the court is not in as advantageous a position as the court below (with regard to the evidence as well as other matters which may have arisen if the point had been brought up in the court below), to adjudicate upon the issue.
62     The above observations (which were found in the same paragraph in 
Singapore Court Practice 2006
 (Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2006)) were, in fact, cited by this court in 
Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 571
 (at [14]). The court proceeded to observe (at [15]–[16]):
15    The classic statement of principle is, of course, that of Lord Herschell in the House of Lords decision of 
The Owners of the Ship “Tasmania” and the Owners of the Freight v Smith and others, The Owners of the Ship “City of Corinth
” (
The “Tasmania”) 
(1890) 15 App Cas 223
, as follows (at 225):
My Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial, and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most jealously scrutinised. The conduct of a cause at the trial is governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to, the points then suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to them.
 
It appears to me that under these circumstances a Court of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness box.
 
[emphasis added]
The principles embodied in the above quotation have been cited and applied on a number of occasions in the local context (see, for example, the decisions of this court in 
Cheong Kim Hock v Lin Securities (Pte)
 
[1992] 1 SLR(R) 497
 at [30]; 
MCST Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 418
 at [38]; and 
Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat
 
[2005] 4 SLR(R) 234
 at [35]).
16    The following observations by Lord Watson in the Canadian Privy Council decision of 
Connecticut Fire Insurance Company v Kavanagh
 
[1892] AC 473
 at 480 are, especially (as we shall see) in the context of the present proceedings, also apposite:
When a question of law is raised for the first time in a court of last resort, upon the construction of a document, or 
upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient, in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea
. The expediency of adopting that course may be doubted, when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact, in considering which the Court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the Courts below. But their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that the course ought not, in any case, to be followed, unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence upon which they are asked to decide establishes beyond doubt that the facts, if fully investigated, would have supported the new plea. [emphasis added]
[emphasis in original]
Reference may also be made to the decision of this court in 
Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd
 
[2009] 2 SLR(R) 737
 at [46]–[54].
63     The issue in the present proceedings is one which this court is in just as advantageous a position as the court below to adjudicate upon. No new evidence is required to be adduced. The issue turns simply upon an interpretation of the legal effect of the relevant documents in their context – in particular, whether or not a fresh contract had been entered into by the parties. Indeed, as already mentioned earlier in this judgment, we also invited the parties to tender further submissions on this particular issue in order to ensure, beyond peradventure, that all the relevant arguments were before us.
Conclusion
64     In the circumstances, we are of the view that this court 
can
, in fact, consider what we consider to be the key or central issue in the present appeal, 
viz
, whether or not a fresh contract had been entered into by the parties. And it is to that particular issue that our attention now turns.
Was there a fresh contract entered into by the parties?
65     Turning, then, to the central issue in the present proceedings, one of the key documents is the 12 April Letter, which was sent by the Respondent to the Appellant and which reads as follows:
[note: 14]
12 April 2000
To: Ang Sin Hock [the Appellant]
Fm: Khoo Eng Lim [the Respondent]
Re: Sale of REDS Jewelry goods
Refer to your latest fax April 11.
There was 
a problem
 with the transfer 
and we are making alternative arrangement
. 
We will pick up a draft on Monday 17 April and will arrange to deliver to you on Tuesday 18 April
.
Again, we regret for [
sic
] the inconveniences [
sic
] caused.
Thank you.
[emphasis added]
66     In so far as the 12 April Letter itself is concerned, there was, in our view, a clear (and fresh) promise by the Respondent in that particular piece of correspondence to the Appellant to pay to the latter the amount of $270,725 owed (by way of a bank draft) which the former had originally undertaken to pay (see the Undertaking referred to earlier in this judgment (and reproduced above at 
[10]
)).
67     Whether or not the 12 April Letter was (as the Respondent argued) a counter-offer or (as the Appellant argued) an offer is, in our view, of little legal moment in so far as the present proceedings are concerned – not least because a counter-offer is, in effect, an offer which can either be accepted or rejected by the offeree concerned (here, the Appellant). It is clear that the Appellant, in fact, 
accepted
 the offer by the Respondent in the 12 April Letter (the core of which was the fresh promise by the Respondent to pay the Appellant the amount owed which the former had originally undertaken to pay to the latter in the Undertaking reproduced above at 
[10]
). In arriving at this conclusion, we are of the view that the Appellant had more than one legal string to his bow. Let us elaborate.
68     First, it could be argued that the Appellant had accepted the Respondent’s offer contained in the 12 April Letter by 
conduct
 (and see, generally, M P Furmston, 
Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract
 (Oxford University Press, 15th Ed, 2007) (“
Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston
”) at p 48 and Edwin Peel, 
Treitel: The Law of Contract
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) (“
Treitel
”) at para 2-017). The Appellant’s earlier fax dated 11 April 2000 (which was, in fact referred to in the 12 April Letter (see above at 
[65]
)) clearly evinced an intention on the part of the Appellant to commence legal proceedings against the Respondent (stating, in fact, a deadline of 14 April 2000 as the last date for an amicable settlement). The 12 April Letter was clearly intended by the Respondent to prevent the initiation of such proceedings. The Appellant, in fact, refrained from commencing legal proceedings based on the Respondent’s promise to pay contained in that same piece of correspondence. That this was, in fact, the case is evidenced by a further piece of correspondence from the Appellant to the Respondent dated 18 April 2000 (“the 18 April Letter”), which reads as follows:
[note: 15]
18 April 2000
To: Khoo Eng Lim [the Respondent]
Fm: Ang Sin Hock [the Appellant]
Re: Sale of REDS Jewelry goods
1.     Please refer to your fax 12.4.2000 re. the a/m subject, and as shown above.
2.     Please call me immediately to let me know how you are delivering the draft to me today.
Thank you.
69     Secondly, the letter just reproduced in the preceding paragraph (the 18 April Letter) is, in our view, 
itself
 a 
written acceptance
 of the offer contained in the 12 April Letter. Although the Appellant refers in para 3 of his letter of 19 April 2000
[note: 16]
 to the Respondent to the latter’s response to the effect that he (the Respondent) had not received the 18 April Letter, it was also clear from that particular paragraph (as well as the subsequent paragraphs) in that letter that the Appellant had, in fact, spoken to the Respondent that day (
viz
, 18 April 2000), and quite possibly even before that day as well. It is significant to note that there are no specific formalities and that, on any interpretation, the offer by the Respondent contained in the 12 April Letter had been accepted by the Appellant by 18 April 2000 at the very latest (if not earlier).
70     It is therefore clear that a valid (and fresh) contract had been entered into between the parties, pursuant to which the Respondent had promised to pay the requisite amount to the Appellant. However, the analysis thus far relates only to offer and acceptance. In order for a valid contract to have been concluded between the parties, the requirements of consideration 
as well as
 an intention to create legal relations also need to be satisfied (see also the decision of this court in 
Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal
 
[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332
 (“
Gay Choon Ing
”) at [46]–[72]). In our view, the latter requirement has been satisfied on the facts.
71     Turning to the (remaining) requirement of 
consideration
, it is also clear, in our view, that the Appellant had furnished sufficient consideration for the Respondent’s promise of payment in the 12 April Letter inasmuch there was forbearance by the former from commencing legal action against the latter during the period 12 April 2000 to 18 April 2000. It is established law that such forbearance constitutes sufficient consideration (see, for example, 
Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston
 at pp 107–110; 
Treitel
 at para 3-034; the Singapore High Court decisions of 
Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd v Wong Kin Heng
 
[1997] 1 SLR(R) 297
; 
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v Jurong Engineering Ltd and others
 
[2000] 1 SLR(R) 204
; and 
Malayan Banking Bhd v Lauw Wisanggeni
 
[2003] 4 SLR(R) 287
 as well as the decision of this court in 
Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent
 
[1994] 3 SLR(R) 250
). In any event, as the law now stands, it is not difficult to locate sufficient consideration in any given contract (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 1
 and the decision of this court in 
Gay Choon Ing
 (especially at [70], [96]–[97] and [100]–[110])).
72     In the circumstances, therefore, we find that the parties had entered into a fresh contract in which the Respondent expressly promised to pay the Appellant the sum concerned (
ie
, $270,725) in return for the Appellant’s forbearance not to commence legal action against the Respondent. The Respondent’s failure to deliver the bank draft to the Appellant on 18 April 2000 thus constituted a breach of contract, which entitled the Appellant to damages which would put him (the Appellant) in the same position as if the contract had been performed (see, for example, the seminal formulation by Parke B in the oft-cited English decision of 
Robinson v Harman
 (1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855). Such damages would constitute the amount which the Respondent had promised to pay. It is also clear, therefore, that the limitation period (of six years) under s 6(1)(
a
) of the Act 
vis-à-vis
 this particular contract would only commence from the time the contract concerned was breached (here, 18 April 2000). Given that the writ was issued on 17 April 2006, the Appellant’s claim based on this fresh contract was commenced within the limitation period and no issue of time-bar arises.
A coda on terminology and limitation
73     By way of a coda, we pause to observe that whilst such a contract might be termed a 
collateral
 contract inasmuch as it has some connection to the original contract between the parties, that is, in the final analysis, of no real practical significance. What 
is
 clear is that there arose, between the parties, a fresh (and independent) contract which (as we have already noted in the preceding paragraph) the Respondent had breached. That such a contract is not a collateral contract in its “typical” form is clear; in the words of a learned writer in the seminal article on collateral contracts, “in the 
typical
 collateral contract case, the consideration given for the promise is no more than the act of entering into the main contract” [emphasis in original] (see K W Wedderburn, “Collateral Contracts” [1959] CLJ 58 (“
Wedderburn
”) at p 79).
74     It has, however, been held that a collateral contract can be a basis for liability in and of itself (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of 
Heilbut, Symons & Co v Buckleton
 
[1913] AC 30
 as well as the English High Court decisions of 
Shanklin Pier Ld v Detel Products Ld
 
[1951] 2 KB 854
 and 
City and Westminster Properties (1934) Ltd v Mudd
 
[1958] 3 WLR 312
). Be that as it may, it might, nevertheless, still be argued that the factual situation in 
the present proceedings
 is somewhat different. Indeed, if one adopts a 
narrow
 conception of the concept of a collateral contract, it might be argued that the contract in the present proceedings is not a collateral contract inasmuch as it did 
not
 (unlike the contracts in question in the decisions just cited) arise 
prior to or contemporaneously with
 the main contract (and 
cf
 also, in this regard, the House of Lords decision of 
Clarke v The Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, The “Satanita”
 
[1897] AC 59
). However, as we have already noted in the preceding paragraph, this is of little legal moment in the present context as the crucial issue in the context of the present appeal is that there has been a fresh contract between the parties and that the breach of this contract entitles the Appellant to a remedy in damages.
75     However, 
even if
 this particular contract is, indeed, viewed as constituting a 
collateral
 contract, the main critique levelled against collateral contracts (to the effect that they generate commercial uncertainty) would 
not
 apply to the contract in these proceedings (the other common critique, it might be mentioned, centring on possible artificiality (and 
cf Gay Choon Ing
 (at [61])). However, such a contract 
would
 engender what is considered to be the key motif as well as (more importantly) advantage of collateral contracts generally, 
viz
, a substantively just and fair result (and see 
Wedderburn
 at pp 58 and 85). Indeed, the collateral contract has been used in a variety of different contexts in order to achieve a just and fair result. We have already noted one instance in the preceding paragraph. Taking yet another example, in the case of exception clauses, the collateral contract has been utilised to avoid the operation of such clauses (particularly where such clauses would operate unfairly against a contracting party, although there are, of course, other common law doctrines as well as a statute (
viz
, the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) which can also be utilised to like effect). Where a collateral contract exists, its terms and conditions may expressly override the exception clause in the main contract; in other words, the contracting party seeking to avoid the legal effect of the exception clause concerned would be relying upon the terms and conditions of 
a separate and independent contract
 altogether (and see, for example, the oft-cited English decisions of 
Couchman v Hill
 
[1947] 1 KB 554
; 
Mendelssohn v Normand Ltd
 
[1970] 1 QB 177
; and 
J Evans & Son (Portsmouth) Ltd v Andrea Merzario Ltd
 
[1976] 1 WLR 1078
). In yet 
another
 context – that of 
illegality and public policy
− a collateral contract can be utilised by a contracting party to avoid the otherwise harsh effects of a holding that a contract is void as being contrary to illegality and public policy (and see the seminal English Court of Appeal decision of 
Strongman (1945), Ltd v Sincock
 [1955] 3 All ER 90).
76     However, and on a more general level, one thing appears clear: A collateral contract 
can
 exist, 
even if
 a main transaction has 
not
 been entered into. Nevertheless, the 
contrary
 view was apparently expressed by this court in 
Hiap Huat Pottery (S) Pte Ltd v TV Media Pte Ltd
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 734
 (“
Hiap Huat Pottery
”) at [22]. However, this approach is, with respect, contrary to recent developments in other jurisdictions where a 
broader
 approach towards collateral contract has been adopted (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Blackpool and Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council
 
[1990] 1 WLR 1195
 (which was sought (unsuccessfully, with respect) to be distinguished in 
Hiap Huat Pottery
 at [29]−[32]) and the Federal Court of Australia decision of 
Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia
 (1997) 146 ALR 1), and may therefore need to be reconsidered and clarified should the issue arise directly for consideration in a future case. Indeed, it may be mentioned that the broader approach is more consistent with the 
spirit
 of the collateral contract whose ultimate aim is, as we have seen, to achieve a just and fair result in the case at hand. There is, admittedly, the danger of too much commercial uncertainty being generated. However, this danger can be met by the court requiring clear proof that the legal requirements of a binding contract have, indeed, been satisfied on the facts (see also below at 
[79]
−
[80]
), as well as (from an attitudinal perspective) being generally reluctant to find a collateral contract which ought to remain a finding of last resort.
77     As we have also noted, the fresh contract, as we have found on the facts of the present proceedings, does 
not
 fall within the ambit of s 6(1)(
a
) of the Act to begin with. On a related note, the main functions underlying statutes of limitation are well-summarised in the Report of the Law Reform Committee of England and Wales entitled 
Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury
 (Cmnd 1829, 1962), as follows (at para 17, which was also cited in the Report of the Law Reform Committee of England and Wales entitled 
Twenty-First Report (Final Report on Limitation of Actions)
 (Cmnd 6923, 1977) at para 1.7 (see also generally “The History and Policy of Limitation of Actions” in ch 1 of David W Oughton, John P Lowry & Robert M Merkin, 
Limitation of Actions
 (LLP, 1998))):
In considering what recommendations we should make ... we have constantly borne in mind what we conceive to be the accepted function of the law of limitation. In the first place, it is intended to protect defendants from being vexed by stale claims relating to long-past incidents about which their records may no longer be in existence and as to which their witnesses, even if they are still available, may well have no accurate recollection. Secondly, we apprehend that the law of limitation is designed to encourage plaintiffs not to go to sleep on their rights but to institute proceedings as soon as it is reasonably possible for them to do so. ... Thirdly, the law is intended to ensure that the person may with confidence feel that after a given time he may treat as being finally closed an incident which might have led to a claim against him.
78     Whilst bearing in mind the functions set out in the preceding paragraph, we observe that, even though there would (in the context of the present proceedings) otherwise have been a lapse of 
only five days
 beyond the six-year period prescribed by s 6(1)(
a
) of the Act (as the 12 April Letter also constituted an acknowledgment within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Act, with time running from 12 April 2000), the claim would nevertheless still be subject to the time-bar under s 6(1)(
a
) of the Act as the Appellant only commenced his action on 17 April 2006 (see also above at 
[15]
 and 
[50]
). While it would have been unfortunate if the Appellant’s claim had failed on this particular basis, the court would have had no alternative but to make such a determination. Even a delay of one day would not be a good reason to allow a claim offending the requisite limitation timeline to proceed. Sympathy for a claimant has no role to play when the issue is whether or not a particular limitation timeline has been offended. However, in this matter as a fresh contract was entered into between the Appellant and the Respondent, the difficulties arising from the application of the Act (in particular, s 6(1)(
a
) thereof) – and, indeed, the very issue of limitation itself – do not arise.
The importance of principle
79     We do emphasise, however, that our finding that there has been a fresh contract is a finding on 
the particular facts
 of the present proceedings and – to that extent – ought 
not
 to be viewed (as we emphasise once again in a moment) as a blanket precedent for the all-too-easy “construction” of contracts by way of a modern rendition of the unprincipled “principle” that is often embodied in the (derogatory) proverbial reference to justice as measured by “the length of the Chancellor’s foot”. This last-mentioned reference has, in fact, been attributed to the seventeenth century jurist, John Selden, who, in his 1689 work, 
Table-Talk 1689
 (Edward Arber ed) (Archibald Constable & Co Ltd, English Reprints, 1905), made the following observations (at p 46):
Equity is a Roguish thing, for Law we have a measure, know what to trust to, Equity is according to Conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity. ’Tis all one as if they should make the Standard for the measure, we call a Chancellors Foot, what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long Foot, another a short Foot, a third an indifferent Foot. ’Tis the same thing in the Chancellors Conscience.
80     In a related vein, and perhaps more importantly, our finding is 
also
 based on 
all the legal ingredients
 necessary to constitute 
a valid contract
. This is an important point because 
the relevant legal rules and principles – as applied, of course, to the specific facts −
 set the 
parameters
 as to whether or not 
a contract
 is formed in any given case; put simply, fresh contracts – and even collateral contracts, for that matter – cannot, as it were, be “conjured” out of “thin air”. Indeed, where the relevant legal criteria are 
not
 satisfied, the court concerned will certainly 
reject
 the argument in favour of a collateral (and/or fresh) contract in no uncertain terms (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of 
Lemon Grass Pte Ltd v Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd
 
[2002] 2 SLR(R) 50
). To adopt phrases coined by Denning LJ in a slightly different context, judges can be “bold spirits”, as opposed to “timorous souls” – but 
only
, we would reiterate, 
where there is a legal basis for such judicial boldness which would (in turn) aid in achieving a substantively just and fair result in the case at hand
. Both the aforementioned terms were, of course, coined by Denning LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co
 
[1951] 2 KB 164
 at 178. His powerful dissenting judgment (which the learned judge, significantly, refers to in an extralegal context as his “most important judgment” (see Lord Denning, “Foreword” to the inaugural volume of the 
Denning Law Journal
 at [1986] Denning LJ 1 at 1)) was, of course, ultimately vindicated by the House of Lords in the landmark decision of 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 (which first established liability in the English context for negligent misstatements).
81     Finally, as we have also noted, the fresh contract which we have found on the facts of the present proceedings does not −
unlike
 many collateral contracts – create commercial uncertainty. However, 
like
 most collateral contracts generally, it does aid in achieving a substantively just and fair result.
Conclusion
82     For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal with costs and with the usual consequential orders. Accordingly, we enter judgment for the sum of $270,725 in favour of the Appellant, together with interest at the rate of 3% per annum from the date of the writ, 
ie
, 17 April 2006, to date. However, having regard to the issues raised above, we are of the view that it would be appropriate to award the Appellant only half of his costs both here as well as in the court below.

12493,2766752,R v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1474,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: Christopher Anderson is being tried by jury for the murder of Allira Green. During the course of the trial, I have given a number of rulings, reserving my reasons so as not to detain the jury. This judgment states my reasons for giving those rulings.
	


Tendency evidence


	
	The Crown case is that the accused and the deceased were in a relationship and that the deceased was some 20 weeks pregnant as at the date of her death. Their relationship was volatile. There had been two previous occasions when the police had been called following verbal altercations. On the night of her death, the deceased was at the home of a friend, Louise Bodeker. A third woman, Allira Holt, had arrived to collect the deceased. The accused arrived after Allira Holt. The deceased and Allira Holt yelled at him to go away. According to the Crown case, the accused pushed his way into the unit and pushed all three girls over. Louise Bodeker says at that point the deceased went to the kitchen, took a large kitchen knife and ran at the accused, holding the knife above her head. Ms Bodeker saw the accused grab the deceased’s hand that was holding the knife. Neither Ms Bodeker nor Ms Holt saw what happened with the knife after that point. The deceased fell to the floor, having suffered a single fatal stab wound which had penetrated her lungs and heart. DNA of the accused was found on the handle of the knife.
	
	
	The trial was originally listed for hearing commencing on 18 May 2015. By notice dated 10 May 2015, the Crown gave notice of its intention to adduce evidence that the accused has a tendency to use serious physical violence towards his female partners. The notice attached a statement taken from a previous girlfriend of the accused. The statement was dated 7 July 2014 but had not previously been served on the accused. Since the date on which the tendency notice was served was a Sunday, it should (for practical purposes) be taken to have been served the following Monday, one week before the trial was due to commence. Owing to the need to address a number of pre-trial issues (including the late service of the tendency notice but also including several matters raised on behalf of the accused), the Crown and the accused joined in seeking an adjournment of the trial until 25 May 2015. The trial in fact commenced that day.
	
	
	The proposed tendency evidence was, in short, evidence of violence and serious assaults committed by the accused against his previous girlfriend. In an unusual and probably irrelevant coincidence, she also was pregnant at the relevant time. The evidence was governed by the tendency rule contained in s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), which provides:
	


97 The tendency rule

Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:

the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.


	
	The notice was served under cover of a letter foreshadowing an application under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act. That section confers power to make a direction that the tendency rule not apply to the evidence, despite the failure to give notice under s 97. The Crown’s letter proceeded on the misapprehension that there is a specific requirement to give 21 days’ notice of an intention to adduce tendency evidence. That is not the case. The content of the requirement is to give “reasonable notice”. Section 100(1) thus confers express power to direct that the tendency rule is not to apply despite a party’s failure to give reasonable notice. The breadth of such a power is to be understood in the context that it applies to civil proceedings as well as criminal proceedings.
	
	
	It should be noted that on a literal reading of s 100(1), the section appears to confer power to direct that the tendency rule is not to apply at all to particular evidence. The tendency rule has two limbs. In order to be admissible, tendency evidence must satisfy the “reasonable notice” requirement in s 97(1)(a) and the “significant probative value” requirement in s 97(1)(b). Section 100(1) is directed, in terms, at the tendency rule as a whole. It confers power to “direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 97”. The section thus purports to confer power to admit the evidence regardless of the requirement that it have significant probative value. However, I would regard that to be an unintended infelicity in the drafting of the statute. A direction under s 100(1) should, in my view, be made only to cure a failure to give notice and not to cure a failure of the evidence to meet the requirement of s 97(1)(b). That is consistent with the way in which the rule has been understood by the Court of Criminal Appeal: see R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [35] per Howie J; Santow JA and Bell J agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively.
	
	
	In criminal proceedings, apart from the tendency rule, there is an additional requirement which is that the Crown cannot use tendency evidence against a defendant “unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”: s 101 of the Act. However, the Court held in Harker that, although it might appear to be a “highly legalistic” exercise, the trial judge should not determine an application for a direction under s 100(1) by going directly to the issue whether the evidence would be inadmissible under that stricter requirement: at [36].
	
	
	The evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence in the present case is contained in paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the statement of the former girlfriend, as follows:
	


A few months after Chris and I had been in a relationship, Chris became verbally and physically abusive towards me. I remember the first occasion, Chris asked me to pick him up from Yarra Bay Sailing Club. When I arrived at Yarra Bay Sailing Club, Chris called me and told me he was at the Tattersalls Club in the city. I remember driving back into the city to pick Chris up. When I picked Chris up, he was verbally abusive towards me. I remember him spitting at me and going mental in the car. I was driving back through Redfern when Chris grabbed the steering wheel and tried to swerve the car into a building. This was the first occasion that I saw the violent side of Chris. On this occasion Chris jammed my hand in a door and pushed me again [sic] the kitchen bench and cupboard that was in our house at the time. I lost the baby at that stage due to him pushing me onto a sharp cupboard. The bay [sic] had been fine on the Monday as I had just had tests and the heart beat was missing after the incident. I was approx. 3-4 months pregnant at that stage, it was my 3rd scan and I had told all my friends and family. Also my hand was swollen (picture attached) and my back bruised all the way down. He punched holes in our bedroom cupboards again which had to be replaced a second time.

From this point on, Chris was aggressive and violent at least once every two (2) weeks. The first time Chris physically assaulted me was sometime around June 2010. I can’t recall what the argument was over but I recall Chris punched holes in the walls of our cupboards and doors having to be replaced by myself. Chris pushed me over and fell backwards over the lounge and onto the floor. Initially Chris was apologetic until about five minutes later when he pushed me over again and I felt [sic] backwards onto the ground. I did not report this incident to the police as Chris apologised and told me that he would never do it again.

On one occasion a month after the baby was killed Chris assaulted me to the point where I was unconscious and was taken to hospital where my brain swelled and my face was disfigured. I remember we were at home at the time, I was sitting at the dinner table and he became verbally abusive. Within minutes, Chris grabbed me by the pony tail and pulled me [sic] head down slamming it against the floor before continuing to assault me. As a result of this incident I was hospitalised overnight and then checkups on my brain and eye each few months for progress as my eye was damaged and unable to work for about three (3) months. I still have terrible headaches and loss of memory due to that incident and I am unable to maintain a [sic] intimate relationship due to the terror he has inflicted on me I get very nervous and cannot maintain the relationship due to fear.

On a separate occasion after I had kicked Chris out of my home as he had never paid rent, before he left he stole my credit card and took all my savings from my account and spent the money on drugs and drink. He then returned to my place of residence where he kicked my door in and yet against assaulted me. I called my father for help and he came and got me. All this time Chris was suppose [sic] to go to the rehab I would drop him off and he would, since I have now learnt, as soon as I drive off, leave and not attend.


	
	The Crown indicated that she did not propose to lead evidence as to the loss of the pregnancy, nor the fact that one of the assaults described by the witness resulted in a criminal charge.
	
	
	It was indicated on behalf of the accused that the principal issues in the trial would be whether the fatal stab wound was inflicted by a deliberate act of the accused (rather than accident) and whether the Crown can establish that any deliberate of stabbing the deceased was not done in self-defence.
	
	
	Taking the approach specified in Harker, I first considered whether I should make a direction under s 100(1) that the tendency rule not apply despite the failure to give notice under s 97. A direction under s 100(1) is one to which s 192 of the Evidence Act applies. That section provides:
	
	
	If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.
	
	
	Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:
	
	
	the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and
	
	
	the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and
	
	
	the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and
	
	
	the nature of the proceeding, and
	
	
	the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.
	
	
	In Harker, Howie J said that the two most important considerations in that case were the probative value of the evidence and any prejudice caused to the accused by the failure to give reasonable notice. In considering those issues in the present case, I had regard to the overriding duty of a trial judge to ensure that a person accused of a serious criminal offence has a fair trial. Without determining the issue raised by s 97(1)(b), I proceeded on the basis that the evidence would have some probative value.
	
	
	As already noted, the Crown was initially under the misapprehension that the requirement was to give 21 days’ notice. A shorter period could have been regarded as reasonable but the Crown acknowledged that the notice given on 10 May 2015 was not reasonable notice in the case of a trial then due to commence on 18 May 2015. However, the Crown submitted that the deferral of the trial by one week had adequately addressed any prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	I was not satisfied that it had. The postponement of the trial by one week was due to a combination of the late service of the tendency notice and other issues raised at the 11th hour on behalf of the accused. That meant that the accused had two weeks (rather than only one) to react to the notice. However, even leaving aside the need to prepare to deal with the tendency evidence at trial, there was a great deal for the accused’s legal team to be doing during that time. The matters to which the accused’s solicitor was attending included chasing up production of police notebooks and other documents that came into existence during the investigation through the issue of a number of subpoenas; negotiating with police (separately represented) in respect of the production of that material; investigating with a psychiatrist the possibility of a defence of substantial mental impairment; obtaining an expert report from a forensic pathologist and investigating the mental state of one of the two key eyewitnesses who had, until recently before the trial, been said to be “unavailable” but had become available and had provided a further statement.
	
	
	Some of those matters (particularly the position of the eyewitness) were not due to any delay on the part of the accused. Others were matters which could have been addressed more promptly by the accused but the simple fact is that, as events transpired, they were all tasks which had to be completed within the short time frame before the commencement of the trial so as to ensure a fair trial for the accused. The accused was (and remains) in custody, with all the practical impediments posed by that circumstance for the orderly taking of instructions.
	
	
	In those circumstances, even leaving aside my assessment as to the probative value of the evidence, I did not think it would be appropriate to relieve the Crown of the requirement to give reasonable notice of the tendency evidence. The admission of the evidence would have required the accused to answer for a range of incidents alleged to have occurred over a period of some months at least a year earlier. The investigation of those allegations and the process of taking instructions from the accused about them would have been a significant distraction to the accused and his legal team in the short period leading up to the trial, after the tendency notice was served. The inevitable prejudice was compounded by the fact that the accused’s legal team had never previously seen the statement of the tendency witness.
	
	
	In considering an application under s 100(1), the Court should give consideration to whether there is any way in which the evidence can be accommodated notwithstanding a lack of reasonable notice. The Crown did not submit that the trial date should be vacated to accommodate the evidence. I would not have acceded to any such application. The accused has been in custody since his arrest on 3 August 2013. Had the trial been postponed, he would have, in all likelihood, been in custody for a period approaching two years by the time of any further trial date.
	
	
	The Crown did submit that the evidence could be called later in the Crown case so as to give the accused’s legal team more time to prepare for it. In the circumstances of a criminal trial, I did not think it would be reasonable to regard the days of the trial as preparation time to accommodate a want of reasonable notice. For those reasons, I determined that the direction sought under s 100(1) of the Evidence Act should not be made.
	
	
	Even if reasonable notice had been given of the Crown’s intention to adduce the evidence or if the difficulty could have been accommodated in some other way, I would not have admitted the evidence. The critical question is whether the relevant tendency is “a link in the process of proving that the person did in fact behave in the particular way on the occasion in question”: Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; 106 FCR 51 at [61] per Sackville J; Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreeing. The factual issue in the present case is whether, when the deceased went at the accused holding a knife above her shoulder, the accused grabbed the knife and, in a deliberate act, stabbed her with the intention of killing her or causing grievous bodily harm. It may be accepted that the proposed tendency evidence, if accepted, would establish a tendency on the part of the accused to use serious physical violence towards a particular previous female partner. Whether that would establish a tendency to use serious physical violence towards “his female partners” would require an assessment and comparison of the circumstances of the accused during each relationship and the circumstances of each relationship. It appeared likely that would ultimately invite comparison of the former girlfriend’s references to the accused’s failure to attend drug rehabilitation during that time with the evidence in the present trial as to any drug use by the accused.
	
	
	The events described by the former girlfriend are very different from the events described by the two eyewitnesses on the evening Allira Green died. The evidence would not have been admissible unless its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had on the accused: s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. Whilst I accept that the evidence would have had some probative value in assessing the likely conduct of the accused, I was not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence outlined in the Crown’s tendency notice substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.
	
	
	The content of the statement served in support of the tendency notice reveals an understandable degree of bitterness and acrimony on the part of the former girlfriend towards the accused. As already noted, it included the unusual and probably irrelevant coincidence that each woman was pregnant at the relevant time; a factor which could have incited strong feeling in some members of the jury. Although the Crown indicated that she would not lead all of the evidence set out in the tendency statement, I nonetheless concluded that the evidence was likely to portray the accused in a very negative light at an earlier period and so distract the jury from focused attention on the real issues in this trial; that is, the accused’s deliberation and state of mind in the very short period of time between when the deceased came at him holding a knife and when she suffered the fatal stab wound. Accordingly, even if reasonably notice had been given, I would have excluded the evidence on the grounds that it did not satisfy the test in s 101 of the Evidence Act.
	


Evidence of Nardia Simms-Green


	
	Nardia Simms-Green is the mother of the deceased. Mr Waterstreet objected to paragraphs 33 and 35 of her statement, as follows:
	


On the 26th June 2013, on my daughter Allira’s birthday, we had arranged to have dinner with all the family. Chris was not invited to this dinner as Allira had separated from him a few days prior. We all attended the Chinese restaurant in Matraville for dinner. After dinner Ty left with his girlfriend to go home. I took my mother and Aunt home. I then dropped my son Lochlan and Allira to the Hoyts cinema at Eastgardens as Allira and her brother wanted to see a movie. I then went home after dropping them off. I gave them some money to get a taxi home as I would not be able to pick them up as I needed to take my medication once I was home for my kidney.

…

It was Chris. Allira had just opened her door of the car and Chris, with a look on his face that I can’t even explain asked how our evening went, he then laughed. Allira exited the car and straight away went off at Chris telling him to leave her alone and to go away. Crhis then became abusive towards us all saying things like, see, see how she goes on. I then got out of the car and went off at him also to leave my daigher alone and that she doesn’t need him in her life. Chris became this person who became more and more aggressive to the point he was rambling on and on. He started to froth at the mouth and his face was distorted. I became scared for Allira, Lochlan and myself. I told him to leave as I was ringing the Police. He moved about 120 metres up the road but still continued to yell abuse even while I was on the phone to 000. I was screaming over the phone for the police to please hurry up as he was out of control and I didn’t know what he would do next. He had no fear of the Police and said to me, “Ring your mates in blue, they have to catch me first”


	
	The Crown indicated that she did not wish to adduce all of the detail of that night but did wish to adduce evidence of the conflict and the description of the behaviour of the accused which prompted Ms Simms Green to call police.
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet’s objection raised two issues: first, he stated that the accused was in possession of a COPS computer entry which did not record any of the description now given by the mother and which stated “the victim did not disclose any offence and did not express fears for her safety”. On that basis, he submitted that the mother’s evidence was out of context and therefore prejudicial. I did not think the fact that there was additional evidence that could be lead from police in respect of the incident informed the admissibility of the mother’s evidence as to that incident.
	
	
	Separately, Mr Waterstreet objected that it would be unfair to admit the evidence since the incident the occurred some time before the stabbing (about five weeks). Mr Waterstreet accepted that “proper background relationship evidence” of the volatile relationship between the accused and the deceased would be admissible.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Waterstreet objected to the description of the accused “frothing” at the mouth. He submitted that the description portrayed mental illness or intoxication and was more prejudicial than probative.
	
	
	The description of the accused “frothing” at the mouth was no more than the mother’s description of what she saw. I determined to allow the Crown to adduce evidence as to what the mother saw and heard on that occasion. I do not think the description was prejudicial in the proper understanding of that term. On the premise (accepted by Mr Waterstreet) that evidence of the volatility of the relationship is relevant to the assessment of the events of 3 August 2013, I was satisfied that the evidence was relevant and admissible. I was not persuaded that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	


Evidence of Aaron Timbery


	
	The Crown tried to lead evidence from Aaron Timbery. Mr Timbery made a statement to police on 11 August 2013 which included an account of a conversation he had with the accused shortly after Allira Green was stabbed and observations he made of the accused’s clothing. Of particular importance to the Crown was the information he provided to police as to the conversation, as follows:
	


I stood up and Nudgie [the accused] came up to me. Nudgie said “I got set up. I went to see Allira and Allira came running around the corner with a knife. I grabbed her arm and twisted it and I don't know if the knife stabbed her but it could've.”

I said, “What are you talking about? I thought you were coming just to meet me.” Nudgie said, ""I had a fight with a bloke before that and I rang Allira and met her and that happened.”

I could see Nudgie was off his head on something. It looked like he was on drugs or something. Nudgie looked kind of drunk or something. Nudgie was acting different to usual. It looked like his adrenalin was pumping because he was very alert and aggressive. I said. “Are you drunk or something?” Nudgie said, “No I don't drink. I've had some Xanax and some ice.”


	
	When Mr Timbery was called in the trial (T100), he claimed to have no recollection of seeing the accused on 2 or 3 August 2013. He also claimed to have no recollection of making a statement to police on 11 August 2013. He said he had no independent recollection as to what happened on 3 August 2013, the day on which he heard about the death of Allira Green. His explanation was that he was heavily affected by drugs at that time.
	
	
	In the absence of the jury, I granted leave under s 32 of the Evidence Act for the witness to revive his memory in court by reference to his statement. The witness read the whole of the statement (T108.9). He said that, when he made the statement, he was telling the truth. However, he said that reading the statement had not refreshed his memory of the events to which it referred (T109.10).
	
	
	Before that point was reached, Mr Waterstreet had foreshadowed an objection to the alleged admission by the accused to taking Xanax and ice on the night of the stabbing. He submitted that admission of that evidence would be unfair, relying on s 90 of the Evidence Act. In the absence of the jury, I allowed Mr Waterstreet to cross-examine Mr Timbery on the voir dire on that issue. The effect of the evidence on the voir dire was that Mr Timbery was taking a great deal of ice during that period of his life and that he presently had no independent recollection whatsoever of that period. He was asked whether he felt he was compelled to go to the police station to make his statement. He said that he did not; his aunt had asked him to go to the police.
	
	
	During the cross-examination, I indicated that I had reached the point of wanting to hear from the Crown as to the admissibility of the alleged admission under s 90 (T114.18). The Crown then called (on the voir dire) the police officer who took the statement from Mr Timbery, Senior Constable Lucinda Vasey. She said that Mr Timbery attended Maroubra Police Station and told her that he wanted to give a statement about the murder of Allira Green; that he told her clearly what had happened so far as he knew; that he was awake the whole time and understandable and that his voice was clear; and that he was confident (T118).
	
	
	Upon reflection, I determined that there was nothing in the content of Mr Timbery’s statement (and nothing in the evidence of Senior Constable Vasey) to support the contention that the admission made by the accused to Mr Timbery was unfairly obtained so as to render the admission inadmissible under s 90. That section is concerned with the fairness to the accused of using evidence of an admission having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made. Nothing in the evidence on the voir dire suggested any unfairness on that account. The admission was, in effect, volunteered by the accused. The real issue raised by Mr Timbery’s evidence in the trial and on the voir dire was Mr Timbery’s reliability as a witness. That was an issue which would not need to be addressed unless and until he came up to proof as to the content of his statement.
	
	
	The following morning, I reminded Mr Waterstreet that I had stopped his cross-examination on the question of unfairness and s 90. No application was made at that point to cross-examine the witness further on that issue. I determined that the evidence was not inadmissible under s 90.
	
	
	However, at that point it appeared likely that if the Crown were allowed under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine the witness, he would maintain that, as at the time of giving evidence in the trial, he had no recollection of the events of 3 August 2013 or of giving his statement to police on 11 August 2013. In that circumstance, I considered it would be prudent to allow the Crown to cross-examine the witness in the absence of the jury so as to ascertain what he would say. I had in mind that if the witness gave no evidence confirming the events described in the statement, his previous representations to police would not be admissible as to the truth of their contents and accordingly that the jury should not hear the evidence at all. The out of court statement made by Mr Timbery to police could only be admissible as to the truth of its contents under s 66 of the Evidence Act but fell within the exclusion under s 66(3) and so was not admissible under that section.
	
	
	Under cross-examination by the Crown, Mr Timbery accepted that he had said the words recorded in the critical parts of his statement to police and said what he told police was the truth (T177 to 180). Under cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet, Mr Timbery was asked whether he now has any memory of what is contained in each paragraph. He said “no I didn’t remember until I read this” (T182).
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet asked “so when you told the Crown today that you intended to tell the truth in relation to what is contained in the document do you have any idea today whether it is the truth?”. Mr Timbery responded “no I don’t” (T183.14). Pressed as to whether, on the day on which he gave his statement, he recalled the events set out in the statement he said, “yes, well I wouldn’t have just said that”. He confirmed that what was recorded in paragraph 16 was from his memory on the day on which his statement was made (T184.40).
	
	
	Having heard the cross-examination on the voir dire, I did not accept Mr Timbery’s claim that he could not recall the events in question. I was satisfied he was not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence about those matters. On that basis, I granted leave to the Crown under s 38(1)(b) of the Evidence Act to question the witness in the trial as though she were cross-examining him.
	
	
	Mr Timbery repeated in the presence of the jury that he had said to police the things recorded in his statement and that he was telling the truth when he told the police those matters. As to the conversation recorded in paragraph 17 (the admission as to the use of Xanax and ice), however, he added “I don’t remember now but” (T191.33). In cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet in the trial, Mr Timbery repeated that he was taking ice at the time of the events dealt with in his statement to police and also at the time he made that statement. He said that he was taking quite a deal of ice at that time and that it had affected his memory.
	
	
	Since Mr Timbery accepted that the statements put to him in questions by the Crown were true, the net result was that there was oral evidence in the trial of those matters. However, I formed the view that (subject to any submission to the contrary on behalf of the accused) it would be appropriate to warn the jury as to the potential unreliability of that evidence having regard to the witness’s further evidence that he does not presently have any recollection of the events addressed in his statement owing to his use of drugs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Accused charged with conspiring
to traffic in MDA, trafficking in MDA and having MDA in possession for purpose
of trafficking—Appeal by Crown against acquittals on first and third counts and
appeal by accused against conviction on second count—Conspiracy appeal
dismissed—Conviction of accused set aside and acquittal entered because
evidence disclosed accused trafficked in salt of MDA but not in MDA itself—Application
to amend third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for purpose of
trafficking—Amendment allowed and new trial ordered on third count as
amended—Whether Court of Appeal erred in amending third count—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 529, 610, 613(8).

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA); (2) trafficking in MDA, and
(3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of trafficking. They were both
acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant alone was convicted on the
second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently acquitted on the third
charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the acquittal being based
on the application by the trial judge of res judicata and of the
principle in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.
Proceedings against his co-accused on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed. On the appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA, the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the

[Page 394]

appellant with trafficking in a specific
drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an essential element of the offence. The Court
rejected the contention that the relevant provisions of the statute, the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, listing among the restricted
drugs “MDA or any salt thereof” embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that
specified MDA only. McIntyre J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court,
considered that an amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the
appeal, would have been appropriate. However, an amendment was not sought and
the Court decided that an acquittal had to be entered.

When the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of
the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose of trafficking
came on for hearing the Court was differently constituted. The Crown, on the
appeal, applied to amend the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA
for the purpose of trafficking. The Court allowed the amendment, allowed the
Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and directed a new trial on the third
count as amended. From that judgment the appellant appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The only issue before this
Court on the present appeal was whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers
when it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform
to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that
count as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having
regard to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, it could not be suggested
that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that salt was not
mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was being charged
with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

In directing a new trial, MacLean J.A.
incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt that the
ends of justice required him to do. In granting this order the Court of Appeal
was acting pursuant to the provisions of s. 613(4)(b) and (8) of
the Criminal Code. The appellant’s contention that the order for a new
trial could not have been made unless the amendment had been granted and that
the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to the exercise of

[Page 395]

the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i),
but rather that it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial, was not
accepted. When Parliament authorized the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of
its power, to order a new trial, to “make any order, in addition, which justice
requires” it must be taken as having authorized that Court under those
circumstances to make any additional order which the ends of justice
require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the additional
order or not.

Since, in view of the evidence, the ends of
justice required the amendment which was here granted, it followed that it was
unnecessary to express any view as to the submission that the authority of the Court
of Appeal to grant an amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3) of
the Code which authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be
exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”.

As to s. 529 of the Code, which
bears the heading “Amending defective indictment or count”, the only mandatory
language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which provides for “an
objection to an indictment or to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent
on the face thereof” and requires such objection to be taken before plea or
thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case there was no
defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly had no application to the present circumstances.
There was no other language in the section which could be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8) which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: Three issues were
raised by the order of the Court of Appeal in this case: (i) whether a Court of
Appeal has power to amend an indictment; (ii) if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and (iii) whether
a Court of Appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. There was nothing in the case law, and
certainly nothing in the applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal
to do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did in this case, namely,
substitute a charge of a different offence, something which the trial judge
himself could not do under the wide amending powers given to him under
s. 529 of the Criminal Code.

The view that s. 610(3) of the Code confers
power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment could not be accepted. That
section takes its context from the preceding provisions of s. 610
which concern evidentiary

[Page 396]

questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “a court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

As to s. 613(8), the provision for “any
order, in addition, that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the
power to order a new trial under s. 613(4). It does not enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to s. 605(1)(a)
upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an acquittal. Assuming,
however, that s. 613(8) gives a court of appeal a wider power than that
which its terms appear to confer when considered alongside s. 613(4) and
s. 605(1)(a), the relevant question here was whether the
words “make any order, in addition, that justice requires” empower the Court of
Appeal to direct a new trial on a different offence from that on which the
appeal was taken.

There was here a usurpation of the function
of the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the
existing charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the
Court felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court
to take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia granting leave to amend the indictment and allowing the
Crown’s appeal against the appellant’s acquittal, and ordering a new trial on
the indictment as amended, on a charge of unlawfully having in his possession a
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal dismissed, the Chief
Justice, Spence, and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

[Page 397]

S.M. Froomkin, Q.C., and R. Leclaire, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This case
raises an important issue in the administration of the criminal law. The issue,
briefly stated, is whether a court, in particular an appellate court, has the
power to raise a charge against an accused and to direct that he be tried on
that charge, not being the one laid or sought to be laid by the Crown and not
being an included offence in that respect. I should have thought that the
answer must be emphatically “no”, but the British
 Columbia Court of Appeal resolved the issue in the
affirmative under what, in my view, was a misconception of the problem that it
faced. A recital of the facts makes this clear.

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine, more conveniently called MDA; (2)
trafficking in MDA, and (3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of
trafficking. They were both acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant
alone was convicted on the second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently
acquitted on the third charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the
acquittal being based on an application by the trial judge of res judicata and
of the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen[1]. Proceedings against his co-accused
on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on November 26,
1975, and is of no concern here. The appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA was heard on February 4 to 6, 1976, by a Bench composed of Maclean, Seaton and

[Page 398]

McIntyre JJ.A. The latter delivered the
principal judgment of the Court[2] on
March 26, 1976, whereby the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the
appellant with trafficking in a specific drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an
essential element of the offence. The Court rejected the contention that the
relevant provisions of the statute, the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. F-27, listing among the restricted drugs “MDA or any salt thereof”,
embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that specified MDA only. In its opinion,
the trial judge had erred in making interchangeable references to MDA and salt
of MDA.

McIntyre J.A. concluded his reasons for judgment
as follows:

This is a case where in my view an
amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the appeal, would have
been appropriate. Had the Crown sought an amendment I would have been disposed
to allow it. However, no application having been made I feel obliged for the
reasons given above to consider that this appeal should be allowed and an
acquittal entered.

Seaton J.A., who wrote brief concurring reasons,
noted that although the expert evidence was to the effect that MDA and salt of
MDA were the same drug, a view accepted by the trial judge, the question was
one of law turning on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Food
and Drugs Act, and particularly Schedule H. Under the Act they were not the
same drug, and since the Crown did not seek an amendment, an acquittal had to
be entered.

The issue now before this Court arises from the
disposition by the British Columbia Court of Appeal of the Crown’s appeal
against the acquittal of the appellant on the third count, namely, possession
for the purpose of trafficking. In approaching

[Page 399]

the issue, I take no position on the correctness
of the decision of the Court of Appeal that the Narcotic Control Act created
two distinct offences, one relating to MDA and the other to a salt of MDA. That
differentiation must stand for present purposes. The appeal by the Crown from
the acquittal of the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose
of trafficking came on for hearing on May 12, 1976, some six weeks after the
provincial Court of Appeal had disposed of the appellant’s appeal on the second
count favourably to him. The Court was differently constituted, consisting of
Maclean, McFarlane and Branca JJ.A. The Crown, on the appeal, applied to
“amend” the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for the purpose
of trafficking. In short reasons with which the other members of the Court agreed,
Maclean J.A. allowed the “amendment”, allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the
acquittal and directed a new trial on the third count as amended. He said only
this:

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

It is thus clear that judges of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal who made up the different Benches that heard the
appeals on the second and third counts were in no doubt of the Court’s power to
“amend” an indictment so as to charge a different offence from the one on which
the accused was tried. This is not the view of my brother Ritchie, whose
reasons in this appeal I have had the advantage of reading, because he speaks
not of an “amendment” to charge a different offence but of an amendment “to
conform to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in
[the third] count as originally drawn”. Since for the purposes of this case, as
I have already noted, it must be taken that the specification of a particular
drug in the charge made proof thereof an essential element of the offence, the
substitution in the wording of the charge of another drug amounts to a charge
of a different offence, even though the other essential elements, namely,
possession for the purpose of

[Page 400]

trafficking, are the same in either situation.
Indeed, counsel for the Crown conceded that in this case he must accept as a
fact that different offences were involved in the indictment as laid and as
altered by the Court of Appeal.

Does then a court of appeal have the power to
order an accused to be retried on a different charge from that originally laid
and different from that on which he was originally tried? It is one thing to
amend, so as to rectify an imperfect charge or indictment of an offence where
the charge or indictment is not itself a nullity; it is another thing to
substitute a charge of a different offence. Supplying an omitted essential
averment of a charge which is clearly indicated is one thing; changing a charge
to allege a different offence is something else.

II

Three issues are raised by the order of the
court of appeal in the present case. They are, first, whether a court of appeal
has power to amend an indictment; second, if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and third, whether
a court of appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. I think it relevant to these issues to
begin with a consideration of the powers of a trial judge to amend an
indictment.

Those powers are now set out in s. 529 of
the Criminal Code. It is unnecessary in this case to trace its history,
other than to note that it goes back not only to the original Criminal Code of
1892 (see s. 723) but beyond that Code to the Criminal Procedure
Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 29, s. 70. Although there was originally
some doubt whether the power to amend extended beyond the amendment of formal
defects, statutory clarification and ensuing judicial decisions settled that
question in favour of an extended power, including a power to supply an
essential averment of the offence charged as well as power to make changes in
the assertions of the charge to conform with the evi-

[Page 401]

dence as to any such details: see R. v.
Lacelle[3]; R.
v. Kerr[4];
Yanovitch v. The Queen[5]. Wide
as was the power to amend reposed in the trial judge, it did not extend to
authorize him to substitute an offence different from the one charged. This was
asserted more than fifty years ago in the Kerr case, supra, at
p. 231, where Meredith C.J.O. said, referring to the provision for
amendment of an indictment that “[it] does not, of course, authorize an
amendment which substitutes a different offence for that intended to be charged
or the addition of other offences”. The same view was taken more recently by
the Quebec Court of Appeal in Dupont v. The Queen[6], at p. 390, and re-affirmed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Elliott[7], at p. 237. An earlier
authority to the same effect is R. v. Cohen[8].

I am not unmindful of s. 496 of the Criminal
Code which relates to the preferring of an indictment by the Crown and to
the inclusion of counts of offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, even if the accused was not committed for trial thereon.
Although this provision does not touch the powers of the trial judge, it
indicates that it is left to the prosecution to determine, in the defined
circumstances, whether to add or substitute a charge other than that set out in
the information. The farthest that the courts have gone in respect of the
substitution of offences is to permit the Crown to ask for an amendment to that
effect of an information upon which an accused has elected trial before a
magistrate but in such case the accused must be allowed to re-elect: see R.
v. Hollman[9]. I
do not pass on the correctness of this view of a court’s power. The substance
of the matter appears to be a withdrawal of one information by the Crown and
the laying of another, and

[Page 402]

this is open to the Crown in respect of
indictments.

Coming then to the powers of a court of appeal
in respect of amendments or substitutions, I find no provision of the Criminal
Code which gives a court of appeal greater powers in these respects than
are given to a trial judge; and, indeed, there is no provision which expressly
gives any power relating to indictments to a court of appeal. Neither Bench of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal discussed or even referred to any
provision of the Criminal Code which supported the power it asserted,
but during the argument before this Court ss. 610 and 613(8) as well as
s. 529 were brought to the fore.

I shall deal first with s. 610 which reads
as follows:

610. (1) For
the purposes of an appeal under this Part the court of appeal may, where it
considers it in the interests of justice,

(a) order the production of
any writing, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings;

(b) order any witness who
would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was
called at the trial,

(i) to attend and be examined before the
court of appeal, or

(ii) to be examined in the manner provided
by rules of court before a judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer
of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the
court of appeal for the purpose;

(c) admit, as evidence, an
examination that is taken Under subparagraph (b)(ii);

(d) receive the evidence, if
tendered, of any witness, including the appellant, who is a competent but not
compellable witness;

(e) order that any question
arising on the appeal that

(i) involves prolonged examination of
writings or accounts, or scientific or local investigation, and

(ii) cannot in the opinion of the court of
appeal conveniently be inquired into before the court of appeal,

be referred for inquiry and report, in the
manner provided by rules of court, to a special commissioner appointed by the
court of appeal; and

[Page 403]

f) act upon
the report of a commissioner who is appointed under paragraph (e) in so
far as/the court of appeal thinks fit to do so.

(2) In proceedings under this
section the parties or their counsel are entitled to examine or
cross-examine witnesses and, in an inquiry under paragraph (1)(e), are
entitled to be present during the inquiry and to adduce evidence and to be
heard.

(3) A court of appeal may exercise in
relation to proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in
subsection (1) that may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil
matters, and may issue any process that is necessary to enforce the orders or
sentences of the court but no costs shall be allowed to the appellant or
respondent on the hearing and determination of an appeal or on any proceedings
preliminary or incidental thereto.

(4) Any process that is issued by the court
of appeal under this section may be executed anywhere in Canada.

Although I have reproduced the entire
section for context, the only terms thereof relevant here are the opening
words of subs. (3), namely “A court of appeal may exercise in relation to
proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that
may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”. Section 610 first
appeared as s. 1021(1) of the Criminal Code, enacted by 1923
(Can.), c. 41, s. 9, and was taken from s. 9 of the English
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23. The concern of the English
Courts with this provision does not appear to have gone beyond reliance on it
to permit fresh evidence to be admitted on appeal: see R. v. Robinson[10]. A similar provision was at issue
in the New South Wales case of R. v. Burns[11] to support the power of an appellate court
to amend an indictment. In that case an indictment charged the accused with
obtaining a travel document by a false pretence to one N with intent to
defraud, but the evidence did not show a false pretence to N but rather to
another, and it was held that the provision was not ample enough to empower an
appellate court to make the amendment. Although dissenting on the ground that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the conviction of
the accused, Chief

[Page 404]

Justice Cullen was nonetheless of the same
opinion as his colleagues in declaring that the provision comparable to our now
s. 610(3) did not enable an appellate court to make an amendment to an
indictment which had been finally dealt with by the trial judge; and he added
(at p. 356): “so drastic a power, if it had been the intention of the
Legislature to confer it, one would expect to have seen expressed in plain
words”.

Section 610(3) was considered in a series of
British Columbia cases, which I wish to examine. R. v. Danyleyko[12] may be put to one side because
there the British Columbia Court of Appeal sitting as the Yukon Territory Court
of Appeal relied on s. 610(3) and on the provincial Court of Appeal Act
to support its right to send a stated case back to a magistrate for
amendment; it does not, therefore, touch the issue in question here. In R. v.
McNutt[13], an
issue arose as to proof of the territorial jurisdiction of a magistrate under
an indictment charging an assault in place H whereas it occurred in place W,
both being within the territorial jurisdiction. No amendment was made or sought
before the magistrate. A new trial was ordered by the majority in view of the
course of the proceedings below (the dissenting judge concluded that
territorial jurisdiction had not been proved) but Davey J.A. in obiter also
adverted to what is now s. 610(3) as being broad enough to empower the
Court of Appeal to make an amendment to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This
statement was induced, however, by doubt whether the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was right in an earlier case, R. v. More and Melville[14] (Davey J.A. being a member of the
Court), which held that an allegation of the commission of an offence at a
defined place was an essential averment, and where the evidence showed its
commission at a different place and no amendment was made at trial, the Court
of Appeal could not itself amend but must quash the conviction. However, it was
held that it was open to the Court to order a new

[Page 405]

trial in the interests of justice, and it would
be for the trial judge to decide whether an amendment was necessary and, if so,
whether it should be made. In the McNutt case, Wilson J.A. was content
to apply the More and Melville case in this respect while also agreeing
with Davey J.A. that a new trial was warranted in McNutt because of the
course of proceedings there.

Among the authorities relied on in the More
and Melville case was R. v. Austin[15]
where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that on a charge of robbing a named
person, proof that the person robbed was the one named was essential, and in
the absence of an amendment at trial to make the indictment conform to the
evidence the Court of Appeal could not remedy the defect because it had no
power to amend, and consequently an acquittal must be entered. There was no
such additional ground in the Austin case as there was in the More
and Melville case to warrant a new trial; there was simply failure of proof
at trial of an essential averment, and the Court of Appeal did not think it
should enter the lists and do for the Crown what it was open to it to do and
what it failed to do for itself, namely, seek an amendment at trial.

This brings me to the later judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt[16], in which the force of R. v.
More and Melville was eroded and in which the majority of the five-man
Bench concluded that (to use the words of Davey J.A. at p. 39) “this Court
may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of amendment conferred by the Code
upon trial Judges” but it was a power to be exercised with greatest care.
Davey J.A. did not himself indicate the provisions of the Criminal Code giving
this asserted power to a court of appeal. It is clear from his words that he
was purporting to exercise the

[Page 406]

powers of a trial court under what is now
s. 529. At the same time, he based his conclusion on adoption of the
reasons of Wilson J.A. who invoked what is now s. 610(3), pointing out
that there was no reference to that provision in the More and Melville case,
and holding that s. 529 did not extend to a court of appeal. I should say
at this point that the decision in Wixalbrown and Schmidt cannot be
justified by reliance on s. 529 which, by its own words, is restricted to
matters at trial. It is included in Part XVII of the Criminal Code—Procedure
by Indictment—while the powers of the Court of Appeal are set out in Part
XVIII—Appeals—Indictable Offences—and there is no incorporating reference.

What Davey J.A. said on the question of a court
of appeal’s power to amend, speaking also for Bird and Tysoe JJ.A., with
Sheppard J.A. dissenting on this point, was an alternative ground of decision,
having regard to the facts of the case. The two accused were charged with
breaking and entering certain premises at a specified time and committing an
indictable offence, to wit, theft. The charge was laid under what is now
s. 306(1)(b) (then s. 292(1)(b)) which concluded
with the word “therein” in defining the offence but that word was not included
in the indictment nor was objection taken to the omission at the trial which
proceeded on the basis that the alleged theft was committed in the specified
premises. The word “therein” had been included in the information upon which
the preliminary inquiry was conducted which resulted in the committal for
trial. On appeal from conviction, counsel for the accused took for the first
time two objections; first, that there were no or no sufficient particulars of
the alleged offence of theft, as was a requisite under s. 492, (now
s. 510) and, second, that the omission of the word “therein” was an
omission of an essential averment and hence the accused was convicted of an
offence not known to the law.

Davey J.A. disposed of the first objection by
agreeing that if theft alone had been charged the indictment would have been
fatally defective (rely-

[Page 407]

ing on Brodie v. The King[17], at p. 199), but theft being
alleged as part of a compound offence and there being sufficient particularity
to enable the accused to meet the charge, the objection failed. As to the
second objection, the omission of the word “therein” from the indictment, Davey
J.A. took alternative positions. He held, first, that as a matter of context
(purporting to distinguish this Court’s judgment in McNeil v. The
King[18], with,
in my opinion, questionable success) there was not an omission of an essential
averment but rather an imperfect allegation of such an averment which caused no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. His alternative position, agreeing
for this purpose that there was omission of an essential averment, was that in
principle (to quote him, at p. 39),

…no person ought to stand convicted or be
imprisoned on a charge that totally omits an essential averment required to
constitute an offence known to the law. That in itself is a substantial wrong.
I can see no difference in principle between a conviction for a charge that
lacks one averment necessary to constitute a crime, and a conviction for one
that is totally unknown to the law. To allow the former to stand would open the
door to grave abuses, the end of which cannot be foreseen.

He went on to say, however, that “that objection
can be met by amendment if we have the power”. He concluded, as I have already
noted, that a court of appeal “may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of
amendment conferred by the Code upon trial Judges”. He did not say whence
comes this power—it could only be given by statute—and I can only infer from
Davey J.A.’s reliance on Wilson J.A.’s reasons that in Davey J.A.’s view it
derived from what is now s. 610(3) of the Criminal Code. However,
s. 610(3) speaks of the power of a court of appeal in civil matters and it
is impossible to find authorization in it for the exercise of powers conferred
by the Criminal Code upon trial judges.

[Page 408]

Sheppard J.A. met the issue of the omission of
an essential averment, to which no objection was taken at trial, by invoking
the principle laid down in R. v. Leclair[19], namely, that when an accused has
failed to move to quash before pleading to an indictment and has failed as well
to object during the trial, the Court of Appeal may refuse to allow him to
raise the matter there unless it is of opinion that the accused has been in
some way prejudiced or misled. In Leclair, although an essential
averment was omitted, the section of the Code under which the
offence was charged was referred to, and this, it seems to me, must have some
bearing on the statement of principle which, otherwise, would appear to
contradict Davey J.A.’s opinion, quoted above, that omission of an essential
averment itself is a substantial wrong. I do not need, however, to dwell on
this point here but pass to Sheppard J.A.’s observation on whether there is a
power in a court of appeal to amend an indictment. He said this on the point
(at p. 44):

The Court of Appeal has not power to make
the amendment of the indictment and conviction by adding the word “therein” as
requested by the Crown. By reason that Parliament has expressly conferred on
the trial Court the power to amend indictments subject to certain restrictions
(s. 510) [now s. 529] there is difficulty in construing other
sections of the Code as impliedly conferring upon another Court,
such as the Court of Appeal, the power to amend the indictment and conviction,
either subject to the same restrictions on the trial Court or without any
restriction. Moreover, the primary question for the Court of Appeal is whether
or riot substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred (s. 592(1)(b)(iii))
[now s. 613(1)(b)(iii)]; if not the appeal would be dismissed and
the matter thereby ended. If substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred the appeal would be allowed and the conviction quashed, with the
direction of an acquittal, or of a new trial (s. 592(2)) [now s. 613(2)].
Only in the event of a new trial would any amendment be required and the power
to make such amendment has been given to the trial Court where the accused
would have an opportunity to plead thereto and to meet the issue raised
thereby. It would follow that the Court of Appeal has not the power to amend
the indictment and conviction as requested for the Crown.

[Page 409]

I have reviewed the Wixalbrown and Schmidt case
at some length because it has spawned other decisions to the same effect on the
power to amend. Certain observations must be made about it. In the first place,
and central to the present case, it does not deal with the substitution of a
charge of a different offence from that sought to be alleged. Second, Wilson
J.A. did not say what Davey J.A. said he did. Wilson J.A. noted that a court of
appeal could not found a power to amend an indictment on the now s. 529,
that provision being limited to trial judges, but it could be founded on the
now s. 610(3) as giving the same power to amend as the Court of Appeal had
in civil cases.

I am unable to accept the view that
s. 610(3) confers any power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment.
That subsection takes its context from the preceding provisions of
s. 610 which concern evidentiary questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “A court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Although Wilson J.A.
purported to find support for his view in this Court’s judgment in Kissick v.
The King[20], that
case was concerned with an issue as to admissibility of evidence and thus
related to the very subject-matter of s. 610. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

Wixalbrown and Schmidt was invoked by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Breland and George[21], where
essential averments were omitted from a charge but no objection was taken at
trial. The majority judgment proceeded on alternative bases, relying, first, on
the principle of R. v. Leclair, supra, that where no objection is taken
at trial the accused will not be allowed to take it on appeal unless he has
been misled or prejudiced; and, second, on the principle allegedly

[Page 410]

derived from the judgment of Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt that even if the accused has been misled or prejudiced, the
Court of Appeal may amend and affirm the conviction under s. 529 of the Criminal
Code if there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I
have doubts whether Wixalbrown and Schmidt goes this far (and the
dissenting judgment of Whittaker J.A. supports my doubt), since Davey J.A. was
mistaken as to what Wilson J.A. said in that case but, in any event, I need not
pursue this because we are not dealing in the Breland and George case
with the substitution of a different charge but only with the perfection of an
imperfect one.

There is another line of cases represented by Morin
and Morin v. The Queen[22] and
by R. v. Pearson[23] which
take a strict approach against the Crown where an essential particular of a
charge is not proved and no application to amend is made by the Crown to the
trial judge. In the Morin case, there was a charge of illegal possession
of goods on a stated date but the evidence showed possession at a later date.
The Crown did not move to amend but a conviction was entered at trial. The
Quebec Court of Appeal held that the offence charged was not proved and that it
had no power to rectify the matter, citing R. v. Volaine[24]. This class of case differs from
those where an essential averment or some particular is omitted; the charge is
good in all respects but, as in the Volaine case, it alleges an offence
committed on a specific date and the evidence does not show any of the
prohibited acts to have been committed on that date. No rectification having
been effected at the trial, it was held in Volaine that the Court of
Appeal had no power to rectify the mistake, with the result that a conviction
on the charge could not stand and an acquittal had to be ordered.

[Page 411]

In the Pearson case, supra, there
was a variance as to the place of commission of an offence between the
statement in the charge and the evidence that was adduced but no application
was made to amend. On appeal, a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal held
that the conviction must be quashed and an acquittal entered because the Court
of Appeal had no power to amend the charge to conform to the evidence. Owen
J.A. dissented in an extensive review of the authorities, preferring to follow
and to apply, in respect of a variance as to the place of commission of an
offence, a line of cases, having their source in English case law, holding that
a variance as to date was not fatal to a conviction because the place, like the
date, was not an essential averment, and since the accused was not misled or
prejudiced the conviction should stand. He added this (at p. 26):

In view of this conclusion, I do not deem
it necessary to discuss whether this Court, in the present case, had the power
to amend the indictment so as to conform with the proof.

One further point may be noted, arising from the
judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Christiansen[25]. That Court was unanimous in
holding that a charge of trafficking in narcotics by distributing was not
supported by the evidence and further that an attempt to commit the offence was
not established. However, it divided on the consequences of its holding. Since
it appeared that the evidence supported a finding of trafficking by giving, the
question was whether the trial judge should have amended the indictment suo
motu and whether, not having done so, this was a reversible error. Hughes
C.J.N.B. held on the authorities that there was no duty on the trial judge to
amend the indictment to conform to the evidence when the Crown did not seek an
amendment and hence would dismiss the Crown’s appeal against an acquittal. Ryan
J.A. was content to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the offence charged
was not proved. Only Limerick J.A., who dissented, viewed s. 610(3) as
giving the Court of Appeal power to amend the indictment

[Page 412]

but, apparently, only by reason of the trial
judge’s error in law in failing to make the amendment. It followed in his view
that a new trial should be directed on an amended indictment, invoking in this
respect s. 613(8) of the Criminal Code.

I cannot subscribe to Limerick J.A.’s
proposition that a trial judge has a duty to amend an indictment to conform to
the evidence when the Crown has not sought an amendment and hence the basis on
which he asserted an amending power in the Court of Appeal under s. 610(3)
disappears. Indeed, if he is correct in imposing such a duty on a trial judge
there is no need to invoke s. 610(3) since the issue then becomes merely
one of correcting an error of law below. I do not find the Christiansen case
of any assistance on the issues in the present case.

It is, of course, the fact that, with the power
given to a trial judge to amend to add an omitted essential averment, the line
between a charge which is a nullity and one which is merely imperfect has
become more difficult to draw. R. v. Hunt, Nadeau and Paquette[26] is an illustration, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal holding there that there was no offence disclosed in
the charge, which was thus not amendable. In R. v. Major[27], which came to this Court (see 27
C.C.C. (2d) 239) MacKeigan C.J.N.S. considered both R. v. Leclair and
R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt and, speaking for the majority, laid it
down (at p. 65) that “the omission of what used to be considered an
essential averment is not now sufficient to prevent a charge being cured by
amendment, even at the Court of Appeal level, so long as the accused is reasonably
informed and not misled, and especially where the offence is correctly
identified by section number”. The source of this power must have been
s. 529 because MacKeigan C.J.N.S. said that he respect-

[Page 413]

fully agreed with Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt.

The issue for MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in the Major
case was whether the charge was an unamendable nullity or was amendable
despite its imperfection, and he concluded that it was amendable by supplying
an omitted essential averment but that it was necessary to see if the matters
covered by the missing averment were in fact proved in order to decide whether
the amendment should be made and whether the accused should have been
convicted. It was on the point of whether there was such evidence that Cooper
J.A. dissented from the majority and would, unlike them, have allowed the
amendment and affirmed the conviction which the majority quashed. In so far as
the Nova Scotia Court’s decision in the Major case stands for the
proposition that a court of appeal may exercise the powers of a trial judge
under s. 529 to amend a charge of an indictable offence to supply an
essential averment it is, in my opinion, wrong in law and this is very clear
from a mere reading of s. 529. The appeal to this Court was disposed of in
short oral reasons at the conclusion of the hearing whereby Cooper J.A.’s
assessment was preferred and the conviction was accordingly restored: see
(1976), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 239.

The Major case was considered by this
Court in its recent decision in R. v. Côté[28], which was a Crown appeal from
acquittal on an information charging an offence under s. 235(2) of the Criminal
Code, the information referring to the section but omitting from the
particulars of the charge the words “without reasonable excuse”. No objection
was taken by the accused to the omission either at first instance or on the
trial de novo, nor did he object in his notice of appeal that the charge
did not disclose an offence. However, leave to amend the notice of appeal to
raise this objection was given by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal which, in
the result, quashed the summary conviction on that ground. The case was brought
here on

[Page 414]

the question of the applicability of ss. 732(1),
(3) and 755(4) (as it stood at that time) of the Criminal Code. Whether
s. 732, which refers to the powers and position of a summary conviction
court, has any relevance to an issue arising in an appellate court is, at best,
doubtful, and I have grave doubt as well whether s. 755(4) has any
application to a court of appeal since it is a provision referring to an
“appeal court” defined in s. 747 as being the court for trials de novo whereas
the further appeal to a court of appeal is dealt with in s. 771. However,
neither s. 732(1), (3) nor s. 755(4) was necessary to the
determination of the Crown’s appeal (which was allowed in this Court) since
both de Grandpré J. who wrote for the majority and Spence J. who wrote in
concurrence were agreed that the information was sufficient and did not need
amendment.

However, in deference to the arguments advanced
by counsel on the question on which leave was given to bring the case to this
Court, de Grandpré J. went on to discuss the Major case, pointing out
(and in this Spence J. agreed) that we were concerned, on the appeal here, only
with the question whether there was sufficient evidence to prove an element of
the offence charged, and we supported the dissenting view of Cooper J.A. in the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that there was such evidence. The further observation
and conclusion of de Grandpré J. on the effect of ss. 732(1), (3) and 755(4)
(and I have already indicated my doubt of their applicability to a court of
appeal) that “it was an error on the part of the [Saskatchewan] Court of Appeal
to fail to consider the application of the relevant provisions of s. 732
and s. 755… in the circumstances of the case and to hold that the
information did not disclose an offence known to the law” (at p. 358 of 33
C.C.C. (2d)) have no relevance for the issue under consideration in the present
case.

This observation and conclusion was prefaced by
the words (referring to the Major case) that “this recent decision of
our Court settles the matter with the result that the question of law defined
in the order granting leave [in the Côté case] must be

[Page 415]

answered in the affirmative”. Whatever be the
view taken of our decision in the Major case, nothing in it touches the
power of a court of appeal to substitute a charge of a different offence, and
it must be assumed that Chief Justice MacKeigan’s reference to the Court of
Appeal’s power to amend can only have been a reference to s. 529 although
no Criminal Code provision was identified by him.

Since it is established—and a recent
illustration is seen in R. v. Vallée[29]—that
a charge or an indictment which fails to disclose an offence, one which is a
nullity, is not amendable by the trial judge even given the wide powers of
amendment reposed in him by s. 529, and that no power to breathe life into
a nullity rests in a court of appeal, it would be astonishing if on appeal a
court of appeal could exercise power to substitute a different charge when a
trial judge cannot do so. There is no express power to do so, indeed there is
not even any express power in a court of appeal to amend, as there is in New
Zealand under s. 392(1) of the Crimes Act, 1908 (N.Z.), No. 32, and
it would seem that the proper course for the Court of Appeal to adopt, if it
decides to order a new trial and not apply the Leclair doctrine to
foreclose the accused on any objection to the indictment, is to leave it to the
trial judge to decide whether an amendment should be made.

III

I turn now to s. 613(8) of the Criminal
Code and, in order to provide a context for its consideration I reproduce
as well s. 613(4) as that provision stood at the time of the proceedings
in this case in the British Columbia Court of Appeal (it was amended and re‑arranged
by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93,
s. 75, effective July 26, 1976, but without any change in substance). The
two subsections read as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

[Page 416]

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make
any order, in addition, that justice requires.

I supplement these provisions to make the short
point here that this Court’s power to entertain the accused’s appeal from the
setting aside of his acquittal is found in s. 618(2)(a) which gives
him a right of appeal in such circumstances on a question of law, here the
question of the proper construction and application of s. 613(4), (8).

Grammatically and as a matter of common sense
construction, a court of appeal, seized of a Crown appeal against an acquittal,
looks to s. 613(4) for the powers it may exercise on such an appeal, and
it is only where (in the words of s. 613(8)) “a court of appeal exercises
any of the powers conferred by subsection… (4) [that] it may make any order, in
addition [to that exercise (the italicized words are my own)] that
justice requires”. The provision in s. 613(8) for “any order, in addition,
that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the power to order a
new trial under s. 613(4). It does not, in my view, enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is, I think, rather obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to
s. 605(1)(a) upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an
acquittal. There is a statutory framework, and only a statutory framework, for
appeals, and the limitations which have been placed by Parliament on Crown
appeals are clear. A court of appeal, limited to questions of law arising out
of the indictment on which an accused has been tried and acquitted, cannot, so
to speak, pull itself up by its own bootstraps to exercise its power to order a
new trial but must find a basis for doing so in respect of the charge as laid
and considered at trial. It is only that charge which an accused must be
prepared to

[Page 417]

defend (saving included offences) and fairness to
him, which the Criminal Code purports to express in accordance with the
fundamental conceptions residing in the presumption of innocence, dictates that
he not be taken beyond the bounds of what the Crown has chosen to lay against
him.

What is now s. 613(8) was considered by
Fauteux J., as he then was, in Welch v. The King[30], where he spoke for the majority of
the Court on an issue arising from a conviction on a charge of manslaughter
upon a second trial of the accused who had first been charged with murder and
convicted of manslaughter. The first verdict was set aside for misdirection and
the Ontario Court of Appeal either failed or refused to order a new trial or to
direct an acquittal, contenting itself with saying that although the conviction
would be set aside the accused was not acquitted. The second trial followed. In
the result, the majority of this Court allowed the accused’s appeal, quashed
the conviction on the second trial and ordered his discharge. What this Court
was concerned with in the Welch case was the incomplete judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the first proceeding and, hence, with the statutory
powers of courts of appeal on appeals in criminal cases. The explanation of the
Court of Appeal’s unusual decision neither to convict nor acquit nor to order a
new trial was the assumed impossibility under the Criminal Code of the
Crown laying a second indictment for manslaughter where the accused had been
acquitted on an indictment charging murder: see R. v. Pascal[31].

In the course of his reasons, and adverting
obviously to what is now s. 613(8), Fauteux J. said this (at p. 426):

…I fail, I must say with deference, to
appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the way of the Court of Appeal to
exercise its authority if, as suggested, the

[Page 418]

majority judges wanted to direct a new
trial only on this sole undisposed of part of the indictment, that is, the
lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and sufficient it would have been to
direct a new trial on the offence of manslaughter exclusively and to further
order that the original indictment of murder be, to that end, amended. Thus, on
this new trial, the accused could only be found guilty or not guilty of
manslaughter. The language of the statute is broad enough to embrace the
authority to make such “other order”, if the justice of the case suggests no
other. And I know of no principles of law which could have then been violated
by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that the exercise of the statutory
authority given to the Court of Appeal, under section 1014(3), to direct
an acquittal to be entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make
such other order as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.

This application of s. 613(8) does not
touch the present case but it clearly gives sensible subject-matter to the
provision in respect of the substitution of convictions for included offences
or orders for a new trial in respect of such offences.

A reference to what is now s. 613(8) is
also made in the dissenting reasons of Taschereau J., as he then was, Chief
Justice Rinfret concurring. The dissent was on another point but as to
s. 613(8), the learned justice said this (at p. 416):

I had the advantage of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court
of Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar,
it has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict
of acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two
courses has been followed that it may make such other order as justice
requires. It is however imperative and not only permissive, that
there should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.

I entertain no doubt that the Court of
Appeal had power by virtue of section 1014(3) of the Cr. C., after
haying quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the
charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the
concluding part of section 1014(3) Cr. C.

[Page 419]

I subscribe fully to this view and would
underline Taschereau J.’s words that “it is only when one of these two courses
[direction of an acquittal or of a new trial] has been followed that [the Court
of Appeal] may make such other order as justice requires”. (The italics
are those of Taschereau J.)

The Welch case appears to have been
applied in R. v. Kelso[32], where
the accused on an indictment for rape was convicted of attempted rape, and in
ordering a new trial because of misdirection the Court felt it could properly
order the new trial to proceed on the charge of attempted rape, not a very
surprising conclusion and, indeed, it may be doubted whether in the
circumstances of the Kelso case there was any need to rely on
s. 613(8): see also R. v. Robertson[33]. However, such reliance in case of
an included offence (as to which see R. v. Popoff[34]) is a long way from the issue confronting
this Court here.

Assuming, however, that s. 613(8) gives a
court of appeal a wider power than that which I think its terms confer when
considered alongside s. 613(4) and s. 605(1)(a), the relevant
question here is whether the words “make any order, in addition, that justice
requires” empower the court of appeal to direct a new trial on a different
offence from that on which the appeal was taken. It would be incongruous to me
if the Court of Appeal, under the relevant words of s. 613(8), could do
what the trial judge could not do under the wide amending powers given him
under s. 529. That aside, a consideration of the history of the words in
question in their original setting and in their present one does not lead to
the conclusion reached by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.

I begin the historical canvass with a statute of
pre-Confederation Canada, An Act for the Further Amendment of the
Administration of the Criminal Law, (1851) (Can.), c. 13, providing
for the reservation of questions of law arising in a criminal trial for the
opinion of a superior court. The question or

[Page 420]

questions of law were to be submitted by a
stated case and

…the Justices of either of the said
Superior Courts shall thereupon have full power and authority to hear and
finally determine the said questions, and thereupon to reverse, affirm or amend
any judgment which shall have been given on the indictment or inquisition on
the trial whereof such question or questions have arisen, or to avoid such
judgment, and to order an entry to be made on the record, that in the judgment
of the said Justices the party convicted ought not to have been convicted, or
to arrest the judgment, or order judgment to be given thereon at some other
Session of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or other Sessions of the Peace,
if no judgment shall have been before that time given, as they shall be advised,
or to make such other order as justice may require;…

This statute by its terms was in force only in
Upper Canada.

Similar provision for stating a case on a
reserved question of law is found in the Statutes of Lower Canada: see C.S.L.C.
1860, c. 77, s. 58. The Court of Queen’s Bench was authorized to
reverse, amend or affirm any judgment on the indictment in question, to avoid
or arrest judgment or “to make such other order as justice requires”. Section 3
of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada 1859, c. 112, was in similar
terms, and so was s. 101 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1864 (3rd
series), c. 171, and to the same effect was s. 23 of the Revised
Statutes of New Brunswick, 1854, c. 159. These provisions were virtually a
reproduction of English legislation, 1848 (U.K.), c. 78, and were
similarly entitled. When the statutes of Canada were first revised after
Confederation, the foregoing common provisions were superseded by s. 261
of the Criminal Procedure Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, which was as
follows:

261. The
justices of the court for Crown cases reserved, to which the case is
transmitted, shall hear and finally determine such question, and reverse,
affirm or amend any judgment given on the trial wherein such question arose, or
shall avoid such judgment or order an entry to be made on the record, that in
the judgment of such justices the person convicted ought not to have been
convicted, or shall arrest the judgment, or if no judgment has been given,
shall order judgment to be given thereon at some future session of the court
before

[Page 421]

which the person was convicted, or shall
make such other order as justice requires.

The new Criminal Code of 1892 retained
provision for the reserving of questions of law arising during a trial but to
be considered by courts of appeal upon a case stated: see s. 743. The Code
improved upon the previous law governing appeals in criminal cases by the
enactment of a composite provision, s. 746, reading as follows:

746. …

(a) confirm the ruling
appealed from; or

(b) if of opinion that the
ruling was erroneous, and that there has been a mis-trial in consequence,
direct a new trial; or

(c) if it considers the
sentence erroneous, or the arrest of judgment erroneous, pass such a sentence
as ought to have been passed or set aside any sentence passed by the court
below, and remit the case to the court below with a direction to pass the
proper sentence; or

(d) if of opinion in a case
in which the accused has been convicted that the ruling was erroneous, and that
the accused ought to have been acquitted, direct that the accused shall be
discharged, which order shall have all the effects of an acquittal; or

(e) direct a new trial; or

(f) make such other order as justice
requires: Provided that no conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial
directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or
rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some
misdirection given, unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial
wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the
Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly
disallowed a new trial shall be granted.

2. If it appears to the Court of Appeal
that such wrong or miscarriage affected some count only of the indictment the
court may give separate directions as to each count and may pass sentence on
any count unaffected by such wrong or miscarriage which stands good, or may
remit the case to the court below with directions to pass such sentence as
justice may require.

[Page 422]

Section 746 of the original Code came
down in subsequently revised form to the present s. 613, and
s. 613(8) may be looked upon as a transformed version of s. 746(f).

The case law on the pre-Confederation and
post-Confederation legislation cited above, at least until it was subsumed
under the new Criminal Code, established that although the sufficiency
of an indictment was a question that could be reserved in arrest of judgment
(see R. v. Gibson[35], holding,
however, that the sufficiency of an indictment could not be challenged on a
motion to quash), there was no power on the consideration of a reserved
question to amend the indictment: see R. v. Garland[36]. The Court said in the Garland case,
at p. 227, that “our powers do not extend to amending the indictment. We
can only deal with the judgment; and if we amend the judgment here the record
will be wrong”. A fortiori, there was no power to direct the
substitution of a different charge.

I referred earlier in these reasons to the
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. More and Melville[37], and, risking repetition, I wish to
mention again what was there decided. The Court took a cautious approach to the
question of its power to direct a new trial on an amended indictment involving
an essential averment, namely, the place of commission of the offence of
unlawful possession of stolen property. After considering the Welch case
and some others the majority concluded that it had no power to amend the
indictment in that respect but, in the special circumstances, it could order a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to determine whether an amendment to
the charge was necessary and whether it should be made. The dissenting Chief Justice
Desbrisay agreed that the Court of Appeal had no power to amend and would have
entered an acquittal. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court en

[Page 423]

banc applied More
and Melville in R. v. Rooney[38]
to deny to an appellate court the power to amend an indictment. In the
result in that case, which involved a conviction on a charge of obtaining money
by false pretences but the proof did not go higher than showing that the
accused had obtained a cheque by false representations, the majority of the
Court ordered a new trial because, in the words of McDonald J. for the majority
at p. 196, “it appears that evidence does exist by which a case may be
proved properly, with or without amendment of the charge by the magistrate”.
The opposing view was put by Ilsley C.J. in dissent (Currie J. concurring),
namely, that this was not a case where because of some mistake in the conduct
of the trial the conviction could not stand although there was evidence to
convict on a proper trial, but rather it was a case where the Crown had failed
to prove guilt of the offence charged and “for this Court to order a new trial
would be to place again the appellant in jeopardy… in order to give the Crown
another opportunity to secure his conviction on an amended charge” (at
p. 192).

I refer to one more decision, that of the New
Brunswick Court of Appeal in Budovitch v. The Queen[39]. It involved a conviction for
fraudulently failing to pay over or account for money, the charge alleging the
offence to have been committed in Fredericton. The evidence showed that, if
committed, it was in Saint John. On appeal, a new trial was ordered on a charge
which alleged an offence in Saint John, the majority purporting to invoke what
is now s. 613(8) in directing the amendment to be made at the new trial.
Hughes J.A., as he then was, would, following the Rooney case (as
holding there was no power to amend the indictment on appeal), have ordered a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to make the appropriate amendment
under what is now s. 529, pointing

[Page 424]

out there was uncontradicted evidence of a theft
in New Brunswick.

Although Budovitch goes beyond More
and Melville and beyond Rooney in directing a new trial on an
amended charge, it is nonetheless simply a case where the amendment was within
the trial judge’s power, relating as it did to an essential particular in the
charge, but not to a different charge, and, moreover, a particular on which
evidence had been adduced, that is as to the place of commission of the
offence.

I do not find anything in the case law, and
certainly nothing in applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal to
do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did here, something which the
trial judge himself could not do. There is here a usurpation of the function of
the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the existing
charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the Court
felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court to
take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The appellant and one Arthur James
Williams were charged together on an indictment dated October 22, 1974, with
the following offences:

1. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973, they and Stuart Hunter Elliott, Lois Phoebe

[Page 425]

Elliott, Jerry Dean Elliott, Myron Zarry,
Shirley Ferguson, Ingrid Elliott, unlawfully did conspire together the one with
the other or others of them, and persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of trafficking in a restricted drug, to wit, 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

2. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973 they did unlawfully traffic in a restricted drug, to wit;
3, 4, Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such
case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, and her
Crown and Dignity.

3. THAT in the County of Nanaimo, Province
of British Columbia on or about the 17th day of December A.D. 1973 they did
unlawfully have in their possession a restricted drug, to wit; 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the
form of statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our
Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

At the trial before Cashman C.C.J., both accused
were acquitted on the first count of this indictment, the appellant alone was
convicted on the second count but acquitted on the third. The learned trial
judge entered the latter acquittal on the ground that he had already convicted
the appellant of “trafficking” on the second count and that the offences
charged in these two counts were so intermingled that he could not distinguish
the one from the other; he therefore invoked the judgment of this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen[40], and
thus concluded that the matter was res judicata.

When the appellant appealed his conviction on
the second count, the Court of Appeal directed an acquittal on the ground that
although it had been proved that the appellant had substantial quantities of a
salt designated MDA hydrochloride in his possession for the purpose of sale and
distribution, it was not shown that he was in possession of MDA itself for the
purpose of trafficking or otherwise.

[Page 426]

All the counts in the indictment were laid under
the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27,
s. 40 of which defines a “restricted drug” as including
“methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) or any salt thereof”. The Court of Appeal
being satisfied that trafficking in the salt constituted a separate offence
which was not charged in the indictment, allowed the appellant’s appeal.

In appealing the verdict of acquittal on the
third count, the Crown applied to amend the charge by adding the words “a salt
of” prior to the words “3, 4,MDA” so that the allegation would comply with the
facts as disclosed by the evidence and found by the Court of Appeal in the
appeal against conviction on count 2. This application was granted and the
Court ordered “that the appeal against acquittal be allowed, the acquittal set
aside and a new trial ordered on the indictment as amended”. Judgment on this
application was rendered on behalf of the Court by Mr. Justice MacLean who
had presided at the appeal from the conviction on the second count and, as I
have said, it is clear that the Court of Appeal in disposing of that count
treated the charge of being in possession of MDA and being in possession of a
salt thereof as two separate charges, although McIntyre J.A., speaking for the
majority of the Court, clearly indicated that he regarded the designation of
“MDA” in the charge as a “particular” and would have considered an amendment
appropriate after hearing the appeal had one been sought.

In considering the third count, however, the
Court of Appeal, differently constituted, appears to have recognized that the
charge was that the accused “did unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug… for the purpose of trafficking” and that the failure to allege
possession of “a salt of MDA” constituted a failure to allege “a particular” of
the offence which was capable of being added by way of amendment, in order to
conform to the evidence which the Court had accepted in disposing of count 2.

The latter amendment did not in my opinion have
the effect of charging a new offence as it did

[Page 427]

no more than specify a particular of the offence
which had already been charged. If I thought the amendment to be tantamount to
the charge of a different offence from that contained in the original count,
other considerations might apply, but what we have here is a particularization
of an ingredient of the main charge which was made necessary by the evidence
which the Court had already accepted and which had in fact been in great
measure conceded by the appellant.

Mr. Justice MacLean’s judgment on this
application is very brief and I reproduce it in full:

In this case the Crown applies for an
amendment of the indictment, some considerable time after conclusion of the
trial, applying to this Court rather than to the court below.

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

I would accordingly allow the amendment of
the third count in the indictment, allow the appeal of the Crown, set aside the
acquittal and direct a new trial on the third count as amended.

It is from this decision and the order granted
pursuant thereto that the appellant now appeals alleging:

(i) that as the trial judge had found count
three to be indistinguishable from count two, it followed that by acquitting
the appellant with respect to count two the Court of Appeal had necessarily
disposed of the Crown’s appeal on count three and that the Court of Appeal
lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s appeal on this count; (Kienapple
v. The Queen was cited in support of this contention.)

(ii) that proceedings by way of appeal relating
to several counts in an indictment which had been tried together cannot be
severed by the Crown in the Court of Appeal;

(iii) that there is no power in the Court of
Appeal to amend an indictment so as to conform with the evidence, this power
being limited to the trial court by reason of ss. 529, 610 and 613 of the Criminal
Code.

[Page 428]

In acquitting the appellant on count 2 the Court
of Appeal did not, in my view, dispose of the third count; it did on the other
hand dispose of the reason given by the trial judge for his acquittal on that
count. It will be observed that the gravamen of the offence under these counts
is in the one case that the accused did “unlawfully traffic in a restricted
drug…” and in the other that they did “unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking”. The whole gist of the decision
in the Court of Appeal on count 2 was that although the appellant was guilty of
having possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of
trafficking, the salt was not a drug specified in the particulars of the
indictment. It remained for the Crown to seek an order amending count 3 of the
indictment so as to conform to the evidence. Far from having been disposed of
by the appellant’s acquittal by the Court of Appeal on count 2, the Crown’s
appeal from the acquittal on count 3 had not then been heard by the Court and
it was open to the Crown to pursue it.

Having found that the appellant was in fact in
possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of trafficking,
Mr. Justice MacLean indicated that he would have been disposed to allow an
amendment to the second count of the indictment even after the hearing of the
appeal. The fact that the Crown did not seek such an amendment in no way
precluded it from applying to amend count 3 so as to conform to the evidence
described in Mr. Justice McIntyre’s reasons for judgment. The case of Kienapple
does not appear to me to have any application in this situation as that
case was concerned essentially with the proposition that an accused cannot be
convicted twice for the same offence.

The second ground of appeal advanced on behalf
of the appellant to the effect that counts in an indictment cannot be severed
in the Court of Appeal appears to me to overlook the course of proceedings at
trial in the present case. Here the learned trial judge disposed of the first
and second counts by a judgment rendered on January 31, 1975, and only then
proceeded to consider the

[Page 429]

third count against Elliott alone (a stay of
proceedings having been entered with respect to Williams). The third count was
thus effectively severed from counts 1 and 2 by the trial judge who proceeded
to consider that count separately and to dispose of it by a judgment dated
February 24, 1975.

In so doing, the learned trial judge purported
to act in accordance with s. 43 of the Food and Drugs Act and it
therefore appears to me to be desirable to consider the following provisions of
that statute:

42. (1) No
person shall traffic in a restricted drug or any substance represented or held
out by him to be a restricted drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession
any restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

43. (1) In
any prosecution for a violation of subsection 42(2), if the accused does
not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if the issue to be tried is
whether the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1).

(2) If, pursuant to subsection (1),
the court finds that the accused was not in possession of a restricted drug
contrary to subsection 41(1), he shall be acquitted, but, if the court
finds that the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1), he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he
was not in possession of the restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking and
thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an opportunity of adducing evidence to
the contrary.

In purported compliance with these provisions,
Judge Cashman made the following statement in his judgment on the third count:

As required by Section 43 of the Food
and Drugs Act… I made a finding that the accused Elliott was in possession
of MDA on December 17th, 1973.

It was then agreed by Counsel that I should
make findings on Counts 1 and 2 with respect to each accused on these counts
before the accused Elliott be given an opportunity to establish that he was not
in possession of MDA for the purpose of trafficking.

Later in his judgment the learned trial judge
reasoned as follows:

[Page 430]

If the accused was before me on a charge of
possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA and that was the only charge
before me then in the circumstances in which the MDA was found I would have no
difficulty in concluding it to be a fair inference from the evidence that the
accused had that quantity of MDA for the purpose of physically making MDA available
to other persons.

And he went on to say:

The question is not whether the accused can
be convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA in the
circumstances of this case but whether he should as a matter of law be
convicted of that offence, he having been convicted on the same evidence of
trafficking in MDA.

He then concluded:

In my opinion the two offences charged here
in Counts 2 and 3 are so intermingled that I cannot say that one is distinct
from the other.

It is my view that in the circumstances
here were I to convict the accused of both offences I would in reality be
convicting the accused twice of the same offence.

In Kienapple v. The Queen (supra) in
the C.R.N.S. volume at page 7, Laskin, J. said this:

In my view, the term res judicata best
expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for the same delict,
although the matter is the basis of two separate offences.

Accordingly I find that I cannot convict
the accused Elliott on Count 3 and I make that finding notwithstanding that
during the course of the Trial pursuant to Section 43 I found the accused to be
in possession of MDA. My inability to convict the accused Elliott is not due to
a matter of fact but rather to a matter of law for the reasons stated above.

As I have pointed out, the Court of Appeal has
found that the appellant was in possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA)
within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Food and Drugs Act and the
effect of the amendment granted by Mr. Justice MacLean is to give the
appellant “an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking” as provided by s. 43(2) of
the Food and Drugs Act.

[Page 431]

In my opinion the only issue before this Court
on the present appeal is whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers when
it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform to
the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that count
as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having regard
to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, I do not think that it can
be suggested that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that
salt was not mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was
being charged with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

In directing a new trial, Mr. Justice
MacLean incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt
that the ends of justice required him to do.

In granting this order it seems to me to be
plain that the Court of Appeal was acting pursuant to the provisions of
s. 613(4)(b) and (8) which provide as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may…

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

(i) order a new trial,…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection… (4),… it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the order for a new trial could not have been made unless the amendment had
been granted and that the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to
the exercise of the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i), but rather that
it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial.

In my view when Parliament authorized the Court
of Appeal, in the exercise of its power, to order a new trial, to “make any
order, in addition, which justice requires” it must be taken as having
authorized that Court under those circumstances to make any additional order
which the ends of justice require whether the order for a new trial is
dependent upon the additional order or not. I do

[Page 432]

not think that the wide powers conferred on the
Court of Appeal by s. 613(8) are to be narrowly construed but rather that
they are designed to ensure that the requirements of the ends of justice are
met, and are to be liberally construed in light of that overriding consideration.

In ordering a new trial it would normally be
undesirable to comment on the evidence, but I think that in this case the
concessions made by the appellant on his appeal are relevant as indicating the
material of which the Court must have been aware in determining that the ends
of justice required a new trial on the third count.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
appeal on the second count, Mr. Justice McIntyre, with whom all members of
the Court agreed, had this to say:

The appellant conceded that the police had
found M.D.A. hydrochloride a salt of MDA upon the premises and conceded that it
was manufactured by the appellant. Indeed, in the absence of such a concession
there was positive proof that MDA hydrochloride had been manufactured in
substantial quantity and that it was intended for sale and distribution.

Seized with knowledge of this evidence, it is
small wonder that Mr. Justice MacLean considered the ends of justice to
require the amendment which he granted and that no substantial wrong was done
to the appellant by granting it. I fully agree with this conclusion and would
affirm the order that implemented it.

In the course of the argument in this Court
reference was made to other cases in which provincial courts of appeal have
granted amendments to an indictment as to which there was no complaint made at
trial, but the circumstances disclosed in each of these cases differs
materially from the situation disclosed in this appeal and I prefer to base my
conclusion on the broad ground that the ends of justice required the amendment
which was here granted. It follows that I find it unnecessary to express any
view as to the submission that the authority of the Court of Appeal to grant an
amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3) of the Criminal Code which
authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be exercised by the

[Page 433]

court on appeals in civil matters…”. In my view
a final determination of this question can be appropriately considered when it
is an essential element in the disposition of the appeal.

In the course of the argument reference was made
to the provisions of s. 529 of the Criminal Code which bears the
heading “Amending defective indictment or count” but in my view the only
mandatory language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which
provides for

an objection to an indictment or to a count
in an indictment or a defect apparent on the face thereof…

and requires such objection to be taken before
plea or thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case we are
not concerned with a defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly has no application to the present circumstances. In
my view there is no other language in the section which can be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8) which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
conclusion reached by the Chief Justice in this appeal and the reasons
therefor, with one reservation. I would like to leave open the issue as to
whether s. 529(1) or s. 732(1) of the Criminal Code prevents
initial objection being taken in the Court of Appeal to a defect on the face of
the indictment or information and the effect of the judgment in R. v.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 May, 15 July, and 15 September last year the appellant was before his Honour Magistrate Gordon Lerve upon four charges. I understand he was acquitted of one, as to another I have not been informed of its outcome. He does however appeal against the findings of guilty and conviction recorded in respect of a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol and a further charge of exceeding the speed limit by greater than 45 kilometres per hour.2 These two offences were said to have occurred at the same time on 7 February 2004. The appeal is by way of a re-hearing on the transcript and evidence before his Honour in the court below. On that occasion the appellant did not give evidence. He has been granted leave to adduce his own evidence and evidence from his wife. I gave leave to the Crown to adduce evidence in reply so it could deal with allegations that had not been made in evidence by the appellant that had not been put in the court below. The appellant was unrepresented and appeared in person.3 The prosecution case was that at about 11.35 pm two highway patrol officers were patrolling in the Kellyville area. They saw the appellant turn right into Memorial Avenue from Windsor Road. They followed him. They noticed he was speeding. Memorial Avenue is a short street, little more than half a kilometre. The appellant turned left into Balmoral without using indicators. He increased speed. Their radar equipment locked onto the vehicle doing 119 kilometres per hour. The patrol officers pursued the vehicle. At least one of them knew who the driver was and where he lived. They were anxious to reach him before he reached home. They activated their blue strobe lamps and flashed the high beams.4 The appellant reached his home which was several hundred meters south of Old Windsor Road. The appellant indicated and turned left into the drive of 494 Old Windsor Road when he alighted from the motor vehicle. It would appear he had driven something in the order of two kilometres or so from the time he was locked in at 119 kilometres per hour. Time-wise that appear to be about a minute or so of driving between the vehicle’s speed being measured and the appellant pulling up at his back door.5 When he arrived at 494 Old Windsor Road the appellant alighted from his motor vehicle. Each patrol officer independently formed the view he was under the influence of alcohol. In the light of that uncontested evidence it is not surprising the learned Magistrate convicted the appellant of these two offences.6 The appellant’s evidence is he neither sped nor had drunk more than 700 mils of Crown lager since 8 pm that evening. In the light of his denials a more careful scrutiny of the Crown evidence is required.7 Any examination of the appellant’s evidence suggests that he is intelligent, and that has a real hesitancy in his speech patterns. He is cautious, rephrases and allows himself time to think by frequent use of the speech filler “um”. That is not to say he does not express himself with precision. He does, his evidence occupied all of four hours and possibly more.8 His wife gave evidence first. It is fair to say her evidence contributed nothing to the resolution of this case. She was in China on 7 February 2004 and did not return until a month later. He had talked to her between 8 and 8.30 pm on 7 February and so far as she could tell, he was sober during that telephone conversation.9 The appellant’s account was that he had been working all day Saturday 7th. It was a hot day. He was physically tired when he returned home at about 8 pm. His wife reminded him of the 700 mil bottle of Crown lager. He consumed some, or all of the beer, whether warm or cold is unclear on the evidence, watched a movie and dozed in front of the TV. He awoke invigorated, decided he would go for a drive, made his way to Vineyard, refuelled in the dark the tractor he was using the following day, and returned home. He stopped to shop at a local BP service station and collected four bags of groceries.10 On the return journey he noticed the highway patrol vehicle at Memorial Avenue travelling in the opposite direction to him. He followed other cars into Memorial and Balmoral, he maintained the speed limit, he turned into Old Windsor Road and then into his premises. He had to stop to open the driveway gate. He drove down what he said was 120 meter driveway, had delivered two loads of groceries in bags to the back steps and was in the process of delivering a third when the police vehicle arrived in his driveway with lights flashing.11 He recognised Senior Constable Crompton, the patrol officer driving the highway patrol vehicle who, by this time had left the police vehicle and was making his way on foot towards the appellant. The appellant lifted the two groceries bags holding them in front of him, shaking them slightly to indicate that he was taking them from the car towards the house as the case may be.12 Senior Constable Crompton was holding a handheld tape recorder and informed the offender he was taping the conversations. I will return to this aspect of the case shortly.13 There were conversations between them. On the appellant’s account Senior Constable Crompton approached quickly, grabbed him and said “You were going to decamp.” The appellant was handcuffed. A VB bottle lid was picked up from the ground and Senior Constable Crompton said “Is this a souvenir from the night?” The appellant refused to engage in any conversation other than on two occasions because he recognised he was being framed. 14 A caged truck was called. He was taken to the police station. Two charges were ultimately preferred, neither said the appellant had any merit.15 There is no doubt Senior Constable Crompton taped with a handheld tape recorder all conversation between him and the appellant, and other conversation in which he does not appear to have played a role, although the appellant does. That conversation occurs later, apparently at the police station.16 The now Senior Sergeant Crompton said something in evidence before me which leads me to believe that it is his practice to use the tape recorder to “protect himself.” The evidence was not objected to in the Local Court. The appellant was unrepresented in this court. The evidence coming from the tape conversations as matters turned out favoured both sides.17 While I have not heard submissions nor researched other than to note the provisions of s 5 of the Listening Devices Act, my preliminary view is both the taping of conversations and the publication of the contents of the tape amount to criminal offences that carry a maximum penalty of two years. I make available to the parties s 5 and s 11 of the Listening Devices Act hopefully for the edification of both sides. It may well be that there is some exception to the police although I doubt it, because I note that there is a provision in the Listening Devices Act allowing police to tape a refusal of somebody to engage in an ERISP. Put another way, the evidence tendered from the tape conversation may well have been illegally or unlawfully obtained.18 The cross-examination of Senior Sergeant Crompton discloses a “history” with the appellant. In 1997 the appellant complained to the Ombudsman and/or some other authority about a specific incident involving then Senior Constable Crompton. Senior Constable Crompton, in his evidence before the Local court, was of the view that not only had the appellant complained about him but every other officer at the Castle Hill Police station (see tape). Senior Constable Crompton told his Honour in evidence that police had frequently been called to the appellant’s premises and that he was a high risk offender. Senior Constable Crompton also agreed in the Local court he had breathalysed the appellant two nights earlier and had stopped him for that purpose because he was a high risk offender, there being as I understand it, no other probably cause to use an American phrase.19 It is not difficult to discern from the cross-examination of Senior Constable Crompton he has a very fixed antipathetic attitude towards the appellant. Indeed his willingness, gratuitously to reveal this antipathetic attitude to the appellant through cross-examination raises the question of whether this officer of twenty-one years has maintained his professionalism in this case.20 The unlawful use of the tape recorder also raises the same issue of one of professionalism. His statement makes reference to the appellant’s “rolling his body out of the car seat”, “slowly, clumsily movements wiping his face with his right hand”, “bloodshot eyes, glazed in appearance with enlarged pupils” (observed from 5 meters on a dark night), I interpolate in darkness pupils would become enlarged in any event.21 The patrol officer’s observations continued “his movements were sluggish and he continued to stumble and trip over himself as he walked”, “he lurched to the left falling against a metal frame near the wall of the house.” There were occasions when the appellant looked “blankly” at Senior Constable Crompton. Senior Constable Crompton’s evidence was the appellant was at the high end of moderately affected by alcohol.22 Senior Constable Jurd, the other highway patrol officer, while he comes to a view the appellant was “well affected by alcohol”, makes an assessment that does not appear to be based upon the same assessment of events as Senior Constable Crompton. For example he has the offender “immediately getting out of the driver’s side seat”, “stumbling about and stumbling on the spot”, “unsteady on his feet”, “slumped over when he was standing”, “unable to walk a straight line”, “tripped over his own feet.” “So he tripped over his own feet a number of times”, “making a dash for the back door of his residence”, “sweating profusely”, “bloodshot eyes (as does Senior Constable Crompton)” and “clothes, disorganised.”23 Senior Constable Jerd has I think seven years experience. I do not regard Senior Constable Jerd’s assessment as supporting Senior Constable Crompton’s. The details do not match. Both, it is true, reach a view the appellant is well affected but they could have been assessing two different persons.24 Nor was I impressed with the corruption of the use of the tape recorder. My understanding of its purpose was to record conversations between the appellant and Senior Constable Crompton. He, Senior Constable Crompton, told the transporting officers they were not to speak to the appellant unless the tape recorder was activated. Yet conversations containing opinion evidence and self serving statements were recorded at the scene. See for example Senior Constable Jerd, “You look like you had a bit to drink”; see also paragraph 22 (of Senior Constable Crompton’s statement) when Senior Constable Crompton says, “It was obvious to us that you were well and truly exceeding the speed limit.” Conversations at paragraph 25 of arrangements being made between the two police officers; conversations at paragraph 27, “Why did you elbow me, now you’ve got an assault police on your hands”; paragraph 28, “he just took exception to me and smacked me in the chest”; comment from Jerd, “the smell of alcohol is strong”; reply from Senior Constable Crompton, “Yeah, he’s rotten, there’s no doubt about that”; Senior Constable Jerd, “That would explain why he didn’t stop until he got into his premises”; Senior Constable Crompton, “That’s right and try to walk away from me and go into his house for his licence and he’s got his wallet in his pocket”; paragraph 30, “I said, “He’s already had a shot at me, put his elbow into my chest...so.”25 Each of those items of conversations I have referred to was never admissible as evidence in a trial on the issues before me. The fact that it is contemporary comment does not make it admissible, but does make it dangerous. Its appearance on the tape again brings into question the professionalism of the officers involved.26 The two transport officers would appear to have been told the basis of the appellant’s arrest and the likely charges. Neither transport officer had the quality of contact with the appellant that Senior Constable Crompton and Senior Constable Jerd had. However, it is to be remembered Senior Constable Crompton makes the point that from the moment the appellant alighted from the car it “became apparent to me very quickly the appellant was under the influence of alcohol or a drug.”27 From Jerd’s perspective the first thing the appellant did when he alighted from the car was to “step away from his vehicle where he stumbled about... I watched as he continued to stumble on the spot.”28 Detective Senior Constable Crompton said the appellant was “very unsteady on his feet”, “unable to walk in a straight line as I guided him towards the gate.”29 Constable Nasser, one of the officers who transported the appellant to Castle Hill was apparently not gifted with the same obvious observations. His only comment was that when he opened the door of the caged truck he noticed “a strong smell of alcohol coming from the appellant.” At the police station the appellant walked in front of them into the station apparently without any assistance. Constable Nasser made no comment otherwise suggesting the appellant was incapacitated in any way in his walking or otherwise affected by alcohol.30 Constable Voigt was even less helpful to the prosecution case. She made no comment about smelling alcohol or observing any symptom of behaviour that would be consistent with the appellant being under the influence of alcohol.31 I have heard the tape of Senior Constable Crompton and the appellant walking down the driveway to the front gate of the appellant’s premises. There is nothing in the rhythm of the footsteps as I hear the crunch upon the gravel that would persuade me one of the walkers was stumbling, tripping over himself or otherwise having difficulty maintaining a constant gait as he walked with the other.32 Sergeant Vince Fusca was a shift supervisor/custody manager at Castle Hill station in the early morning of 8 September 2004. He made a visual assessment of the appellant. He had of course been told by Senior Constable Crompton that the appellant was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor. That conversation between those two officers occurred at 00.35 am. One minute later, at 00.36 am Sergeant Fusca's visual assessment based upon an unsteady on his feet, strong smell of alcohol and a strong thirst of the appellant (amazing that that was noticed within one minute), was, ""I formed the view that the appellant’s behaviour was suggestive of him being under the influence of drugs and alcohol."" I give little weight to that opinion in those circumstances.33 I have heard the tape of the appellant speaking at the police station. There was none of the hesitancy apparent at court. He was articulate, clearly spoken, there were no slurring of words, much of what is said did him no credit in the sense that it was aggressive and on at least one occasion threatening towards Senior Constable Crompton. Be that as it may it did not sound like the voice of a man who was so unsteady on his feet that he was stumbling on the spot or could not walk a straight line.34 Both police observed the appellant’s driving. Each has reported upon the speed at which he was driving. Neither suggests that in any feature of his driving was he lacking in eye, hand coordination or vision or judgment or steering other than the speed at which he was travelling and his failure to indicate a left hand turn at a point in the road where the intersection was of a Y kind and the appellant chose the left hand option and the turn was not anything more than thirty or so degrees.35 In my view there is a reasonable possibility the three descriptions given as to the appellant’s state of sobriety are overstated. I am satisfied there was a smell of alcohol upon his breath. Before the appellant can be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol it is necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of driving. The prosecution in my view has failed to do so.36 On the other hand the evidence of both officers as to the speed of driving and the path of the vehicle was supportive of each other. In my view it is highly unlikely that this evidence is fabricated and that the police would have appeared at the appellant’s premises perhaps a minute or two after he had driven other than because they were satisfied they had him caught, if I can put it that way, for speeding.37 Senior Constable Crompton’s evidence was that the target window of the radar was still flashing 119 when he pointed it out to the appellant. The appellant’s case is that this was not done and that his car was incapable of travelling at such a speed.38 The appellant has not impressed me as a witness of truth. I regard his account of travelling to refuel a tractor, twenty minutes drive away, at night after a hard day’s work as incredible. Given his desire to conserve time, to travel to Vineyard and back was a waste of 40 minutes, precious time, when he would be with the tractor the following morning after a drive he had to make in any event. In those circumstances he would have dedicated only ten minutes to refuelling the tractor rather than the 50 minutes he sought to persuade the court he had used for that purpose.39 Further, it is inexplicable to me why he should take such a large sum of money as he had in his pocket. Ultimately he purchases four bags of groceries on his account, yet among the property seized were several one hundred dollar bills.40 I am satisfied from what I heard on the tape he did have a bottle top in his pocket. I reject his account that it was on the ground. The way in which it was itemised satisfies me it was part of his property. I reject his account that the bottle top was on the ground. What significance that bottle top has in any event is another matter, but his account of it being on the ground adversely affects his believability.41 Nonetheless I still must be satisfied even though I reject his account on the speed that the prosecution has proved its case. I have already indicated I would be so satisfied and I am. Therefore I find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellant’s speed was accurately clocked at 119 kilometres per hour.42 The formal orders I will be making are that the conviction for the drive whilst under the influence of alcohol will be quashed, but the drive speed 119 kilometres per hour or in excess of 45 kilometres of the speed limit will be proved and the conviction will stand.SUBMISSIONS MADE BY PARTIES43 HIS HONOUR: The conviction appeal in respect of the speeding offence is confirmed. The penalty imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. The penalty imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. The period of disqualification imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. That period of disqualification will now have expired.44 The conviction in respect of drive under the influence of alcohol is quashed. The period of disqualification and the fine in respect of the drive under the influence of alcohol conviction are likewise quashed.

11739,2761939,Kemp v KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 964,"Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 12 July 2013 by the prosecutor, Peter Stewart Kemp. Thereby an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant, KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, be brought before a judge of this Court to answer a charge under s 53(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 was sought.

2The prosecutor, a senior investigator in the Investigation and Enforcement Unit of the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), relied on an affidavit he had sworn on 11 July 2013, to which was annexed various documents, to support the application. 

3When the proceedings came before me, sitting as duty judge, on 12 July 2013, I made orders in terms sought in the summons. My reasons for making those orders follow.

The factual background

4The prosecutor relied on briefs of evidence prepared by RMS and by NSW Police, as part of their investigations into an accident that had occurred on 14 July 2011 at Bathurst. They revealed that a heavy vehicle combination was delivering a load of steel beams from Newcastle to Orange that day. Part of the load swung out from the combination while it was travelling along the Mitchell Highway, colliding with a vehicle being driven in the opposite direction by Ms Leonie Darling, causing her death. Part of the load then fell from the combination, striking five other vehicles. 

5The driver of the combination, Mr Basil White, was later charged with manslaughter.

The charge under s 53(1) of the 2005 Act

6Section 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act empowers the Court to order a person to be brought before the Court for the purpose of answering a charge brought under the Court's summary jurisdiction. The prosecutor's case was that such an order would be made if a prima facie case under s 53(1) of the 2005 Act was established on the material relied on.

7Section 53(1) of the 2005 Act provided:

""53 Liability of consignor

...

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and
(b) the person is the consignor of any goods that are in or on the vehicle or combination concerned.""


A prima facie case of breach of the load restraint requirements of s 53(1)(a) was established

8The prosecutor's case was that relevant to the breach of the load restraint requirement alleged was the provisions of clause 61 of the Road Transport (Mass, Loading and Access) Regulation 2005, which provided:

""61 Load requirements

(1) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must not be placed in a way that makes the vehicle unstable or unsafe.

(2) A load on a vehicle or a trailer must be secured so that it is unlikely to fall or be dislodged from the vehicle.

(3) An appropriate method must be used to restrain the load on a vehicle.

(4) In proceedings for a contravention of a requirement under this clause, it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the load on the vehicle was not placed, secured or restrained (as the case requires) in a way that met the performance standards recommended in the Load Restraint Guide: Guidelines and performance standards for the safe carriage of loads on road vehicles, Second Edition, as published by the National Transport Commission in April 2004.""


9Annexed to the prosecutor's affidavit, amongst other things, was a report of Mr Di Cristoforo, a road safety engineer who had been instructed by NSW Police to provide an expert report as to the manner of loading the load on the combination. 

10There Mr Di Cristoforo referred to the 'Load Restraint Guide' published in 2004 by the National Transport Commission, which refers to various requirements, including dunnage to be placed on a trailer deck. He explained the basis for his opinion that the type of wood used in the dunnage of the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was inadequate for the load being carried; and that for reasons which he explained, that this deficiency permitted the catastrophic movement of the load which caused the accident. 

11I was satisfied that the material relied on established a prima facie case, that the breach of the load restraint requirements of s 53(1)(a) alleged, had occurred.

A prima facie case that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd was the consignor of the goods carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident was established

12The prosecutor also alleged that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd was the consignor of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

13The prosecutor relied on a document annexed to his affidavit. It was a document under the letterhead of KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, signed by Dusko Knezevic, Operations Manager of KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd, which confirmed its consignment of the load carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011 accident.

14I was satisfied that the material relied upon established a prima facie case that it was KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd who was the consignor of the goods being carried by the combination involved in the 14 July 2011accident.

Result and orders

15In the result, I was satisfied that the prosecutor had established a prima facie case that KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd had committed the offence alleged and accordingly made the orders sought under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

      JUDGMENT - Application for change of venue 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Nine men are charged with conspiracy to do acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act or acts contrary to sections 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. They have been in custody since November 2005. They were arraigned before the Supreme Court on 31 May 2007 and their trial was set down for hearing on 25 February 2008.  
     
      
    2 At the time the proceedings were set down for hearing, it was anticipated that the trial venue would probably be in the Darlinghurst Court complex used by the Supreme Court of New South Wales for criminal trials. This is a very old complex and, despite its historical and heritage significance, it is sadly in need of repair and modernisation. It is, however, a favoured venue for trials for many criminal lawyers because of its proximity to the city and their chambers.  
     
      
    3 Unfortunately, it has, for reasons I will explain, not been possible to hold the trial in or close to the Central Business District. The trial commenced on 25 February 2008 at the new Sydney West Trial Courts situated in the legal precinct of Parramatta near the spacious surrounds of Parramatta Park and the river.  
     
      
    4 It is fair to say that from the moment this prospect was made clear to the legal representatives of the accused, there has been a concerted movement to abort the hearing at Parramatta and to change the venue to Sydney, or at least to some closer venue than the city of Parramatta. This has culminated in a spate of applications to the Court seeking a change of venue.  
     
      
    5 In November 2007, I directed that applications of this kind should await hearing until the pre-trial applications began on 25 February 2008 at Parramatta. I did so because, amongst other reasons, it seemed to me that it would be more appropriate to await the completion of the new Court complex at Parramatta and to experience its facilities, before making any decision as to its suitability or otherwise.  
     
      
    6 The application for change of venue is made pursuant to section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “30 In any criminal proceedings, if it appears to the Court: 
         
         
          
          (a) that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that for any other reason it is expedient to do so 
           
          the Court may change the venue and direct the trial to be held in such other district or at such other place as the Court thinks fit, and may for that purpose make all such orders as justice appears to require. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Applications for change of venue are assigned to the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court (Part 75 rule 3).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Before moving to the merits of the application, I should mention the circumstances which led to the Sydney West Trial Courts being selected as the trial venue. The committal hearing for the nine accused had taken place at the Penrith Court complex. This raised considerable problems for the lawyers involved, as daily movement between Sydney and Penrith was plainly inconvenient.  
     
      
    8 It is fair to say that by time of the arraignment hearing in May 2007 a number of steps were already in process to identify suitable accommodation for the trial. Because of the number of accused, the likely number of legal representatives, public interest in the matter and the likely length of the trial, a suitable venue was difficult to find. Reliable information provided to me at the time indicated that the King Street complex in Sydney was not suitable because none of the courtrooms was large enough. Penrith was simply too far away and, more importantly, the courtroom had insufficient space to conduct a jury trial of this dimension. The multi-accused Court at the Downing Centre was rejected because the courtroom shape and design could not accommodate even thirty legal representatives at Bar tables.  
     
      
    9 The only realistic alternatives left were the Darlinghurst Court complex and the new Parramatta trial court building. The latter was, as at May 2007, under construction but not likely to be completed until the end of the year.  
     
      
    10 It was hoped from the outset that Darlinghurst might be a realistic location for the trial. This was because one large wing of the complex could be sealed off and made available for the trial without undue disturbance to other New South Wales Courts and criminal trials at the complex. My understanding however, was that the complex would need approximately $600,000 worth of work to be done to it to provide for appropriate modernisation. This work would have been especially in the area to address technology and security issues. My further understanding is that there were discussions between the New South Wales government and the Australian Attorney-General's Department with a view to seeking funding from Commonwealth sources for the purposes of transforming the Darlinghurst complex. This proposal did not reach fruition, however, because of an important intervening event.  
     
      
    11 The Department of Corrective Services, which had been involved in extensive discussions concerning the Darlinghurst Supreme Court as a possible venue, determined in late June 2007 that the Darlinghurst complex was simply unsuitable. This was said to be for a number of reasons, but especially those related to appropriate security arrangements. It soon became apparent that this decision was fixed in concrete, at least in political terms. Consequently, there appeared at that time to be no presently existing courtroom facility in New South Wales that would be appropriate and suitable for the proposed trial. 
     
      
    12 In June 2007, the New South Wales Government suggested that the Sydney West Trial Courts, when completed, might provide a suitable venue, indeed the only venue, which could be considered as an available option. 
     
      
    13 This decision was notified to the parties and it led to the preparation of a considerable number of submissions, not only from those representing the accused, but from the Crown and the Commonwealth Attorney-General as well. It seems that in mid-2007, no one was happy with the proposal to have the trial at Parramatta, save for the Government.  
     
      
       
      THE ISSUES IN THIS APPLICATION 
       
      
    14 In general, it must be said that many of the submissions that were received during the latter part of 2007 were anticipatory in their concerns. For example, detailed submissions were received from both Mr Button SC on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho and from the Crown Prosecutor. These submissions dealt with many of the anticipated shortcomings of the complex, even though it had not been completed at the time. 
     
      
    15 A principal concern for the defence was, as might be anticipated, the fact that a trial at Parramatta would prove most inconvenient, difficult and taxing for the lawyers involved because of the distance between Parramatta and Sydney CBD. There were secondary arguments advanced about the proposed courtroom and the Court complex itself. These included whether the courtroom would be big enough to hold all the defence lawyers and extended to possible concerns about the jury room, and the dock area. There were submissions about other parts of the complex which might impact upon the ability to interview the accused from time to time. I need not detail them all because, as I say, they were largely anticipatory and made assumptions based on the plans of the proposed premises then available. 
     
      
    16 The Crown submissions also focused upon a number of matters which I need not detail. They included, however, the absence of suitable witness rooms or conference rooms for use by the Crown and the defence. There was also a concern about the available area for the public. There were also concerns about the courtroom itself and whether it would be big enough to accommodate all of the lawyers. There were also submissions about storage areas and the jury rooms. The Crown shared the defence concerns about the distance between the Sydney CBD and Parramatta and the problems this would have for the lawyers.  
     
      
    17 The Commonwealth joined in a number of concerns that had been expressed by the Crown and defence lawyers.  
     
      
    18 It is fair to say that in addition to those I have mentioned, a number of the other defence counsel have made submissions, either in written or oral form, either late last year or earlier this year.  
     
      
       
      THE PRESENT POSITION 
       
      
    19 The Sydney West Trial Courts complex was officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales and the Attorney General on 20 February 2008, that is to say only a few days before the trial commenced. The building is not fully operational at the present time and the only trial proceeding there at the moment is the subject trial involving the present accused.  
     
      
    20 The trial venue is Court 5 on level 3. An associated courtroom on this floor (Court 6) is occupied by the Crown and used by it as a preparation and office area. This means that, in practical terms, the Supreme Court is, for the purposes of this trial, occupying the whole of level 3. It is on these floors that the two multi-accused Courts have been constructed. An area has been set-aside in the public areas adjacent to courtroom 5 which are used as offices by the lawyers for the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    21 On level 2, there is a very large area which provides facilities for defence counsel using the complex generally. This has, however, been given over entirely to the defence counsel in the present trial for the duration of the trial. It is a very large area. It is furnished in a modern and attractive style and is integrated with a significant range of modern facilities. There are nine offices, a number of defence workstations, interview areas and a general range of amenities. No other Court complex in New South Wales provides, so far as I am aware, facilities of this level and standard to defence counsel appearing in one multi-accused trial. Indeed, there would be no court complex anywhere in the State offering this level of facility. Not surprisingly, for these reasons, the anticipatory submissions querying the suitability of the proposed complex for defence counsel have, in effect, been abandoned in the present change of venue application.  
     
      
    22 So far as the jury rooms are concerned, they, of course, will not be occupied until after a jury is empanelled. This is many months away. There will be the opportunity, from time to time, to reflect upon whether any changes are needed to the jury room or their facilities to ensure that they are suitable for a lengthy trial. There are in hand, already, proposals for the addition of suitable storage facilities in the jury room to make sure that the extensive number of folders that will be given to the jury may be kept by them in a secure and orderly way in the jury room itself.  
     
      
    23 I should add that the proposal is that the jury will not only use the one jury room on level 3, but the second jury room will be made available for their use as a recreational area and to provide them with a break-out area when they are not deliberating on matters relating to the trial. I have no doubt that some further improvements may have to be made to the jury facilities, but there will be ample time to consider these as the weeks and months pass.  
     
      
    24 Overall, the Court complex is extremely impressive. The level of finishes it possesses, the services it is to provide and its extensive range of amenities make it, plainly enough, a most attractive and efficient Court complex. This is not to say that, like all new buildings, it does not or will not have teething problems. They may need to be addressed as they arise from time to time. But as I say, it is a most attractive and efficient complex. It is fully air-conditioned, it is light and airy and it is clear that considerable professional care has gone into its planning and detail.  
     
      
       
      THE PRESENT SUBMISSIONS AS TO UNSUITABILITY OF VENUE 
       
      
    25 As I have indicated, the list of complaints regarding the complex have altered and substantially diminished since the submissions were filed late last year. This is quite understandable, as all the parties have now had an opportunity of looking at the complex in operational detail. 
     
      
    26 I leave to one side for the moment the overarching issue about the problems arising from the fact that the complex is situated at Parramatta at a considerable distance from the Sydney CBD.  
     
      
    27 The current concerns are best appreciated from the written submissions which have been filed on behalf of Mr Turnbull SC on behalf of his client, Mr Mulahalilovic. These concerns were supported in oral submissions by other counsel. There is no need for me to set out each and every matter, but I will mention those that seem to me to be the principal matters. Once again, I leave to one side the issue regarding the contest between Parramatta and Sydney as the appropriate venue. 
     
      
    28 The principal matters are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The inadequacy of the courtroom to cater for the number of lawyers, their working materials and the like. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The dock accommodation is said to be inconvenient and prejudicial. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The present hours of access to the Court (7am to 5pm on weekdays and no access on weekends) will compound the difficulties involved for preparation and work out of Court. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The jury box has fourteen seats, when fifteen will be required once the jury is empanelled. The rear row in the jury box is cramped. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Issues regarding the relevant software to be used remain undetermined and the Court Complex computer system may not be adequately enabled. 
        
       
      
    29 I do not suggest that these are the only matters that have been raised, but they give the flavour of the issues to be determined.  
     
      
       
      RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES 
       
      
    30 When the trial commenced on 25 February 2008, as might be anticipated, the Courtroom was on that day at bursting point. Not only were all the legal teams for the accused present, there were also present multiple legal teams for the New South Wales Police, the New South Wales Crime Commission, the Federal Police and the Commonwealth. In addition, there were legal representatives for the media interests and others I need not mention. There was a considerable number of members of the public, well beyond the friends, families and supporters of the accused. In addition, there were many media representatives present on that morning. There simply were not enough seats for everybody to be seated on that occasion and, for that reason, I invited a number of the lawyers to sit in the jury box facility, a suggestion readily accepted.  
     
      
    31 It needs to be stressed that the position on that first morning was well out of the ordinary. It would not represent the situation on a normal Court day. On the other hand, there was no jury present and the extra seats that were necessary on that day would not be available for the lawyers when the jury is sitting.  
     
      
    32 My assessment of the courtroom is that it currently can seat approximately thirty-two lawyers. I am told that a reasonable estimate of the number of lawyers who would need to be accommodated, were they all present at one and the same time, is in the order of forty or so. For that reason, I have, after consultation with and on behalf of the lawyers, made preliminary arrangements for a possible alteration to the layout of the courtroom to accommodate some twelve further persons in the legal body of the Court. This will necessarily mean that there will be some degree of cramping between the Bar tables that will then be configured within the well of the Court. But at least everybody will have a seat and there will be no need to use the jury facilities.  
     
      
    33 In fairness to those who have favoured the complex as a suitable venue, I should say that it was probably never contemplated that there would be as many lawyers involved in the trial as is now the obvious position. By way of contrast, in a current Melbourne trial involving twelve men accused of terrorism offences, there are approximately thirty lawyers involved at any one time. Here, as I have said, we are looking at over forty seats to accommodate lawyers in a nine-person trial. 
     
      
    34 The proposal to alter the courtroom accommodation is one that could possibly be implemented at reasonably short notice, and over about a week. A detailed assessment of the proposal is currently being undertaken by those responsible for the building work and the building itself. This proposal does not affect the seating for the public at the rear of the Court. There has always been relatively limited public seating. There are approximately thirty-two seats for the public at the rear of the Court. It is proposed, however, that monitor screens will be located in the public area outside the courtroom which will enable members of the public, if they wish, to see and hear what is happening in the courtroom during open Court sessions. This area is attractively furnished and is open, light and airy. It can accommodate a reasonable number of people. It should be operational shortly. 
     
      
    35 It is also proposed that there be a separate room in the complex made available exclusively for the media, where media representatives may, on screens, see and hear all that is happening in the courtroom during open Court sessions. They will have facilities or the ability to use modern technology to relay information that is newsworthy or which merits prompt media facilitation to the public. 
     
      
    36 I turn now to consider the jury box facilities. A copy of the plan shows that there is in fact provision for fifteen jurors, although this may not have been apparent to counsel at the time of their inspection. This was because one seat at the end, closest to the witness stand, is to be a movable seat made available for a disabled person, should a disabled person be selected for the jury panel. It is for this reason also that there is more room in the front row of the jury box than the rear row. The rear row, however, has a distance of one metre between the rear of the seat and the bench in front. I understand this to be the standard situation with all jury boxes in New South Wales. True it is that the jury box, in this regard, might be made a little more comfortable but that is something to which further thought can be given as the weeks and months pass.  
     
      
    37 The issue regarding the use of computers and software both in the courtroom and the preparation areas for the lawyers is one that is undergoing consideration at the present time. I do not think that I am in a position to make any final comment about this issue. I have urged the parties to confer in connection with it. I can say that from my inspection of the premises and of the plans, this courtroom is singularly well equipped to enable the adaption of cabling to any necessary computer system. I would be very surprised if this issue cannot be resolved favourably and, clearly, its resolution will help overcome the fact that the courtroom could not, as indeed no courtroom could, accommodate all the folders, exhibits, et cetera, that will be part and parcel of the working base of the trial. The selection of an appropriate computer system or methodology could also be linked to the defence preparation area, and, subject to issues of national security, to their Sydney chambers. 
     
      
    38 In relation to issues involving the dock area, I have indicated that these should be addressed separately from the present application. It involves issues and concerns about which I would need to get evidence, submissions and input from all interested parties, including the Sheriff’s Department and the Department of Corrective Services. There are some real issues to be considered in this area, but it is inappropriate for me to address them in this decision and at this time.  
     
      
    39 This brings me finally to consider the Sydney versus Parramatta argument. Mr Button put submissions which encapsulate, I think, the views of others. He submitted that the fact that thirty-five or so Sydney-based lawyers were shuffling back and forth between the city and Parramatta remains a profoundly inconvenient situation, notwithstanding undeniable objective improvements in the building itself from those contemplated late last year. Secondly, he submitted that these movements between the city and Parramatta were expensive and would undoubtedly extend the length of the trial.  
     
      
    40 There were submissions to like effect in the affidavit of Mr Houda.  
     
      
    41 Mr Turnbull complained that predominantly Sydney-based lawyers had been retained prior to Parramatta being chosen as the trial venue. The balance of convenience in a case with security requirements and voluminous materials, he argued, falls on the side of proximity to the workplace of those lawyers.  
     
      
    42 I accept without reservation that it is quite inconvenient for Sydney counsel to have to trek back and forth from Sydney to Parramatta each day and that it carries with it problems for preparation and trial work once the trial is underway. Of course, access to most Courts is limited after 5pm and would not generally be available to counsel on weekends. However, in most situations the courtroom will be much closer to the offices or chambers of the legal representatives than is the situation here.  
     
      
    43 The Court complex at the present time is not as yet fully operational and will not be so until the end of March 2008. At that time, as I understand it, four District Court Judges will take up residence and will use Courts on levels other than those I have identified. The registry staff will move in to the complex and the Court building will take upon itself the aspect of a busy Court centre. When that happens, I am hopeful that a slightly better arrangement for access may be negotiated, although it may not be as extensive as counsel would like.  
     
      
    44 While I accept the complaints that have been made about the situation of the trial being held at Parramatta, rather than at Sydney, I do not think that this warrants the grant of the application for change of venue.  
     
      
    45 A realistic appraisal of the situation must, I think, make it apparent that there is probably no Court complex in Sydney that can offer the facilities that are presently available, being facilities with the level of modernisation I have mentioned that exist in the Parramatta Court complex. There was always the prospect that Darlinghurst might be modernised, but it is clear that that could only be done at very considerable expense and, in any event, it did, rightly or wrongly, not meet with the approval of the Department of Corrective Services. The Downing Centre was, for reasons I have already indicated, always unsuitable for this trial. It remains unsuitable for that purpose.  
     
      
    46 I have the greatest sympathy for counsel, and all of the lawyers, for the inconvenience involved in the situation that arises because of the distance of the Parramatta complex from the Sydney Central Business District. Obviously enough, it affects myself and my staff, the Court Reporters and some of the Court Officers as well. On the other hand, the accuseds’ position at Silverwater places them in relatively close proximity to the Parramatta complex, which may be an advantage from the point of view of interviews and the like.  
     
      
    47 In an ideal world, a large-scale purpose-built Court complex close to the lawyers' rooms could perhaps be built on some extensive site in or near the Central Business District, if such a site could be located. But, in the real world, this complex at Parramatta is the best we can do in all the circumstances. It is, I should add, a very fine complex with many attractive and useful features. In my view, many of the problems that have been adverted to, such as the lack of accommodation in the courtroom, are capable of being addressed in the long run. As to the distance between Sydney and Parramatta, I am afraid that we will all have to put up with that inconvenience and do the best we can.  
     
      
    48 In all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any risk that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot be had in relation to the present venue. Nor am I satisfied that any other reason has been established to make it expedient to change the venue. Of course, I accept that there will be issues from time to time regarding the Court complex, the facility generally, and I will endeavour to deal with those promptly and sympathetically as they arise.  
     
      
    49 The application for change of venue is refused.

S FOR J U D G m
--------
- The  appellants  instituted proceedings  in  this Court 

reeking  judicial  review  under  the  .-ative 
I Rev*) 
Act  1977  of  decisions  by  a  Justice  of  the 
Peace to grant two search warrants under a. 10( 1) of the Crimea 

Decisipna 

1914.  The  warrants  were  granted  by  the  Justice  of  the 

Peace,  the fourth respondent,  on the Information of  the  first 

respondent,  an  officer  of  the  Australian  Customs  Service 

(""ACS""). 

The  second  respondent  is  another  Customs  officer. 

The  fifth  respondents  are  members  of  the  Australian  Federal 

Police  to  whom  the  warrants  were  addressed. 

The  first 

appellant  is Lego Australia  Pty Limited  (""Lego Australia""),  a 

ccuupany engaged  in the importation  into,  and  distribution  in, 

Australia  of  toy  building  materials. 

The  second  appellants 

are  a  firm  of  accountants  who  formerly  carried  on  business 

under  the name Ernst and Whinney  and now do so under the name 

Ernst and Young.  This  firm acted on behalf  of Lego Australia 

in connection with  the assessment of  customs  duty on imported 

goods . 

At  first instance, the appellants'  case was that,  in 

applying for the warrants, Mr.  Paraggio, the first respondent, 

failed  to  disclose  to Ms.  Elder,  the  fourth  respondent,  the 

Justice  of  the  Peace,  the  material  matters  of  which  Mr. 

Paraggio  was  aware,  or  ought  to  have  been  aware,  and  made 

statements  that  were  false  or  misleading; 

and  that  this
--------
conduct breached the duty imposed upon a person applying for a 

search  warrant  under  S. lO(1)  of  the 

with  the 

consequence,  it  was  said,  that  the  warrants  were  invalid. 

The appellants further contended that Ms.  Elder's  decisions to 

imaue  the  warrants  were  decisions  of  an  administrative 

character and that there was no evidence to justify the making 

of  either  decision; 

alternatively,  they  claimed  that,  in 

making  the  decisions,  Ms.  Elder  failed  to  take  into  account 

relevant  considerations,  took irrelevant considerations into 

account,  and  exercised  her  power  so  unreasonably  that  no 

reasonable person could have so exercised the power. 

Wilcox  J.  dismissed  the  application  (see  Laqp 
m Ptv. Ltd.  v Paraoaio  (1993) 44 FCR 151).  This is an 
appeal from that order. 

Section lO(1) of the Crimes provides as follows: 

""10.  (1)  If a Magistrate or Justice of the Peace 
im  satisfied by  information  on  oath  that  there  is 
reasonable ground for suspecting that there is in or 

upon any premises ... or placer 

(a)  anything  with  respect  to  which  any  offence 

against any law of the Commonwealth. . . has been, 

or is suspected on  reasonable  grounds  to  have 
been,  conmri tted; 

(b)  anything  as  to  which  there  are  reasonable 
grounds  for  believing  that  it  will  afford 
evidence  as  to  the  commission  of  any  such 
offence;  or
--------
. . . the Magistrate or Justice of the Peace may  grant 
the warrant. . . to enter at any time the premises. . .or 

a search  warrant authorising any constable named  in 

place  named  or  described  in  the  warrant,  and  to 
seise  any  such  thing  which  he  or  she  might  find 
there. "" 

(It may  be  noted  that, although 6.10  was recently repealed by 
the 
&&  1994, the new  legislation does not apply here.) 

f~e-3- 

The decision  to  issue  the warrants was  based  on  an 

Information sworn by  Mr.  Paraggio on 28 October 1991.  In  the 

Information,  Mr.  Paraggio  made  statements  to  the  following 

effect: 

( 1 )   There were  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting that there 

were  on  the  premises  of Lego  Australia  or  of  Ernst  &  Young 

certain  things,  including  price  lists,  coneignment  advices, 

ahipping and other documents, which related to the purchase of 

toy products by  Lego Australia  from Lego Overseas A/S,  Denmark 

(*Leg0 Overseasw) and  to  their  importation  into,  and  sale 

within, Australia by  Lego Australia. 

( 2 )   There were  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  these 

documents  will  afford  evidence  as  to  the  commission  of  the 

following  offences which were  suspected  on  reasonable grounds 

to have been committed: 

""(a) Between  December  1977  and  January  1988  L e p

imported by  it  into Australia  were imported on 
consignment and not  pursuant  to a  contract  for

In May  and  July  1989,  following upon the review  by  ACS,

""13. On  19  May  1989  Customs  advised  Lego  Australia

of customs valuation was to be discontinued and 
that from  1 June  1989  imported  'Lego'  products 
were  to be  valued  on  the basis  of  adjustments

above  resulted  in  Lego  Australia  Pty  Limited 
paying  a  lesser  amount  of  customs duty  on  its 
imports than it  was obliged to do.  The former 
employee  says  that  when  he  expressed  disquiet 
about  this  situation  he  was  told  by  his 
immediate  supervisor,  Mr  Geoff  Moore,  who  was 
and  is  the  financial  controller  of  Lego 
Australia  Pty Limited,  that he  was employed  to 
implement policy  and  that  was  all  that  should 
concern him.  He further s a p  that in late 1987 
Ernst  and  Whinney  alerted  Lego  Australia  Pty 
Limited  to  the  proposed  new  audit  powers  of 
Customs  and  that,  as  a  consequence,  Lego 
Australia  Pty  Limited  then  abandoned  its 
previous actual purchase  arrangements with Lego 
Overseas A/S  and,  on  the  advice  of  Ernst  and 
Whinney, restructured its overseas ordering and 
payment system."" 

( 9 )   The  balance  of  the  Information dealt  with  the possible 

location of  documents. 

A copy of  the warrant which related to premises at Lane 

Cove dated  30  October  1991, is  annexed  to these reasons.  The 

other warrant was  in  similar terms.  I t  will  be  seen that  in 

the  warrant,  the  justice  stated  that  she  was  satisfied  by 

information on oath placed  before  her  on that date that there 

were reasonable grounds for suspecting that there were, at the 

places  specified,  certain  things  which  satisfied  the  three 

conditions  there  described.  The  first  condition  related  to 

documents  of  the kind  there  specified,  including  price  lists 

and  shipping  and  other  documents. 

The  second  condition 

related  to the acquisition of  toy products  by  Lego  Australia 

from Lego Overseas or  their importation into, or  sale within,
--------
Australia.  The  third  condition referred  to  the existence of 

reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  the  things  to  be 

mearched  for  would  afford evidence  as  to  the  commission  of 

either or both the offences against s.29A  or 29D of the 
m.  The  warrant  authorised  entry  to  seize  things  which 
matisfied these three conditions. 

The  reasons given  by  Wilcox  J.  for  refusing  relief 

may  be mumnarised as follows:- 

(1)  His  Honour  first  analysed,  at  some  length,  the evidence 

with  respect  to  Lego  Australia's  dealings  with  ACS  in  the 

period  between  1977  and  1981. 

After  considering  the 

amendments  made  to  the  -toms 

Act  in  1981  picking  up  the 

international  agreement  known  as  ""Customs  Valuation  GATT 

Agreement*, his Honour said  (at 158): 

But,  o f   course,

(2)  Wilcox  J.  then  described,  also  in  some  detail,  the 

evidence as to the dealings between Lego Australia  and ACS  in
--------
the  period  1981-1988,  before  describing  the  evidence  in 

respect  of  the  dispute  which  developed  between  them  and  the 

subsequent conduct of the field audit in May  1990. 

(3)  The  primary  Judge  approached  the  present  matter  by 

classifying  the  information  in  question  into  two  groups:  (1) 

information said to be actually known to Mr.  Paraggio, but  not 

disclosed to Ms.  Elder;  (2) information not actually known by 

Paraggio,  but  which  he  should  have  known.

decision  in -8

(4)  Turning next to the complaint that Mx.  Paraggio  failed to 

disclose  to  Ms.  Elder  information  of  which  he  was  actually 

aware,  being  matters  discussed  at  a  meeting  between  Messre. 

Dunner  and  Paraggio  in  October  1991,  to which  reference  will 

be made later, his Honour said  (at 175-6): 

""The  c a s e   put  by  counsel  for  the  a p p l i c a n t s   on  this 
a s p e c t   o f   the  m a t t e r   i s   t h a t   Mr  Dunner  informed  Mr

--------
I do not  know  what m  Paraggio  would  gain by  doing 
this.  More lmprtantly, I cannot reconcile this 
Paraggio . 
8ugpt3ted course of conduct with my assessment of Mr 
I  was  favourably  impressed  with  Mr 
Paraggio,  from  his  performance  in  the witness box. 
He  seemed  to  me  an  honest,  fair-minded  and 
reaaonable person.  He  is  obviously a dedicated and 
conscientious  Customs  officer. 
No  doubt,  like 
everyvne else, he is capable of error, but  I believe 
that he attempted to carry out this investigation in 
a  fair and professional manner.  I cannot attribute 
to  hlm  the  deviousness  that  this  submi8sion 
entails. "" 

( 5 )   Wilcox  J.  went  on  to  reject  a  complaint  of  failure  to 

di6clome other  matters  and  of  misrepresentation  in  the  same, 

other grounds  for  judicial review  of  Ms.  Elder's  decision was 

or related, areas.  Finally, his  Honour  held  that none of  the 

in the instant circumstances, made out. - Summarily  stated,  in  their  grounds  of  appeal,  the 

appellant6  now  seek to challenge, in  their essential  aspects, 

the conclusions and reasoning of  the primary  Judge. 

ON THE A P P W  

It will  be  convenient  first  to consider  the general 

principles  in  this area and  then to apply  those principles  in 

the present circumstances. 

( a )  ElhPf were the -cable

leaal p y n c l ~ l e s  

( i )  T h e i ~ l e s  in Rockett 'S Case 

In  our  opinion,  the  question  for  decision  is  entirely 

one of  statutory construction, that is, the true meaning of
--------
m.lO(1)  in the present context.  The principles of the general 

law  have  no  application  here.  The  relevant  principles  for 

preeent  purposes  were  stated by  the  High  Court  in  Bpckett'g 
m, above.  As  the High  Court  there pointed  out  (at 110), 
the legislation there considered was  in substantially the same 
t e r m  am  8.10  of the v .  

In w e t t ' s   Case, a stipendiary magistrate issued a 

mearch  warrant  under  the  Criminal  CO& 
complaint  of  a  police  officer . 

(Q.) on  the  sworn 

An  order  to  review  was 

obtained in the Supreme Court  under  the & & i c e s  Act  (Q.) to 

mhow caume why  the warrant  should not  be  reviewed.  On appeal 

from the Supreme Court, the High Court ordered that the order 

to  review  be  made  absolute.  The  High  Court  enunciated  the 

following propositions: 

(1)  The validity of a search warrant is necessarily dependent 

upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue.  In 

premcribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, 

the  legislature  had  sought  ""to  balance  the  need  for  an 

effective criminal  justice system against the need  to protect 

the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and 

property""  (at  110). 

Against  that  background,  to  insist  on 

mtrict  compliance with  the statutory conditions governing  the 

immue  of  search  warrants  ""is  simply  to  give  effect  to  the 

purpose of the legislation"" (at 111).
--------
(2)  The opening words of  the legislation -  ""If it  appears to 
a  justicen  (cf. Crimes  Act,  s.lO(1)  -  ""If  a  Magistrate  or 
Justice of the Peace is satisfied ..."") -  impose on the justice 
the  duty  of  satisfying  himself  that  the  conditions  for  the 

ismue of the warrant have been satisfied (at 111). 

(3)  ~lthough it  is  implicit  in  the  legislation  that  the 

applicant  for  the warrant  should  entertain the  suspicion and 

belief  to which  that  section refers,  it  must  ""appear"" to the 

jumtice that there are reasonable grounds for entertaining the 

relevant  suspicion  and  belief. 

The  requirement  that  facts 

exist which  are sufficient to induce this state of  mind  in a 

reasonable  person  opens  many  administrative  decisions  to 

judicial review and  precludes  the  arbitrary  exercise of  many 

statutory powers  (at 111-2). 

(4)  The  matters  which  must  be  made  to  appear  to  a  justice 

must  appear  ""on complaint made  on oath"".  If  the  information 

merely  contains  a  statement  that  the  deponent  suspects 

something,  for  which  suspicion  he  gives  no  relevant 

foundation,  the court  will  declare  that  there was  no  ground 

for  the  exercise  of  the  magistrate's  power  to  issue  the 

warrant.  The  requirement  is  that  the  sworn complaint  should 

contain sufficient facts to found the reasonable suspicion and 

the reasonable belief.  If  that requirement  is not  satisfied, 

the  information  otherwise  conveyed  to  the  justice  is 

hnaterial, but,  if that requirement is satisfied, the justice
--------
may seek confirmation by  inquiry of the complainant  (113-4). 

(There is no evidence in the present matter that any 

such .inquiry was made or was  necessary.  The  justice gave  no 

evidence;  it is common ground that she gave no  formal reasons 

for  her  decisions  to  grant  the  warrants;  that  being  so,  it 

should be  inferred that  her  reasons were  those  stated  in  the 

Information.) 

(5)  In  considering the  sufficiency  of  a  sworn complaint  to 

show reasonable grounds  for the suspicion and  belief  to which 

a  provision  such as  S. lO(1) of  the crimes  A c t   refers,  it  is 

necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  suspicion  and  belief  are 

different  states  of  mind  and  that  the  section  prescribes 

distinct  subject  matters  of  suspicion  on  the  one  hand  and 

belief on the other (at 115).  It  is by  reference to the means 

of  identification  of  the  object  of  the  search  that  the 

sufficiency  of  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  and  for 

believing,  must  be  judged  (at 117).  The  description  of  the 

object  of  the search  is  a reference point  for  delimiting  the 

ecope  of  the  warrant. 

The  wider  and  less  specific  the 

description  of  the  object,  the  wider  will  be  the  powers  of 

aeizure but  the more difficult will be the task of  persuading 

the  jumtice  that  there  are,  in  the  terms  of,  for  instance, 

s.lO(l)(b)  of  the  -S 

Act,  reasonable  grounds  for  belief

It is  clear that his Honour was exercising the basic 

common  law  discretion to exclude  unduly  prejudicial  material 

in  order  to ensure a  fair  criminal  trial  (see e.g.  EvidenceL

trial  Judge  was  whether  the  authority  of  the  administrative 

decision-maker  in  granting  the warrant  had  been  exercised  in 

accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.

not  be  done  unless  the subject  matter  of  the  suit

A  similar  approach  was  adopted  by  the  Court  of 

Appeal  of  the  Supreme Court  of  New  South Wales  in 

v 

(1993) 32 NSWLR 662 per Mahoney A.P. 

at 616-7. 

Again,  it  is clear that  these principles  have their 

source  in  the  general  law.  [See The Varnp  [l9931 2 Lloyd's 

Rep.  253;  and  see  M.S.  Dockray  ""Disclosure  and  Arrest  of 

Shipsn [l9941 110 L.Q.R.  3821 

(v)  Does an a D D U a n t  for a warrant under S. 10 11) of thg 

a ""dutv"" of disclosure? 

As  has been  said,  in our view,  the present  question 

is one of  statutory construction and  is not  to be resolved by 

reference  to  the  principles  of  the  general  law. 

In 

particular,  the  practice  in  equitable  jurisdictions  in  the 

grant  of  discretionary  relief,  e q  parte,  in  private  civil 

"" 

litigation does  not,  in  our  opinion,  provide  an  appropriate 

analogy here.  That  is  to  say,  in  our  opinion, the  instant 

matter  is to be  decided  in accordance with  the terms, express 

and  implied, of  the provisions  of  s.lO(1)  of  the w e s  Act,
--------
properly  construed.  Those  terms  are  relevantly  explained  in 

propositions  (1) to  ( 5 )   extracted  above  from Jlockett's  Case. 

nothing there suggests the existenceGof a  ""duty"" of disclosure 

in  the  informant,  breach  of  which  would  invalidate  the 

warrant.  Indeed  the existence of  such a  principle  would  be 

inconsistent with the approach taken in pockettee Casg.  Under 

that  approach,  attention  is  focussed  upon  the  role  of  the 

magistrate or  justice as  the administrative decision-maker  in 

accordance with principles of administrative law.  This may be 

contrasted  with  the  position  in  private  civil  litigation 

where,  if ex parte relief is sought, the conduct or misconduct 

of  the party  obtaining  the relief,  rather  than the decision- 

maker,  is  the  relevant  consideration.  Put  differently,  the 

present  question  is  one  of  public  or  administrative  law;  its 

resolution depends  upon  the characteristics of  the  action  of 

the decision-maker,  including the processes  adopted by  him  or 

her and,  in the extreme case of  ""unreasonablenessM, the nature 

of the outcome if perverse. 

It  is  true  that,  in  an  exceptional  case,  an 

administrative  decision  may  be  vitiated  by  fraud  or 

misrepresentation  even  at  connoon  law  (see, e.g.  Sir  William 
The W \  Act 

Wade,  -tive 
itself  makes  such  a  provision  -  see  s.5(1) (g). 
special  situation,  it  will  be  necessary  to  consider  the 

Igar,  6th  ed.qat  257). 

In  that 

conduct of  the party making  application  for an administrative 

decision.  But,  generally  speaking,  the role of  the court  in
--------
judicial  review  is  to  supervise  the  activities  of  the 

Executive  eo  as  to  ensure  that  administrative  action  takes 

place  in  accordance with  the  rule  &f  law.  This  supervisory 

jurimdiction is very  different in character from the function 

of  the  courts  in  determining  civil  disputes  between  private 

citizens.  In other words,  it  may  be  one  thing  to  apply  the 
v  Bullock  in  ordinary  civil 

principles  discussed  in 

litigation. 

It  is  another  to  seek  to  apply  them  in  an 

application  for  judicial  review  of  a  decision  to  grant  a 

warrant  where  the  statutory  authority  to  grant  the  warrant 

contemplates that the application for it will, necessarily, be 

made  ex parte,  yet  where  the statute also requires,  in  order 

to  protect  the  legitimate  interests  of  members  of  the 

community,  that  certain  conditions  be  fulfilled  before  the 

warrant may be granted. 

It  follows,  in  our view,  that  there  is  no  general, 

in the sense of  abstract,  ""duty"" of  disclosure here.  This  is 

not  to say  that  a warrant  should  not  be  set  aside,  as  other 

ahinietrative decisions can be,  where there has been  fraud or 

aaiarepreeentation.  For this purpose,  a statement which was  a 
half-truth  and  thus misleading  (see e.g.  B v Klvsant  [l9321  1 

KB 442) would  be  treated,  in this,,. as in other contexts, as a 

b 

mimrepresentation. 

Put  differently,  the  primary  question  here  is  not 

whether the  informant  was  under  an obligation  to  disclose to
--------
the  justice a particular  fact,  but  whether  the  statements  in 

the Information were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 

m. lO(1)  There  is  also  a  questio#  whether  the  decision  to 

grant the warrant was induced by  fraud.  It will be convenient 

to  consider  these  questions  separately.  The  first  question 

will be  considered  from the standpoint of what  appears on the 

face  of  the  Information,  that  is,  without  recourse  to  any 

extrinsic material.  However, the position  in the case of  the 

mecond  question  is  different. 

There,  since  fraud  or 

misrepresentation  is alleged,  it  will be  necessary to look at 

collateral  material  in  order  to  ascertain  whether  any 

reprementation by  the Informant was, when measured against the 

objective circumstances, false. 

fQE the Durwses of s.lOll\ of the -6 

Act? 

Aa  has  been  said,  by  the  terms  of  s.lO(l)(b),  the 

justice had to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds 

for suspecting that there was,  upon  the nominated premises, a 

thing or things as to which there were reasonable grounds  for 

believing that it will afford evidence as to the commission of 

either of the two offences specified. 

k"" 

In  drawing  the  distinction  between  suspicion  and 

belief,  the  Court  said  in  Bp ckett'e  Caee 

(at  115)  that 

suspicion is  ""a state of conjecture or surmise where proof  is 

lacking"".  The  Court  went  on to  say  (at 115) that  the  facts
--------
which  can  reasonably  ground  a  suspicion  may  be  quite 

insufficient reasonably  to  ground  a  belief,  yet  some  factual 

basis  for  the  suspicion  must  be  khown. 

However,  in  the 

present case, as i n - m t t ' s  Case (at 119.),  the real question 

for determination is not whether there were reasonable grounds 

for suspecting that the described classes of documents were on 

the  specified  premises,  but  whether  there  was  sufficient 

material  in the Information to satisfy the justice that there 

orere  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  those  documents 

will,  in the language of  the statute,  ""afford evidence as  to 

the commission of"" either of the two offences. 

In  our  opinion,  taken on  its  face,  the material  in 

the  Information was  sufficient  so  as  to  satisfy  the  justice. 

It is,  as has been noted,  a separate question to be dealt with 

later, whether the decision to grant the warrants was vitiated 

by  the fraud  of  the informant.  But,  in the absence of  proof 

of  fraud,  the  material  in  the  Information,  in  our  view, 

satisfied the conditions specified in s.lO(l)(b). 

In Bpckett's  W, the High Court, referring to the 

consideration  in 

v 

phrase  ""will  afford  evidence  as  *o  the  commission  of  [an] 

(1983) 153  CLR  52  of  the 
-. 
offence"" appearing  in  8.10  of  the -8 

Act&  said  (at 119- 

2 0 )  : 

"". . .the case does  not  suggest  that  the  only  things 

for  which  a  search  warrant  might  be  issued  are 
things  which  are  or  will  become  admissible  in
--------
evidence.  The power  to issue a search warrant is in 
aid  of  criminal  investigation as  well  as  in  aid  of 
proof  at  the trial,  though it  is necessary that the 
investi gati on  should  have  r e e e d   the  stage  where 
reasonable  grounds  for  the statutory  suspicion  and 
belief  can be  sworn  to.  An  object  will  answer  the 
.desripti on  in . par. (b)  if  there  are  reasonable 
grounds  for believing  that  it  will  assist  directly 
or indirectly in disclosing that an offence has been 
cammitted  or  in  establishing  or  revealing  the 
details  of  the offence,  the circumstances  in  which 
it  was  committed,  the  identity  of  the  person  or 
persons  who  committed  it  or  any  other  information 
material  to the investi gation of those matters. "" 

In  W e t t ' s  W,  it  was  held  (at 120)  that  the 

eworn complaint was  inadequate  to found a conclusion that the 

identified  bundle  of  documents  would,  if  found,  actually 

contain  eome  statement  or  statements  which  were  relevant  to 

the  commieeion  of  one  or  other  of  the  alleged  offences. 

Contaequently,  the  complaint  was  inadequate  to  found  the 

magistrate's  conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for 

""believing"" that  the designated  objects  of  the search would, 

if  found, afford evidence as  to the commission of  an of fence. 

I t   followed that the terms of  the warrant were not  supported 

by  the  sworn  material  placed  before  the  magistrate. 

Accordingly,  the  grant  of  the  warrant  was  beyond  power  and 

invalid. 

In  the  present  case,  thQT: requisite  ingredients  of 

the  offences  alleged  in  the  Information  were: 

( a )  that  a 

repreeentation  was  made  that  the  products  purchased  were 

received on a consignment basis;  ( b )  that the representation 

was  false;  (c) that, as  a consequence of  the making  of  the
--------
representation, ACS  allowed  duty  to  be  paid  at  a  rate  which 

warn  lower than would otherwise have been paid;  (d) that there 

was  an intent to defraud.  It  willt;be convenient to consider 

these  in  turn. 

For  this  purpose,  as  has  Deen  said,  the 

question to be  addressed will  be  considered  by  having  regard 

to the material  in the Information taken on its face, so that, 

for  immediate  purposes,  it  will  not  be  appropriate  to  look 

beyond, or behind, the statements made in the Information.  As 

has  been  said,  different  considerations  will,  however,  arise 

at  the  next  stage  when  dealing  with  the  claim  that  the 

decisions  to grant  the warrants  were  induced by  the  fraud  of 

ACS. 

In that  context,  it may  be  necessary to have regard  to 

extrinsic or collateral material  other than the statements in 

the  Information.  In  considering  the  primary  question  to  be 

addressed, it  is proposed  to look only at  the material  in the 

Information.  This will be done, not only to determine whether 

(L)  the  material  provides  an  adequate  basis  to  justify  the 

holding  by  the  justice,  on grounds  that were  reasonable,  the 

belief  that the objects of  the search will  afford evidence of 

the commission of the offences alleged;  but  also to determine 

whether (ii) (in the sense explained in pockett's  Casg at  111- 

2 ) ,   80  far as material,  any of  the grounds of  judicial review 

relied upon  (i.e. no evidence;  unr$asonableness  ;  taking into 

account  irrelevant  considerations; 

and  failure  to  take 

relevant  coneiderations  into  account)  are  made  out. 

When 

reference is  now made  to the  ""sufficiency"", or otherwise,  of 

the  Information,  it  is  intended  to pick  up  both  of  (i) and
--------
(1) 1 J 

o  the  alleaed  rewresentation that  the  row

ed were received on a c-

AB  has  been  seen,  it  was  stated  in  para.9  of  the 

Information  that  Lego  Australia  represented  that  the  goods 

""-re 

imported on consignment and  not  pursuant  to contract of 

sale"".  Whilst  this statement was expressed  in general terms, 

perhaps  as  a  conclusion,  there  was  specific  material  in  the 

Information in this regard as follows: 

(A)  Reference  was  made  in  para.11  to  Ernst  and  Whinney's 

letter dated  18 January  1988,  in response to a  request  for  a 

copy of  the consignment agreement, in which  it was  stated,  in 

effect,  that although there was  no  formal written consignment 

agreclment,  there was  in place  an  informal arrangement between 

the members of the Lego Group evidenced by  ""correspondence and 

conaignment  shipping  and  sales  documentation"";  and  that  a 

formal consignment agreement was  ""shortly"" to be entered into. 

(B) 

In  the  subsequent  correspondence  annexed  to  the 

Information, written by  Ernst and Whinney on 9 September 1988, 

19 December  1988,  13 January 1989 $nd  15 May  1989, references 

were made to stock being  ""consigned"";  to ""consignment stock""; 

to  ""consignment  operations"";  and  to  the  ""consignment 

arrangement"".
--------
( C )   Reference was made in the annexed letter written by Lego 
dated  30 May  1989  to  ""consignment stock"" and  to  ""consignment 

inventory"". 

4 

(D)  In Ernst  and Whinney's  letter dated  20 July  1989 annexed 

to  the  Information,  reference  is  made  to  stock  being 

""consigned"". 

(E)  The ACS  audit  report dated  14  June  1990 annexed  to the 

Information examined  ""consignment"" transactions  entered  into 

in  1989,  but  as  the  sunrmary  of  the  report,  set  out  above, 

indicated, the report also dealt with consignment transactions 

in earlier periods, going back as far as 1977. 

(P)  In  para.  21  of  the  Information,  reference  is  made  to 

matters  stated  by  the  former  employee  with  respect  to  ""the 

purported consignment arrangement"". 

In  our  opinion,  subject  to  one  qualification,  the 

foregoing  constituted  a  sufficient  statement  in  the 

Information of the facts and circtqtances relied on by ACS to 

eotablish  what  is  essentially  a  question  of  primary  fact, 

namely, that the alleged representation was made.

tv of the u~resent-7 

w i a  

The sumnary to the audit report dated  14 June 1990, 

annexed to the Information, indicated that only 60 per cent of 

the consignment price was  being  entered  for duty and  that the 

full  F.O.B.  price,  which  was  also  the  consignment  price, 

mhould  have been entered;  and  that, notwithstanding that ACS 

may  have  ""compromised  itself  as  a  result  of  previous 

decilrione...those  decisions were based on an incomplete set of 

documente and ae a result, a decision biased  in favour of Lego 

Aulrt.  P/L wae  obtained"".  Whilst  the audit  report  appears  to 

accept that the goods were shipped on a consignment basis, the 

allegations  of  the  former  employee  described  in  the 

Information  contradicted  this. 

It  is  there  stated  that, 

according to his information, the purchases were made pursuant 

to  an  agreed  export  price  list,  and  that  there  was  no 

conlrignment arrangement, that this has been the position since 
1977  (para.20);  that  two  sets  of  documents  -  one  for  ACS 
purpolrelr  and  the other  for  internal use  -  were  kept  and  not 
and  that  the 
revealed  to  ACS  until  the  audit  in  1990; 

documente  produced  to  ACS  did  not  reflect  ""the  commercial 

realityn (para.21). 

In  our  opinion,  this  material  is  a  sufficient 

lrtatement of what, again, is essentially a question of primary
--------
fact, namely, the falsity of the representation alleged. 

( 3 )   .~~  the  Infonaation con 
conaeauence of the 

wed dutv to be oaid at a lower rate? 

.  . 

tain  a  sufflclent s t a m e n t  that 

of the re~resentaCion. 

In para.22  of  the Information, it  is  stated, by  way 

of  a  conclusion,  that  the  use  of  dual  documentation  as 

previously  described  in  the  Information,  resulted  in  the 

paymnt  of  less  duty. 

There  was  other  material  in  the 

Information on  the  point. 

It  will  be  recalled  that  it  was 

stated  (in para.7)  that between  1976 and  1981, the m t o m s  Act 

provided  that  the  basic  measure  of  ""customs value"" was,  in 

effect,  the  market  price;  and  that  in  transactions not  at 

arms8  length,  the  price  fixed  by  the  parties  was  to  be 

adjusted  accordingly;  and  that  in  1981  the  legislation was 

amended  so  as  to  impose  duty  on  the  actual  or  ""transaction"" 

value,  that  is,  ""the actual  sale value of  the contract"".  As 

has  been  seen,  it  was  further stated  (in para.8)  that,  under 

both  valuation  systems,  in  the  case  of  a  consignment 

arrangement between exporter and importer,  ""customs value"" may 

be e~tablished on the basis of the sale of comparable goods or 

by  the  use  of  actual  or  expected  realisations,  known  until 

1981  as  the  ""end-realisation""  method  and  later  as  the 

., 

""deductive"" method, whereby the  ""customs value"" was calculated 

by  deducting certain allowable expenses  from the price of  the 

first  sale  after  importation  to  an  unrelated  buyer  in 

Australia.  As  has  been  noted,  the  Information  stated  (in
--------
para.9)  that  it  was  represented  that  importation  was  on  a 

conmignment  basis,  and  not  pursuant  to  a  contract  of  sale; 

and  that,  on  this  basis,  ACS  a$cepted  a  calculation  in 

accordance  with  the  ""end-realisation"",  and  later,  the 

*deductiveN, method.  Reference ie then made to the review (in 

para. 10)  and,  ultimately  (in  para. 15)  to  the  audit. 

The 

aummary  in  the  audit  report  annexed  to  the  Information  has 

already been mentioned.  As we have seen, it was there alleged 

that  only  60  per  cent  of  the  true  value  for  duty  had  been 

declared . 

When  these  statements  are  read  together  they 

explain,  adequately  in  our  opinion,  the assertion  that,  as  a 

conmequence of  its  representation, Lego Australia was  allowed 

by ACS  to pay less duty. 

(4)  Did  the  Infowtion contain  a  sufficient  s t atement  th& 

7 had the reauieite intent to d e w ?  

The  statement  in  para.21  of  the  Information of  the 

claim by  the former employee that Lego Australia  produced  two 

nets  of  documents  which  recorded  different  prices  for  each 

ahiplaent,  when  read  with  the  other  statements  in  the 

Information  and  its  annexures,  amounts,  we  think,  to  a 

muf f icient statement for this purpdie.
--------
For  those  reasons  we  have  concluded  that  the 

material  in  the  Information  was  sufficient  to  satisfy  the 

requirements of s.10(1), the question of fraud apart. 

. . 

Was  the  decision  to  m
of the Informant? 

t

 t b  

Lego Australia did not,  in terms, plead fraud in its 

amended  statement  of  claim. 

However,  as  appears  from  the 

pleading,  which  ia  annexed  to  these  reasons,  a  lack  of  good 

faith, a failure to speak where there was a duty to speak, and 

abuse of  office were  alleged.  For  present  purposes,  it  will 

be  necessary to examine these claims to ascertain whether,  in 

substance,  any  of  them  should be  treated  as  allegations  that 

ACS  and  the  Informant  misrepresented  the  position  to  the 

jumtice, at  least  in the sense that  it  ie  alleged  that  there 

wam  a statement of  a half-truth only and  that this misled  the 

jumtice into deciding to issue the warrant. 

It  will  now  be  necessary  to  refer  to  some  of  the 

detail  of  the history of  the dealings  between  the parties  as 

found by the primary Judge as followsc-

s

 between Leao and ACS:  1977 -  198a 

In  this  period,  several':  meetings  took  place  and 

correspondence  was  exchanged  between  the  parties,  on  the 

method of calculation of duty.  Mr.  Harold Dunner, then Senior 

Inmpector,  Appraisements,  in  the  Sydney  office  of  ACS,  was 

involved. 

(In February  1981,  Mr.  Dunner  resigned  from  ACS.
--------
He commenced  to act  as  a consultant  to Lego Australia  almost 

immediately  thereafter.)  The  ""End  Realisation  Method""  was 

discussed  and  a  modus  operandi  'was  apparently  agreed. 

However, Wilcox J. made this finding (at 154):

said (at 155):

t h e   goods  a t   the  t i m e   o f  importation."" 

In this period,  the parties exchanged correspondence 

with respect to the effect of the new legislation, the Gustorqa 

onsl  Amendment  AcC  1981.  The  ""deductive"" method  of 

determining  computed  value,  rather  than  the  end-realisation
--------
method,  was  discussed  in  correspondence  and  at  meetings 

between  representatives of the parties.  At  a meeting  held  on 

2  November  1987,  the  Lego  representatives  handed  over  a 

document  which  sought  to  explain  Lego's  ""calculation of  duty 

liability based on the deductive method"".  Reference was made, 

in  the  document,  to  ""the  consignment  agreement"". 

The  ACS 

officere  then  sought  a  copy  of  the consignment  agreement  and 

copierr of documents showing the money Lego sent to Denmark  for 

the goods.  The  Lego  representatives  refused  to supply  copies 

becauae  they  ""could  not  see  how  these  documents  would  have 

relevance""  (at 162). 

This  matter  was  taken  up  by  Ernst  and  Whinney  in 

their  letters  dated  18  January  and  9  September  1988  already 

mentioned.  Of the latter letter, Wilcox J.  said  (at 162-3):

In  1989, ACS  informed Lego  Australia  that the sales 

made by  Lego A/S to it were a sufficiently reliable indication 

of  value.  By  letter  dated  19  May  1989,  an  officer  of  ACS 

etatedr 

""I refer  to a  1977  arrangement between  your  company 
and  the  Australian  Customs  Service  whereby  Lego 
products  imported into Australia  from your  overseas 
parent  company would be  valued  for  c u s t m  purposes 
under  an  end-real isa tion  method. 
With  the 
introduction  of  the GATT  valuation  system  in  1981, 
this  arrangement  was  amended  to  allow  use  of  a 
flexible approach to the deductive method. 

Following a review of  the operation and importations 
of  your  company,  it  has  been  determined  that  this 
previously  agreed method  of  valuation  is  no  longer 
appropriate and future importations on and from June 
1  1989  should be  valued  by  a  flexible  approach  to 
the transaction value method  under Section 157(8) of 
the Customs Act. 

Given  that  there  is  a  known  price  which  your 
supplier  has  set  for  the  goods  at  the  time  of 
importation  and  the  first  sale  which  takes  place 
after importation is between  the two Lego companies, 
this  decision  is  entirely  consistent  with  the 
primary  aims of  GATT  ie to as  far as possible  value 
goods according to actual monies paid  in a sale."" 

However,  Lego  Australia  did  not  accept  this 

approach. 

In  May  1990,  as  we  have  seen, Mr.  Rooney  performed 

an  audit. 

Thereafter  ACS  demanaed  the  shortfall  in  duty 

previously  mentioned. 

Lego  Australia  appealed  to  the 

Administrative  Appeals  Tribunal. 

There  were  negotiations 

between  the  parties  which  were  suspended  pending  Lego 

Auetralia'm  application  for  a  tariff  concession  order.  None

In  June  1991,  ACS  obtained  an  opinion  from  an 

accounting  expert  to  the  effect  that  Lego  Australia's 

financial statements ""show stock in transit as assets and this 

is  evidence  of  ownership  . . .  and  that  the  goods  were  not 

imported on a consignment basis"". 

On  25  October  1991,  at  the  invitation  of  ACS,  Mr. 

Dunner  spoke  with  Mr.  Coates,  an  officer  in  the  ACS 

Investigation Section.  Mr.  Paraggio was  present  for  some of 

this time.  Ae  has  been  noted,  there was  a  conflict  in  the 

evidence of  Messrs.  Dunner  and  Paraggio which  his  Honour  (at 

175-6)  resolved  in  favour  of  Mr.  Paraggio  who  had  denied 

hearing from Mr.  Dunner that he  (Mr. Dunner) was  aware of  the 

existence  of  an  internal  price  list  or  that  Lego  Australia 

imported the goods pursuant to a contract of sale. 

( 1) Waer d = e i v e U v   fraud 
? 

- 

In  order  to  determine  whether  the  informant 

misrepresented  the  position  to  the  justice,  it  will  be 

convenient to refer to the material allegations in the amended 

statement of claim as follows:- 

(a)  In  para.24  of  the  amended  statement  of  claim,  it  is 

alleged  that  the  ACS  officers  ""well knew' that  ""neither the 

mere  non-existence  of  a  consignment  arrangement  nor  the 

existence of  a sale arrangement necessarily dictated that the
--------
end  realisation  method  or  the  deductive  method  was  not 

applicable"".  (See also para.25(c).) 

The difficulties in making out, in this area, a case 

of fraud on the decision-maker on the part  of the ACS officers 

are self-evident.  For one thing, the subject matter,  that is, 

the  course  of  dealings  within  the  Lego  Group,  was  something 

peculiarly within the knowledge of  the Group, et  least in the 

first instance.  Secondly, as the history of the matter  shows, 

thare  was  room  for  argument  about  the  true  complexion  or 

characterisation of the transactions under scrutiny.  Aa  well, 

complicated  and  contentious  legal  questions  were  involved. 

Given,  in particular,  the circumstance that the whole subject 

wan  argumentative  and  that,  even  after  the  field  audit, 

several points of view were open, even reasonably open, we are 

not  natisfied that  the serious charge of  fraud  has  been  made 

out in this respect, even if the facts alleged in para.24  were 

made out.  Moreover,  as has been noted, it was the case of the 

ACS  at  the  trial,  and  his  Honour  found,  that  in  the 

correspondence  written  to  the  ACS  there  had  been  several 

examples of a lack of candour on the part of the appellants in 

this regard. 

(b)  In para.25(g)  of  the  amended  statement  of  claim,  it  is 

alleged  that  the  ACS  officers  were  aware,  or  ought  to  have 

been  aware,  of  the matters  alleged  in  para. l0  thereof.  The 

allegations  in  para.10  address  the  dealing6  between  the
--------
parties  in  the  period  1978  to  1981.  Again,  essentially  for 

the  reasons  given  in  respect  of  the  allegations  made  in 

para.24,  we  are  not  satisfied  that,  in  this respect,  the ACS 

officers  knowingly  misrepresented  the  position  to  the 

decision-maker. 

(c)  By  para.25(b)  of  the  amended  statement  of  claim,  it  is 

alleged that the ACS officers knew,  or ought to have known, of 

the information alleged to have been provided by Mr. Dunner in 

the  interview  in  October  1991  (see para.21). 

AS  has  been 

mean,  him  Honour  found  that  Mr.  Paraggio's  evidence  of  the 

diacumsion was  the more  credible  version.  Again,  we  are  not 

matiafied  that  a  charge of  fraud  against  the officers  of  ACS 

could be suatained here. 

(d)  In  paras.  25(d),  (e),  (f),  (g),  (h) and  (i) of  the 

amended  statement  of  claim,  it  is  alleged  that  the  ACS 

officers  knew,  or ought  to have  known,  of  a  number of  pieces 

of  information. 

But,  even  if  the  allegations  could  be 

auatained as a matter  of  fact  (a difficult  task in the light 

of  the  trial  Judge's  findings),  it  would  not  follow,  in  our 

opinion,  that  the  statements  made  in  the  Information were  a 

miarepreeentation of the position in any material sense.
--------
It  follows,  in  our  view,  that  no  case  for  the 

judicial review  of  the  decision  to  grant  the warrant  on  the 

ground of fraud has been made out. 

In  the  reeult,  we  would  dismiss  the  appeal,  with 

I certify that this and the preceding 
forty-three  (43)  pages  are  a  true 
copy  of  the  Reasons  for  Judgment 
herein  of  their  Honours  Mr.  Justice 
Beaumont and Mr. Justice Whitlam.

--------
As  the  judgment in 

makes  clear the existence 

of the obligation to make  full disclosure was  not  the subject 

of  argument  in  the  appeal  in  that  case.  The  obligation  was 

accepted  by  the parties.  Nor  was  the  existence  of  any  such 

obligation  essential  to  the  decision  in  the  case,  for  the 

Court  found  that,  accepting  such  an  obligation,  it  had  not 

been  shown to have  been  breached.  It  is  accordingly open  to 

this  Full  Court  to  decide  for  itself  (without  the  usual 

strictures  of  following  previous  Full  Court  decisions  as  a 

natter  of  comity  unless  they  are  shown  to  be  clearly  wrong) 

whether  such  an obligation exists  and  if  so  the  consequences 
for the purposes of  judicial review of a breach of it.  Karina 

ham  been  followed since in a  number of  single judge decisions 
including  Freeman v 

(1992) 37  FCR  399,  per  Ryan  J; 

v m (1992) 39  FCR  201  per  French  J  and  in 
v v (1993) 66 A Crim R 337 per Cooper J. 

The  genesis  of  the  view  that  there  is  such  an 
obligation is to be found in the judgment of McGarvie J in B v 

[l9831  2  VR  133. 

In  that  case  a  listening  device, 

obtained  from a  Stipendiary Magistrate pursuant  to 6.4  of  the 
Lietenina 1969  (Vic), had  been  used  to listen to 
and  record  conversations  that  took  place  in  gaol  between  a 

person accused of murder and an acquaintance in a prison  cell 

in the gaol.  The evidence so obtained was  strongly probative 

of  the guilt  of  the  accused  and  application was  made  at  the 

trial  to reject  it.  The application for the warrant  for the
--------
listening device did not disclose that the accused had already 

been  charged with  murder  or  that  the  intention was  to  listen 

to  conversations  taking  place  between  the  accused  and  a  co- 

accused also in the same prison. 

As  the  joint  judgment  of  Beaumont  and  whitlam  JJ 

points  out,  the question before McGarvie J was  ultimately one 

of  discretion  to  exclude  the  evidence  of  the  cell  tapes. 

However,  the basis of the existence of that discretion was,  as 

the judgment makes clear, the claim that the evidence had been 
v m (1977-78) 141 CLR  54. 
The  warrant  was  defective  for  a  number  of  reasons.  However 

illegally  obtained:  cf 

among those reasons,  in his  Honour's  view,  was  the failure of 

the statement, upon which the issue of  the warrant was based, 

to disclose the fact that the accused had been  charged and the 

purpose  for which  the warrant was  intended.  His  Honour  left 

open  the  question  whether  that  failure  was  due  to  error  or 

design.  Having  regard to his  Honour's  view  that  the warrant 

was  defective, i n t e r   a l i a   on the basis that the statement had 

failed  to make  adequate  disclosure,  I  do  not  think  that  the 

case  can  easily  be  put  to  one  side  as  a  mere  exercise  of 

discretion.  It does not, of course, bind us. 

On  the  question  of  the  exercise  of  discretion 

McGarvie J said (at 150-1):
--------
'I  consider  that  substantial  weight  is  to 
be  accorded  to the fact  that the approvals 
from  the  Magistrates  were  obtained  on 
statements which  were prone  to mislead  as 
to  the  real  purpose  of  the  applications, 
and the fact  that the Magistrates were not 
informed  that  one  of  the  accused  whose 
conversations  were  to be  listened  to  had 
already  been  charged with  the murder.  On 
an  application  for  approval  there  is  a 
duty  to  bring  to  the  notice  of  the 
Magistrate  all  the  facts  material  to  the 
decision  to be  made.  This flows from  the 
fact  that  the application  for  approval  to 
a  course  which  affects  the  privacy  of 
others  and  which  would  in  the  absence  of 
the approval  be  forbidden  by  the statute, 
is made without the persons  to be  affected 
by  the approval  being  heard:  c f _ T h q m p S a  
v.  v. (1912), 15  C.L.R. 
679, at pp.  683-3, . . . Had  the Magistrates 
been  fully  and  correctly  informed  of  all 
the material  facts their decision may  have 
been  different. "" 

The reliance  upon Thomae v  Bul&.ck  was 
criticised  in  argument  as  inapposite  to  the  exercise  of  an 

administrative  diecretion  and  involving  an  area  of  discourse 

foreign  to the present  context.  ~t is  true that a Magistrate 
iesuing  a  warrant  under  6.10  of  the Crimes  1914  (Cth), 
like  a  judge  issuing  a  warrant  under  the Telecommunicatione 
Act  1979  (Cth) or  s.219B  of  the  Customs  Act 

1901  (Cth), ie  performing  an  administrative  rather  than  a 
judicial  function: m v  -v

--------
principle  has no application, particularly given the intrusive 

character  of  a  search warrant  and  its  impact on the right  to 

privacy.  The  eource  of  any  obligation  of  disclosure  and  the 

extent  of  that obligation must,  however,  be  found outside the 

area of diecourse of ex parte applications to a court. 

In my  opinion,  the source of  such obligation as may 

exiet  upon  an  informant  must  fall  to be  found,  as  the  Full 

Court  in 

observed,  both  in  the  nature  of  a  search 

warrant  (as a  etep  in an  investigatory process,  albeit  a  step 

which  authorises  an  invasion of  the common  law  rights  of  the 

citizen) and in the ex parte procedure which 6.10  specifies. 

The  process  under  s.10,  which  commences  with  an 

information  and  concludes  with  the  issue  of  a  warrant, 

requires there to be furnished to the Magistrate or Justice an 

""information on  oath"" which  is directed to the question  which 

the  Magistrate  or  Justice  must  decide,  namely  whether, 

relevant to the present case: 

""there is reasonable ground  for suspecting 

that  there is in or upon  any premises  . . . 

or places: 

(a)  anything  with  respect  to  which  any 
offence  against  any  law  of  the 

Commonwealth  . . .  has  been,  or  is 

suspected  on  reasonable  grounds  to 
have been,  committed; 

(b)  anything  as  to  which  there  are 
reasonable grounds for believing  that 
it  will  afford  evidence  as  to  the 

commission of any such offence;  . . . ""
--------
The  Magistrate  or  Justice  does  not  decide  whether 

anything of the nature described in the section in fact exists 

in or upon  the nominated premises,  nor does the Magistrate or 

Justice  determine  whether  any  nominated  offence  has  been 

committed.  The section is framed  in terms of  suspicion, even 

if,  ae  in  s.lO(l)(a), 

the  requisite  suspicion  must  be  ""on 

reasonable grounds"". 

In my view,  implicit in the obligation cast upon the 

Magistrate  or  Justice  to  determine  the  statutory  issue 

entrusted to that functionary must be,  at the very  least, some 

obligation of candour on the part of the informant.  It cannot 

be  the  case  that  an  informant  could  be  so  selective  of  the 

material  to  be  placed  before  the  Magistrate  or  Justice  as 

deliberately  to  lay  an  information  from  material  adverse  to 

the  person  whose  premises  are  to  be  searched  or  whose 

criminality  is  suspected,  neglecting  altogether  favourable 

material,  so as to secure the issue of the warrant. 

In my  view,  it  follows  from the restriction  imposed 

upon  the Magistrate  or  Justice  that  he  or  she be  confined  in 

deciding whether to issue a warrant to the information on oath 

furniehed by  the informant that that information can be relied 

upon  as  being  as  complete  as  the  then  investigatory  process 

may  permit. 

Equally,  however,  the  informant  will,  of 

necessity  in most  cases,  have to exercise an element of choice 

in determining what  information to place before the Magistrate
--------
or Justice.  Evidence held by the informant is likely to point 

in more than one direction.  The mere  fact that the informant 

may  inadvertently  omit  material  which  might  lead  to  a 

different  conclusion  on  the  part  of  the  Magistrate  would 

hardly  seem to constitute a breach  of the obligation which of 

necessity  ie placed upon the informant. 

Another  difficulty  is  that,  the  duty  of  the 

informant,  whatever  its  content,  may  be  a  duty  of  ""imperfect 

obligation"",  at  least  to  the  extent  that  failure  to  comply 

with  the  duty  may  not  give  rise  to  a  right  in  the  person 

against whom  the warrant  is to be  executed  in proceedings  for 

judicial review to have the warrant set aside. 

Ae  the  joint  judgment  of  Beaumont  and  Whitlam  JJ 

points out the preeent  case arises  in the context of  judicial 

review  and  more  precisely  in  the  context  of  an  application 

under  the -ve

 l Ju- 

Review) Act  1977 

(Cth)  (""the ADJR  Act"").  Under that Act,  one of the specified 

grounds in  s.S(l)  must  be made  out before the jurisdiction of 

the Court  to  reviev  an  administrative  decision  is  enlivened. 

Of  the  nine  grounds  listed  in  that  section  only  five  could 

have possible relevance.  These are: 

""(b)  that procedures  that were  required by 
law to be observed in  connection with 
the  making  of  the  decision  were  not 

observed;  ...
--------
that 
the  decision  was  not 
authorized  by  the  enactment  in

purported to be made; 

of  which 

it 

that  the making  of the  decision 
was  an  improper  exercise  of  the 
power conferred by  the enactment 
in  pursuance  of  which  it  was 

purported to be made;  ... 
affected by fraud;  . . . 

that  the decision was induced or 

that  the  decision  was  otherwise 
contrary to law."" 

(g) 

(1 

In many  cases which  fall  for decision by  this Court 

the decision-maker  is the head of  a government authority  or a 

delegate  of  that  person  and  the  decision  sought  to  be 

challenged  is made by  reference to information which  has  been 

placed  before  the decision-maker  taken  from  the  files  of  the 

authority.  In  such  a  case the Court  will  have  regard  to all 

the material held by  the authority in its files, not merely  to 

the  material  actually  placed  before  the  decision-maker  to 

determine,  for  example,  whether  the decision  was  an  improper 

exercise of power  (s.S(l)(e)) or as being  so unreasonable that 

no  reasonable  person  could  have  arrived  at  it  (s.5(2)(g)). 

Thus it was held in 
L; 
of (1986)  10  FCR  78  at  84  that  material  in  the 

v Peputv c 

. 

. 

Taxation  Office  file  must  be  regarded  as  available  to  the 

decieion-maker. 

The  present  case  is  different  because  the 

decision-maker  is  confined  to  a  consideration  of  material 

furnished by a third party informant.
--------
Does  it  then  follow  that  judicial  review  of  the 

decieion to issue a warrant must focus, in a case such as the 

present,  solely  upon  the  quality  of  the  decision  of  the 

Justice  or  Magistrate,  or  can  a  warrant  be  set  aside  by 

reference to the quality of  the act of  the informant in laying 

the information, such as failure to comply with the content of 

any obligation to make information available to the Justice or 

Magistrate? 

The leading High  Court authority  upon the issue of 

eearch  warrants  (the actual  legislation  under  consideration 

being  8.679  of  the 
Code  (Qld)  in  terms 
indistinguiehable for present purpose  from 6.10  of  the Crimes 
m) is m v 
a  judgment  delivered  by  all  justices  of  the  Court,  their 

(1990) 170 CLR 104.  In that case in 

Honoure said (at 110-111): 

""The  validity  of  such  a  warrant  is 
necessarily  dependent upon  the fulfilment 
of the conditions governing its issue.  In 
prescribing  conditions governing the issue 
of  search  warrants,  the  legislature  has 
sought  to  balance  the  need  for  an 
effective criminal justice  system  against 
the need  to  protect  the  individual  from 
arbitrary  invasions  of  his  privacy  and 

property. . . . 

Nevertheless,  in  construing  and  applying 
such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind 
that  they  authorize  the  invasion  of 
interests which the common law has  always 
valued highly and which, through the writ 
of  trespass, it  went  to great  lengths  to 
protect. 
Against  that  background,  the 
enactment  of  conditions  which  must  be 
fulfilled before  a  search  warrant  can be
--------
lawfully issued and executed is to be seen 
as  a  reflection  of  the  legislature's 
concern to give a measure of protection  to 
these  interests. 
To  insist  on  strict 
compliance  with  the  statutory  conditions 
governing  the  issue of search warrants  is 
simply  to  give  effect  to  the  purpose  of 
the .legislation. * 

The  emphasis  in  this  passage  upon  compliance  with 

the statutory conditions for iseue of a warrant  should not be 

read as confined to the formalities required to be included in 

the warrant,  the  existence of  an  ""information on  oath"",  the 

formation by  the  functionary of  the necessary  state of  mind, 

or the presence of material properly  before the justice which 

permits  that  state  of  mind  to  be  formed,  although  each  of 

these  statutory  conditions  must  be  complied  with. 

Simply 

because  the  Court  made  no  mention  of  the  need  for  the 

informant to exercise good faith in compiling the information, 

for example,  (if that  be  the relevant test) does  not  require 

the conclusion that  no  such obligation  existed.  That  is  not 

surprising because it was not in issue in that case. 

A  search warrant  is,  as Mason  J observed in Baker v 

(1983) 153  CLR  52  at  81,  quoting  from  Dickson  J  in 

(Nova S C O ~  

V 

(1982) 132 DLR  (3d) 

385  at  397,  ""part  of  the  investigative  pre-trial  process  of 

the  criminal  law,  often  employed  early  in  the  investigation 

and before the identity of all of the suspects is knownn.  For 

present purposes  the issue of a warrant  can be  seen to emerge 

from  what  the  High  Court  referred  to  in  the  passage  quoted
--------
of  m  as  an 
earlier  from  m  v  m  ~t-l 
""administrative process * .  If that process miscarries because, 

- 

for example,  the informant  has  produced  to  the Magistrate  on 

oath  what  purports  to  be  an  information  containing  material 

which  is  misleading,  or  omits  to  inform  a  magistrate  of  a 

matter which  is relevant to the decision which  the Magistrate 

has  to make  (at  least  when  that  omission  is made  other  than 

inadvertently) there is no reason in ordinary principle why  in 

an action for judicial review, whether under s.39B  or the ADJR 

Act  is not  presently  material,  the warrant  should  not  be  set 
In  such  a  case,  in  tenns  of  the  ADJR the 

aside. 

procedures  required  by  law  for  the  issue of  the warrant  will 

not  have  been  observed. 

This  will  be  so  because  the  law 

requires  at  the  very  minimum  that  the  information  on  oath 

furnished to the Magistrate or Justice not be misleading.  The 

resultant issue of the warrant will thus be contrary to law. 

In some cases  it may  be possible  to argue that what 

purports  to  be  an  ""information on  oath*  is  in  truth  not  an 

information  at  all. 

That  is  not  an  argument  made  in  the 

present case. 

The  ultimate  question  is  not  so  much  whether 

judicial review provides an appropriate remedy should there be 

a  failure  to comply  with  whatever  obligation  the  law  imposes 

upon  the  informant,  but  rather  what  is  the  content  of  that 

obligation.
--------
I  have  given  the matter  anxious  consideration.  In 

determining  what  obligation  the  law  requires  it  is  necessary 

to  balance  competing  policy  interests,  taking  into  account 

the place  of  a  search  warrant  in  the  investigatory  process, 

the  intrusive  nature  of  a  warrant  overriding  the  privacy  of 

the individual whose premises are to be the subject of search, 

the  fact  that  the  warrant  is  obtained  ex  parte  in  an 

administrative process and the nature of the question which  is 

to  be  determined  by  the  Magistrate  or  Justice  (acting 

judicially)  before  whom  the  issue  of  the  warrant  comes. 

Having  regard  to these matters  it  seems  to me  to  impose  too 

great an obligation upon the informant to say that the law  (in 

the present  case,  6.10)  implies  a  legal  obligation  to  place 

before  the  Magistrate  or  Justice  all  material  in  the 

possession  of  the  informant  or  known  to  the  informant  which 

might  bear  upon  the decision which  must  be  made.  The nature 

of  the  issue  to  be  determined,  one  of  suspicion  of  the 

existence  of  things  and  suspicion  or  belief  as  to  the 

committal  of  an  offence,  suggests  to  me  that  the  obligation 

could  not  be  intended  to  be  imposed  in  terms  of  objective 

criteria.  Thus  it  seems  to me  that  the obligation  should be 

stated  in  terms of  an  obligation  to ensure  that the material 

before the Magistrate or Justice is not  such as to mislead  and 

that any omission of  relevant material was  inadvertent.  This 

is  merely  another  way  of  saying  that  the  informant  must  in 

compiling the information act in ""good faith"".
--------
The power  to lay an  information before  a Magistrate 

or Justice  for  the issue of  a warrant,  like all powers,  must 

be  exercised  in  good  faith and  for the purpose  for which  the 

power was conferred.  If the informant does exercise the power 

in  good  faith  then  the  issue  of  the  warrant  can  not  be 

criticised  upon  the  basis  that  material  was  inadvertently 

excluded  from  the Magistrate's  attention.  Absent  good  faith 

upon the part of the informant the result will be different. 

The  question  does  not  seem  to  have  arisen  in  the 

United  Kingdom  or  New  Zealand. 

Fontana,  JA  in m 

in 

(3d ed,  1992) states the Canadian 

position  in  terms  similar  to  those  which  I  have  suggested 

above.  The learned author writes  (at 100-101): 

""Complete  honesty  by  the  informant  is  an 
essential  requirement  and  an  absence  of 
honest  disclosure  may  void  the  process. 
Not  only  must  the  contents  of  the 
information be  true but  the informant must 
not  omit,  colour  or  distort  material 
facts. "" 

The  cases  which  Fontana  cites  in  support  of  the 

above  proposition  are  all  cases  where  the  validity  of  the 

particular warrant  fell to be tested in the context of whether 

evidence  obtained  under  the  warrant  was  improperly  obtained 

and should be excluded.  However,  they all illustrate that the 

content  of  the  obligation  imposed  upon  an  informant  in  a
--------
context  similar  to  that  in  8.10  is  not  as  wide  as  that 
euggeeted in U. 

Thus  in  E v  Donaldeon  (1990) 58  CCC  (3d) 294,  a 

decieion  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  British  Colombia,  the 

informant  wae  found  to  have  practised  deception  by  stating 

that  certain  information  had  come  from  a  ""reliable 

confidential  source""  when  in  fact  it  had  come  from  an 

interception  of  a  private  conversation. 

In  the  result, 

evidence obtained under the warrant was not admitted. 

While the reference in Fontana to the obligation not 

to  *omitY might  suggest  a test  as  onerous  as that  in U, 
the author8e citation of  E v  Garofoli (1988) 41  CCC  (3d) 97 
(Ont  CA)  and  B  v  Falloncreet  (unreported  9 
November  1990, Ont Gen Div,  cited by  Fontana at  101, n67) make 

it  clear  that  ""inadvertent  omission""  (for  example,  brought 

about by haste) will not render a warrant invalid. 

Garofoli,  subsequent  to  the  writing  of  Fontana8s 

text,  came before the Supreme Court of  Canada and  is  reported 
as B v Garofoli (1991) 60 CCC  (3d) 161.  Although the actual 

decision  in  the  case  wae  overruled,  nothing  said  in  the 

judgments  affecte  the  use  made  of  that  case  by  Fontana. 

Sopinka J  (at 188), with whose reasons Dickson CJC,  Lamer CJC, 

La Forest and Gonthier JJ agreed,  referred to the grounds for 

reviewing the  ieeue  of  a  search  warrant  to  be  ""fraud,  non-
--------
disclosure,  misleading  evidence  and  new  evidence*. 
This 
comment,  although  made  by  reference  to  8.8  of  the  Canadian 
of m h Freedoms which  guarantees the right to be 
""secure against  unreasonable  search  or  seizure"" and  8.24  of 
which guarantees a remedy for breach of the -, 
my view,  not be irrelevant to the common law. 

would, in 

In  referring to the Canadian cases  I would  not  wish 

it to be thought that they were concerned with  judicial review 

as  such.  Each was  concerned with  the issue of  the reception 

of  evidence.  None  of  these cases  suggest a test  as broad  as 
that  adopted  in U. Further,  while  1non-disclosure8 is 

referred  to  in  a  number  of  the  Canadian  authorities,  it 

appears  that  this  is  in  the  context  of  deliberate  and  not 

inadvertent non-disclosure. 

I would  accordingly  hold  that  the obligation of  an 

informant for a warrant to make disclosure should be stated in 

terms of good faith and by  way of corollary, that a failure in 

good  faith  to disclose  material  relevant  to  the  issue  which 

the Magistrate  or  Justice  has  to  determine will  bring  about 

the result  that  the discretion  exercised  by  that  functionary 

to  issue  a  warrant  will  have  miscarried  by  virtue  that  the 

procedures  required by  law  for  the issue of  the warrant  will 

not have been observed.
--------
On  the  facts  of  the  present  case,  as  the  joint 

judgment of Beaumont  and Whitlam  JJ makes  clear,  the evidence 

does not support a conclusion that there has been a misleading 

omission,  (not being  a  merely  inadvertent  omission),  or  that 

there  has  been  bad  faith  on  the  part  of  the  informant. 

Although  the  issues  are  analysed  in  the  joint  judgment 

pursuant  to the criterion of  fraud,  to the extent  to which  a 

criterion  of  ""good  faith""  differs,  no  different  result  would 

obtain  here. 

In  the  result  I  too  would  dismiss  the  appeal 

with costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SULLY J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons prepared respectively by Dunford J and by Bell J. I need not repeat Dunford J’s canvass of the facts relevant to the appeal, and of the contending submissions that were put in connection with the appeal. 
      
       
     2 So far as concerns the first ground of appeal, I think that the process of reasoning that appears in paragraphs [39] – [44] inclusive is convincing. My own consideration of the matters of which his Honour speaks in those paragraphs has been influenced by the discussion which is to be found, in particular, in the judgment of Dawson J and McHugh J in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573. I note that Gaudron J and Toohey J published separately simple concurrences with the judgment of Dawson J. At 170 CLR 579,580 Dawson J says: 
      
       
        
         
         “As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury might quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof.  
         Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately. 
         ” 
          [emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     3 At 170 CLR 592, 593 McHugh J notes an observation of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Reg v Kilbourne [1973] A.C. 729 at 758 that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Circumstantial evidence ……… works by cumulatively, in geometrical progression, eliminating other possibilities.” 
         
        
       
     4 McHugh J then proceeds: 
      
       
        
         
         “If an inference guilt is open on the evidence, the question for the jury is whether the inference has been proved beyond reasonable doubt – not whether any particular fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Suppose on a charge of murder, the jury thought that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the murder weapon belonged to the accused and that he had a motive for killing the deceased, but the jury did not think that these two facts proved his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Suppose further, however, that the jury also thought that it had been proved on the balance of probabilities that the accused had been seen near the scene of the crime shortly prior to the murder and that he had been inexplicably absent from his employment for a period sufficient to enable him to kill the deceased. The inference that the accused, actuated by his motive, had used his weapon to kill the deceased would be greatly strengthened – probably beyond reasonable doubt – by the further probabilities that he had the opportunity to commit the murder, that he had been inexplicably absent from his employment and that he was in the vicinity of the murder scene at the time of death. Ordinarily, in a circumstantial evidence case, guilty is inferred from a number of circumstances – often numerous – which taken as a whole eliminate the hypothesis of innocence.  
         The cogency of the inference of guilt is derived from the cumulative weight of circumstances, not the quality of proof of each circumstance. 
         ” 
          [emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     5 I agree with Dunford J that the circumstantial case summarised by his Honour in paragraph [35] of his Honour’s judgment, constituted a strong circumstantial Crown case at trial. In my own opinion it was well open to the jury to find, on the evidence available at trial, that the appellant had been, at material times, in joint possession at the very least, of the weapons that were found secreted in the ceiling of his home. But even if the preferable view were to be that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied more than on the probabilities of that joint possession, then I do not see why such a view was not available to the jury in order to strengthen a conclusion that it might properly be inferred beyond reasonable doubt and from the cumulative effect of the other items of circumstantial evidence as summarised by Dunford J, that the appellant was guilty as charged. 
      
       
     6 I am mindful of the point made by Bell J in connection with the decision of this Court, (Street CJ, Slattery and Maxwell JJ), in R v Filippetti (1984) 13 A Crim R 335. I have re-read the report of that decision. At the heart of that decision, given ex tempore as it was, is, as I respectfully think, a very particular view of very particular facts. It is sufficient to cite the following passage from the judgment of Street CJ, with whom Slattery and Maxwell J simply concurred: 
      
       
        
         
         “The difficulty confronting the Crown in this case comes from the large number of persons occupying this comparatively small house and all using the lounge room where the budda sticks were found. …… The finding of the budda sticks in the chair in this lounge room where all six occupants of the house apparently had equally free access, and so far as the evidence goes in fact made equally free use, would not readily establish that there was exclusive physical control of these budda sticks in any one of the occupants unless there were some other evidence to accompany the finding of the budda sticks.” 
          (at 338) 
         
        
       
     7 It is true that the volume of evidence concerning the appellant’s premises; the use of those premises from time to time by the appellant; and the interaction of the appellant and, in particular, Vincent in connection with their respective access to and use of the premises, was not extensive. This Court, like the jury, must do, nevertheless, what it can to have a practical and sensible regard to the evidence as it stands, and to consider, in a level-headed sort of way, what the common course of experience suggests to be a reasonably inferred conclusion as to the joint possession of the weapons. Approached in that way, I am wholly unpersuaded that it was not open to the jury to take the view that the weapons were, at material times, in the joint possession, to say the least, of the appellant and of Vincent.  
      
       
     8 I agree, otherwise, with the reasoning of Dunford J.  
      
       
     9 In my opinion, the appellant’s conviction appeal has not been sustained, and I would dismiss it. 
      
       
     10 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Alan George Micallef against his conviction following trial by jury before Stewart ADCJ in the District Court at Sydney on charges of armed robbery with wounding and two counts of possession of a pistol without authorisation. He was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months for the armed robbery with wounding and concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 5 years for each of the firearm offences. 
      
       
     11 The Crown case was that the appellant was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Arnold Vincent to commit an armed robbery on Minett’s Pharmacy in Chester Hill, on 17 April 2001 and that in the course of that armed robbery one Nicholas Moustacas was wounded. The Crown relied on circumstantial evidence to prove its case. 
      
       
     12 The victim gave evidence that he was an accountant, and on 17 April 2001, he drove to Chester Hill to see a client, Gus Minett, the owner of Minett’s Pharmacy at 116 Waldron Street, Chester Hill. He arrived in the Chester Hill area at about 10.45am, and whilst he was driving on Waldron Road, he telephoned Joan Shields, who worked in the head office above the pharmacy, and asked her to activate the roller door in Frost Lane so that he could drive in and park in the pharmacy’s car park. 
      
       
     13 When Mr Moustacas got out of his car, he looked towards the back of the car and saw two men running towards him. They were both carrying guns. He described the first man as of a fairly lean/thin build, about 180 to 185cm tall, wearing long pants, a long sleeved sloppy-joe and a cap, all of a dark colour. He was wearing a hood over his beanie/balaclava and a cap over the top of that. The cap had an emblem on it – possibly a Nike emblem. The balaclava had the eyes and mouth cut out. This first man was holding a black hand-gun, about 10 to 15cm long, in his right hand. The barrel was about 10cm long. Mr Moustacas stated that he could see that the man had a “dark orangey brown” coloured goatee or facial hair underneath the balaclava, and green eyes. 
      
       
     14 He described the second man, whom the Crown alleged was the appellant, as of slightly stockier build than the first and slightly shorter than the first. He too was carrying a gun which was similar (if not identical) to the first man’s gun, and he was wearing a black balaclava or beanie covering his face with the eyes cut out (Mr Moustacas was unsure of whether the mouth had also been cut out). The second man was also wearing long pants and a sloppy-joe. Both men were wearing milky coloured latex gloves on their hands.  
      
       
     15 The first man grabbed Mr Moustacas’ keys and phone and gave them to the second man. He then pushed Mr Moustacas onto the front driver’s seat, so that his head was pushed over the counter console and a gun was held to the back of his head. The second man removed a brief case and a backpack from the back seat and rummaged through some personal items on the front passenger seat whilst the first man pushed Mr Moustacas onto the back seat so that his head was between the two front seats. 
      
       
     16 Mr Moustacas heard someone close the office door. The second man told the first man to hurry up and picked up the two bags and went across the adjoining tin roof, dropped the bags over the edge and jumped down after them. The first man led Mr Moustacas to a brick wall and told him to lie on the ground between his and another car. Mr Moustacas tried to grab the gun and push it away, then stepped forward and told him to “just piss off”, whereupon the first man aimed the gun at Mr Moustacas’ right leg and fired the gun, he then left in the direction of the tin roof. 
      
       
     17 Joan Shields assisted Mr Moustacas until the police and ambulance came and whilst she was doing so Mr Moustacas saw the Nike cap which the first man had been wearing lying on the ground. 
      
       
     18 Ms Shields described the man who was holding the briefcase (allegedly the appellant) as being of slight build and about five foot six or seven inches tall (about 165 to 168cm). He was wearing a black balaclava with only the eyes cut out and a long sleeved shirt. Ms Shields stated that the other man was pointing a gun towards Mr Moustacas and he was wearing a grey sloppy-joe with a hood covering his head. This man was of a very thin/small build. She believed that his hands were covered. The man who shot Mr Moustacas was a couple of centimetres taller than the other man. 
      
       
     19 Mr Moustacas was taken to Liverpool Hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet from his leg. As a result of the bullet wound, Mr Moustacas suffered an undisplaced fracture to the fibula as well as muscle and tissue damage. 
      
       
     20 At about ten past eight on 17 April 2001, Joe Panella was putting his bins out onto the footpath outside his Automotive Spare Parts business when he noticed a white van drive past his shop. He saw a male person in the vehicle who appeared to be of Middle Eastern appearance. The van drove past his shop on two further occasions and Mr Panella wrote down the registration number of the vehicle, XGW-886. 
      
       
     21 Ghabi El-Haddad owned Whistlers Laundrette at 112 Waldron Street, Chester Hill. At about 11am on 17 April 2001, he was returning to the laundrette when he saw a white van with NSW number plates parked in the lane off Frost Lane. He walked towards his shop when he heard what sounded like someone running on the roof of his shop. He then heard a ‘bang’ and saw two bags dropped onto the roof – a black briefcase and a backpack.  
      
       
     22 A man then jumped down onto the bags and pointed a gun at Mr Haddad. The man was approximately 40 to 45 years of age, 170-175cm tall, of medium build and had a very thick moustache which was a lighter colour than black. He was wearing a black beanie on his head. Mr Haddad stated that the man’s skin was darker than his, but not black. The Crown alleged that this man was the appellant. Mr Haddad saw this man run to the white van and then saw the van move.  
      
       
     23 A short while later, he heard a second man run across the roof of his shop and then saw him lower himself to the ground. This man was also carrying a gun and ran towards the white van. The second man was wearing a beanie, was of medium build and about 170-175cm tall. He also had a thick moustache. Mr Haddad noticed that this man was bleeding from his right hand. 
      
       
     24 Police attended at the scene and located the dark coloured Nike brand cap and a finger from a latex glove in the vicinity. Police also located a .22 calibre spent casing on the ground, and saw blood on a number of surfaces in the car park. Constable Howe gave evidence of locating a white Econovan some two kilometres away from the scene. The van did not have number plates. Enquiries revealed that the van had been stolen on 5 February 2001, from Andre Baron. 
      
       
     25 Constable Anastasiou collected a number of blood samples including from the gutter above Mr El-Haddad’s shop, from the laneway at the rear of the pharmacy and from the white van. A finger from a latex glove was also found on the floor of the van. These samples, together with the cap, were submitted to the Division of Analytical Laboratories for analysis. 
      
       
     26 At ten past eleven on 27 April 2001, police attended at 113 Oliphant Street, Mount Pritchard, and spoke to an occupier, Danielle Bonello. In the driveway they saw a white van with no registration plates. A short time later, Senior Constable Casser saw the appellant and Arnold Vincent walk out the front door of the house and walk east along Oliphant Street where they were stopped by police. 
      
       
     27 Later in the day a search warrant was executed at 113 Oliphant Street and a number of items were located in the premises, including from in the roof cavity of the house, one .25 millimetre Chinese manufactured self-loading pistol and six rounds of ammunition, and one black .22 long rifle calibre Margolan self-loading pistol with a magazine and one super .22 bullet. Various documents in the name of Andre Baron (the owner of the Econovan) and an owner’s manual which had been in the van when stolen were also located in the house. Also found in the house were documents in the name of the appellant, although there was no evidence that any documents in the name of Vincent were located. They also found registration plates AHZ-01H and a registration label for vehicle LPM-964.  
      
       
     28 There was evidence that three people lived in the house, the appellant, Vincent and Danielle Bonello. It was conceded on the hearing of the appeal that the premises were leased by the appellant and he had no other address, whilst Vincent and Ms Bonello stayed there on occasions and Vincent had another address in Glebe. 
      
       
     29 The appellant was subsequently arrested by police and declined to be interviewed. Arnold Vincent was arrested on 2 May 2001 and scientific evidence showed that Arnold Vincent had the same DNA profile in the Profiler Plus System as the DNA recovered from the gutter above Mr El-Haddad’s shop, from inside the white Econovan, and from blood on a pillar in the car park, and that such DNA profile occurs in fewer than one in ten billion people in the general population.  
      
       
     30 On analysis of the cap, it was found that the appellant had the same DNA profile in the Profiler Plus System as the major component of the DNA mixture found in the cap. That DNA profile occurs in fewer than one in ten billion people in the general population. Arnold Vincent was not a contributor to the minor component of the DNA mixture. According to the analyst, Michelle Franco, the DNA evidence could not establish who had last worn the cap or when the appellant had last worn it, but she also said it was unlikely to find a person’s DNA on the cap if that person had only worn it over a beanie, as Vincent had done. Vincent subsequently pleaded guilty to the armed robbery. 
      
       
     31 Detective Sergeant Karras described Vincent as being 172cm tall with dark brown hair tied in a plait at the back of his neck, and of thin build. He described the appellant as being of thin to medium build – slightly more solid than Vincent – and a little taller than him, about 175-176cm tall. Both men were aged about 43. 
      
       
     32 Raphael Jackson was a scientific officer attached to the Forensic Ballistics Section. He gave evidence that the bullet removed from Mr Moustacas’ leg and the spent cartridge found at the scene were consistent with having been fired from the Margolan self-loading pistol located during the execution of the search warrant at 113 Oliphant Street. 
      
       
     33 The appellant did not give evidence and called no witnesses but on his behalf it was submitted that the circumstantial evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was the other robber. 
      
       
     34 The grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant were: 
      
       
       1. That, having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported, and 
        
       2. That the trial judge erred in failing to adequately or properly direct the jury as to the law in respect of possession. 
        
       
     35 The case against the appellant in respect to each charge on the indictment was a circumstantial one. Briefly:· Two loaded automatic pistols were found in the roof cavity of the appellant’s house on 27 April 2001.· One of those pistols had been fired during the armed robbery at Chester Hill on 17 April 2001 so wounding the victim of that robbery.· Descriptions of the two pistols given by the victim of the robbery matched the two pistols found in the roof of the appellant’s home.· Blood was found at the scene and was found in a stolen Ford Econovan vehicle used by the robbers and abandoned a short distance away from the robbery.· The DNA profile of the blood matched the profile of the man called Arnold Vincent. Vincent, when arrested, had a healing cut to one of his fingers. Vincent was the robber who had fired the shot wounding the victim.· Papers in the name of the appellant were found in the house, but apparently no papers belonging to Vincent.· The vehicle had been stolen three months earlier and papers belonging to the owner of the stolen motor vehicle were found in a brown paper bag on the kitchen table in the appellant’s home.· Another Ford Econovan vehicle, similar to the stolen vehicle, was seen by police in the rear yard of the appellant’s home.· Registration plates and a registration label in respect of vehicles other than the vehicle parked in the appellant’s driveway were found in the appellant’s house.· Vincent and the appellant were seen leaving the appellant’s home together on 27 April 2001 and Vincent, an acquaintance of the appellant, had stayed from time to time at the appellant’s home.· A Nike brand cap, worn by Vincent over a balaclava at the time of the robbery and discarded at the scene was found to have DNA that matched the appellant’s profile. · Descriptions of the two robbers, including the driver of the vehicle observed circling the area by Mr Panello, given by the victim and eye-witnesses, were consistent, as far as they went, with Vincent and the appellant, and were consistent with their heights as described by Det Sgt Karras based on their appearances at time of arrest.· Vincent’s DNA was found on the ground where the robbery took place and in the getaway vehicle and Vincent had pleaded guilty.· The evidence also showed a considerable degree of planning and preparation in that the robbery took place on the Tuesday after a Public Holiday, a day on which it was the practice of the proprietor of the pharmacy to be arriving at the premises with a large quantity of money about the time of the robbery. 
      
       
     36 Notwithstanding proof by the Crown of all these facts, none of which was really in dispute, except, to a degree, the descriptions given of the robbers, the appellant did not give evidence, but this fact cannot be taken into account as evidence against him, it does not constitute an admission by him, it may not be used to fill gaps in the prosecution case and it may not be used as a make-weight: Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25, 205 CLR 50 at [34], nor can this Court take it into account: Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45, 192 ALR 181 at [60] and [125], overruling R v Gordon (1991) 57 A Crim R 413 at 418. 
      
       
     37 But putting these considerations aside, the Crown still presented in my view, a strong circumstantial case. 
      
       
     38 Vincent and the appellant were associates in that not only were they seen together leaving the appellant’s house on 27 April, but Vincent from time to time stayed at that house although he had another address elsewhere. In the appellant’s house two guns were found, one of which was the gun used by Vincent in the robbery when both robbers had a gun. Although the getaway van (proved to be such by Vincent’s DNA) was found shortly after the robbery in Sefton, papers belonging to Mr Baron, its owner, were located on the kitchen table in the appellant’s house. Moreover, the Nike cap worn by Vincent over his balaclava contained none of his DNA, but did contain that of the appellant, very strongly suggesting that it was the appellant’s cap; and the descriptions given by the various witnesses matched not only Vincent, but also the appellant, and the jury had the opportunity of observing the appellant in the dock during the trial, as has this Court during the hearing of the appeal, and could see how the descriptions fitted the appellant, not only as to his height and build, but also as to his “Middle Eastern appearance” (Mr Panello) and his skin being darker but not black (Mr El-Haddad). 
      
       
     39 In Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243, Dixon CJ repeated what he had said in Martin v Osborne (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person, the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that,  
         according to the common course of human affairs 
         , the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.” 
          (my underlining) 
         
        
       
     40 After referring to the type of matters which cannot be taken into account, such as character, reputations, associations etc, his Honour went on: 
      
       
        
         
         “But the class of acts and occurrences which may be considered includes circumstances whose relation to the facts in issue consists in the probability or increased probability,  
         judged rationally upon common experience 
         , that they would not be found unless the fact to be proved also existed.” 
          (my underlining) 
         
        
       See also  
       Knight v The Queen  
       (1992) 175 CLR 495. 
        
       
     41 It is also important to bear in mind that in considering a circumstantial evidence case, it is not the individual circumstances that need to be considered, but the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together; and the jury can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference: Chamberlain v The Queen [2] (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536. 
      
       
     42 There is often a tendency in cases of this nature to consider whether each individual circumstance can be separately explained away as being consistent with innocence; or to consider whether a path, however tortuous, can be found through a combination of the circumstances, which as a matter of strict logic, is capable of being reconciled with a conclusion of innocence. The correct test, however, as explained by Dixon CJ in the passages quoted above, is whether, judging the matter rationally in the light of the common experience of human affairs, the combination and totality of the facts proved are consistent with innocence. 
      
       
     43 The question for this Court is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; and in answering that question it must not disregard or discount the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence; but if this Court concludes that, even making full allowances for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted, the Court is bound to act and set aside the verdict: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-4.  
      
       
     44 Notwithstanding the submissions on behalf of the appellant, I am satisfied that in the present case it was open to the jury to be satisfied that in the ordinary course of human experience and affairs, the combination and totality of the circumstances proved by the Crown were not consistent with the innocence of the appellant; and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the second person involved in the armed robbery. It was essentially a question for the jury representing, as it does, the common experience of the community, and I can see no significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted. The first ground of appeal accordingly fails. 
      
       
     45 The other ground of appeal relied on is in relation to the directions given by his Honour as to the meaning of “possession” in the context of the second and third counts in the indictment. 
      
       
     46 During the application by defence counsel for a verdict by direction on the first count, he also submitted that the Crown had not demonstrated “any Filippetti type possession, exclusive control” in relation to the guns, and that the guns, secreted as they were in the roof, could have been in the possession of any of the persons in the house. The reference to “Filippetti type possession” was a reference to R v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335, to which I shall return. 
      
       
     47 In his Summing-Up, his Honour dealt with this issue as follows (SU 37 ff) 
      
       
        
         
         “What does possession mean at law? A dictionary would probably tell you to possess something means to have the thing. I need to clarify that concept of possession as it is recognised by the law in the present context. The essence of a concept of possession in the law is that at the relevant time you intentionally have control over the object in question … People may have control over the object in question alone. The person can have the control solely, exclusively and alone. Or two or more can have it jointly. A person may have sole control or joint control with some other person or persons, that is you and those persons if any, must have the right to exclude other people from it. If those conditions are fulfilled then you may be said to have possession of the object, whether it is in your own sole possession or whether it is a joint possession with somebody else … You can possess something jointly with one or more other persons.” 
         
        
       Later he continued (SU 39 ff): 
        
         
         “In defining possession earlier I used the phrase intentionally have control. This is to make clear that if something has been for example slipped into your suitcase or shoved into the ceiling cavity and you do not know about it, it is unknown to you that that has happened, then you are not regarded as having possession of it in law, even though it may be there. The Crown puts to you in this case that these two pistols were in the accused possession  
         (sic) 
          jointly, and as I understand the case jointly with Vincent.” 
         
        
       
     48 At the conclusion of the Summing-Up, defence counsel referred his Honour to R v Sobolewski (unreported – CCA – 17 June 1998) and R v Filippetti and sought further directions in relation to joint possession or possession in circumstances where other occupants of premises had not been excluded as being in possession of (in those cases) the drugs, and submitted that Ms Benello or Vincent had not been excluded as being in possession of the guns. 
      
       
     49 Both Sobolewski and Filippetti were cases in which the Crown alleged possession by an individual, but failed to exclude the reasonable possibility of the drugs being in the exclusive possession of another person who had access to the premises where the drugs were found, or to prove that such other person was acting in concert with the appellant. Here the Crown alleged either possession by the appellant, or joint possession by the appellant and Vincent, and when considering counsel’s application his Honour expressed concern (SU 59) that to focus on the possibility of Ms Benello having possession (to the exclusion of the appellant) would merely underline the fact that the appellant had control, and would thus be detrimental to the appellant. 
      
       
     50 On the evidence before the jury, possession of the guns by Ms Benello, to the exclusion of the appellant, was simply not an issue. The guns were found secreted in the appellant’s house, one of them had been used to shoot the victim, the second man at the robbery had been carrying a similar gun, and once the jury was satisfied in relation to the first count that the appellant was the other man at the robbery, it followed that the guns were either in the possession of the appellant or of the appellant and Vincent jointly. 
      
       
     51 Accordingly, I am satisfied there was no material misdirection in the Summing-Up in relation to the meaning of possession and the third ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     52 I therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed and the convictions affirmed. 
      
       
     53 BELL J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft form the judgment of Dunford J. I respectfully adopt both his Honour’s statement of the facts and the principles which govern this Court in its determination of an appeal against conviction, upon the ground that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable. However, I have come to a different view concerning the way that this appeal should be determined.  
      
       
     54 In written submissions the Crown contended that it had been open to the jury to be satisfied as to each of the circumstances that are set out in Dunford J’s judgment at [35]. Upon acceptance of those matters the Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to have found that the following intermediate facts were established: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) the appellant was connected with the stolen car used in the robbery; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Vincent was one of the robbers; 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) the appellant was in possession, either alone or jointly, of the firearms; 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) the appellant was closely associated with Vincent. 
         
        
       
     55 In the Crown’s submission these four facts when taken in conjunction with the evidence of the descriptions of the two offenders permitted the jury to infer that the appellant was the second robber and that any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence had been eliminated. 
      
       
     56 For reasons that I will explain I do not consider that the evidence was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the third intermediate fact; that the appellant was in possession of the firearms. The remaining three intermediate facts set out in (i), (ii) and (iv) above to my mind do not serve individually or in combination to place the appellant at the scene of the robbery (nor would satisfaction that he was in possession of the firearms on 27 April 2001). The quality of the description of the second robber given by the eye witnesses does not overcome this deficiency in the Crown case.  
      
       
     57 It may be accepted that the appellant was an associate of Arnold Vincent (“Vincent”) and that Vincent was the robber who fired the shot that wounded Nicholas Moustacas and that at the time he was wearing the Nike cap over a beanie/balaclava. It may also be accepted that one of the guns located in the premises leased by the appellant at 113 Oliphant Street, Mount Pritchard (“the premises”) was the weapon used by Vincent in the course of the robbery.  
      
       
     58 Constable David Cutler gave evidence of the execution of the search warrant at the premises. The occupiers’ notice was served on Danielle Bonello (“Bonello”). Constable Cutler satisfied himself that she was an occupier of the premises. Both the appellant and Vincent were present at the premises earlier that day. 
      
       
     59 Constable Cutler said that the premises had three bedrooms. He believed that there might also have been a bed set up in the lounge room. Over objection he gave evidence that on the day of the search he believed that at least three persons had been sleeping in the premises. Constable Cutler initially described the room in which Vincent was staying as having the appearance of a junk room or a spare room. He was recalled and said that he had been mistaken in this respect and that the room that Vincent was using was a bedroom that had the indicia of being used as such.  
      
       
     60 Generally Constable Cutler said of the condition of the premises that they were, “fairly unkempt” (T27/05/02 at 203). 
      
       
     61 Vincent and Bonello were residing at the premises in April 2001 from time to time. The evidence was that they also had a residence in Glebe. The fact that Vincent and Bonello were staying at the premises seems to me to detract from the evidentiary significance of (i) the finding of the papers associated with the stolen Econovan used in the robbery, (ii) the Nike cap and (iii) the finding of the guns.  
      
       
     62 The owner of the Econovan was Andre Baron. A number of personal documents belonging to Mr Baron including bank statements, a cheque book, an Econovan Owner’s Manual and a business registration were in the vehicle on the day that it was stolen. Senior Constable Cassar located these papers during the course of the search of the premises. They were in a brown paper bag that resembled a sandwich bag. The bag was on a small table in the corner of the kitchen. There was no writing on the outside of the bag (T23/04/02 at 127). 
      
       
     63 Given that the appellant was not the sole occupant of the premises (and noting the description of the premises as “unkempt”) I have some difficulty seeing that one could safely draw the inference that the appellant was aware of the contents of the brown bag. However, accepting for present purposes that such an inference might be drawn, I do not consider that it materially serves to support the Crown case. So much seems to me to be acknowledged in the Crown’s written submissions extracted at [54] above, in the assertion that it was open to the jury to conclude, “that the appellant was connected with the stolen car used in the robbery”. The Econovan was stolen on 5 February 2001. The robbery occurred on 17 April 2001 and the appellant’s premises were searched and the documents seized on 27 April 2001. If it is open to conclude that the appellant had knowledge of the stolen car by reason of the presence of the papers connected with it in his home, I do not consider that one can take the further step and conclude that the appellant was in the van on 17 April 2001 when it was used by Vincent to commit the robbery.  
      
       
     64 The circumstance that Vincent was wearing a Nike cap, that had been worn by the appellant on an occasion prior to 17 April 2001, seems to me to lose evidentiary significance in the context that he and Vincent shared the same untidy house.  
      
       
     65 Senior Constables Kendall and Crematy gave evidence of finding the two firearms in the roof cavity of the premises. Access to the roof was apparently gained through a manhole. Senior Constable Crematy located a black Tokarev semi-automatic pistol lying on a pink insulation batt (T22/05/02 at 120) and Senior Constable Kendall located a Margolan brand .22 calibre semi-automatic pistol concealed by a pink insulation batt (T22/05/02 at 99). There was no evidence to connect the appellant to the firearms, save for the circumstance that he was the lessee of the premises. Given the unchallenged evidence that at least two other persons were also residing at the premises I do not consider that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the weapons either solely or jointly with Vincent; R v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335. This was essential to proof of the Crown case with respect to counts two and three. 
      
       
     66 Duty Officer Karras gave evidence of the physical appearance of Vincent and of the appellant. Vincent was approximately 172 cms in height with dark brown hair tied in a plait at the back. His build was skinny. The appellant’s build was skinny to medium. The appellant was a little bit taller and a little bit more solid than Vincent. Duty Officer Karras assessed him as being about 175, 176 cms in height. Both men were aged forty-three years (T23/05/02 at 139-140). 
      
       
     67 As is to be expected in a case where civilian witnesses are describing sudden and frightening events, the description of the two men given by Nicholas Moustacas, Joan Shields and Ghabi El-Haddad varied in a number of respects.  
      
       
     68 Nicholas Moustacas estimated the age of his assailants to be about twenty-five years. The first man was fairly lean and about 180, 185 cms tall (T16/05/02 at 14). The second man was of slightly stockier build (T16/05/02 at 16). The first man spoke with an Australian accent in a fairly husky voice. The second man’s voice was “fairly normal”. Nicholas Moustacas detected nothing unusual about the second man’s accent (T16/05/02 at 20). Nicholas Moustacas is 185 cms tall. The first man was slightly shorter than he. He thought both men were about the same height, but that the stockier man might have been slightly shorter (T16/05/02 at 28). The two men did not look to be teenagers, he thought they were in the twenty-five to thirty year age bracket, but he noted that it was very difficult to say without seeing their faces (T16/05/02 at 30). Nicholas Moustacas agreed that in a statement, made on 23 April 2001, he had described the second robber as being aged “twenty to twenty-five” and of the same height as the first man, but a bigger build (T16/05/02 at 31). 
      
       
     69 Joan Shields was an eyewitness to the robbery. She described the second robber as being about five foot six, five foot seven (T16/05/02 at 35). This man was of very slight build, not very heavy at all, very narrow in the hips (T16/05/02 at 36). She put the first robber as being “maybe a couple of cms taller than the second robber. He was very slight in build” (T16/05/02 at 39). She was not able to form an opinion as to the age of the two men. When she first saw them she thought that they were kids, but that opinion was based on the fact that both were so small in build (T16/05/02 at 39).  
      
       
     70 Ghabi El-Haddad saw the two robbers as they were making their getaway. The first person he saw was the second man. He described him as being probably about forty-five years of age, 170 – 175 cms tall with a very thick moustache. The moustache was not black, but lighter than black. He said of his skin colour that “I mean he’s not white, but he’s not dark. I mean I’ve got a white skin, but he’s darker than me, so” (T22/05/02 at 108). He said that he would describe this man as having “Caucasian features”.  
      
       
     71 It was a matter for the jury to consider the reliability of the descriptions variously given as to the two robbers. Ghabi El-Haddad’s description in terms of age and height is one consistent with the second man being the appellant. The jury might well have reasoned that Mr El-Haddad was better placed than victim of the incident or Joan Shields (who watched it unfold) to give a reliable description of the two men. Mr Byrne SC realistically accepted that it was open to the jury to find the evidence of the physical appearance of the second man was consistent with him being the appellant.  
      
       
     72 Joe Panella observed the white van driving in the vicinity of the Chester Hill Pharmacy at around 8:05 am on the morning of the robbery. He considered the circumstances to be suspicious and took a note of the registration of the vehicle. When asked if he could see inside the van he said “it was very obscure, I couldn’t see who was driving the vehicle” (T16/05/02 at 50). He was not sure whether his difficulty in seeing through the windows was because they were dirty or tinted. He had been able to see a male in the vehicle, “I couldn’t see exactly, but to me he looked like of Middle Eastern appearance” (T16/05/02 at 50). It was open to the jury to consider that Mr Panella’s description was consistent with the man he saw being the appellant.  
      
       
     73 This is a case in which it seems to me that very strong suspicion attaches to the appellant as being the second man involved in the commission of the robbery. 
      
       
     74 The test to be applied by this Court in determining whether the verdict is unreasonable is that set out in the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, namely whether the Court considers that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In determining this issue the Court must not disregard that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, nor that the jury had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. 75 The Crown case was a circumstantial one. Ultimately it was necessary for the Crown to exclude any rational inference other than that the appellant was the second man at the scene of the robbery. I consider that the Crown failed to eliminate the reasonable possibility that Vincent carried out the robbery in company with another man and that he, Vincent, concealed the weapons used in the robbery in the premises at which he was residing. 76 For the reasons that I have already given I consider that it was not open to the jury to conclude that the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession either solely or jointly of the firearms located in the ceiling of the premises of which he was the lessee.77 Given the view that I have come to concerning the first ground I have not found it necessary to deal with the ground that challenged the adequacy of the direction as to the element of possession.78 For these reasons I would propose that the appeal be allowed and that the convictions recorded in the District Court be quashed and that verdicts of acquittal be substituted in each case.

   DECISION : 
   It is appropriate for this court to intervene and to pass in lieu of the sentence passed by the learned trial judge a sentence of six and a half years to date from 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 April 2010 with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 October 2007. The sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of a two year fixed term should stand but commence upon 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2004. This would mean that there would be an overall sentence of some seven and a half years imprisonment with a five year non-parole period. The sentence would commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2010, the non-parole period to commence the same date but would expire on 14 October 2007. The earliest date upon which the applicant might be eligible for parole would be 14 October 2007.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
    1 GREG JAMES J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Nield QC in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta following a trial at which the offender pleaded not guilty to two charges, the first being a charge of robbery in company, the second being a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    2 Following the verdict of the jury which was a verdict of guilty on each charge, his Honour sentenced the offender for the offence of robbery in company, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, to a term of imprisonment of eight years commencing 15 October 2003 and expiring 14 October 2011. In respect of that sentence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of five years expiring on 14 October 2008.  
     
      
    3 For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, his Honour sentenced the offender to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2004. It can therefore be seen that one year of the sentences overlapped. The effective total sentence thus passed by his Honour was one of imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had been at the time of the commission of the instant offences on parole. He had on 15 November 2001 failed to appear at Burwood Local Court in relation to a matter for which he was on bail to that court to that date. The Parole Board ordered the revocation of the applicant’s parole and directed that the parole order be treated as having been revoked on 4 August 2001. He was arrested on 6 December 2001 and when arrested was charged with the matters the subject of this appeal. He has been in continuous custody since.  
     
      
    5 In a careful and closely reasoned judgment his Honour the trial judge reviewed the circumstances of the offence and all the matters to which he was required, particularly by s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, to have regard. His Honour referred to the circumstances of the commission of the offence in the following way:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the robbery of and assault upon the victim this, stated briefly, is what happened. Shortly after he had left a train at Lidcombe railway station, Mr. Wong was accosted by two males of Asian appearance, one of whom was the offender. The offender’s co-offender told Mr. Wong that he had a knife and that he, Mr. Wong, must go with them. The offender’s co-offender took Mr. Wong’s wallet and mobile telephone and demanded that Mr. Wong tell him his personal identification number for his telephone. Being fearful of what might happen to him, Mr. Wong told them the personal identification number for his telephone. As they walked along, they came upon some people walking towards them. After they had passed these people, Mr. Wong ran off in the hope of escaping from the offender and his co-offender. However, he was chased and caught and attacked by the offender and his co-offender. The assault took place in the driveway of 3 Railway Parade at the corner with Clarence Street at Lidcombe just as Ms. Donna Natale was driving her car into the driveway. Notwithstanding Mrs. Natale’s presence, the offender and his co-offender continued their assault upon Mr. Wong and, as they did so, the offender put his hand on the driver’s side of the bonnet of Mrs. Natale’s car, leaving a fingerprint on it. His fingerprint linked him positively to the robbery of and assault upon Mr. Wong. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Wong lost his wallet containing his identification papers, $40 Australian, $1,000 Hong Kong and his mobile telephone.” 
        
       
      
    6 It is apparent that not only were there two charges but there were two critical events in this period of criminality separated by Mr. Wong’s attempt to escape and the chase by the offenders of him after the robbery and prior to their assault upon him. As his Honour’s remarks make clear in a later passage, Mr. Wong suffered some considerable injury during the punching and kicking by the offender and the co-offender of him in the assault. Other material not referred to by his Honour in the judgment makes it clear that Mr. Wong woke up from a period of unconsciousness in hospital with his face covered with blood, although he did not sustain any facial fractures.  
     
      
    7 The learned trial judge enumerated matters that he took into consideration. It is not necessary to review these in detail as no challenge has been made to his Honour having taken into account the particular matters nor is it suggested that he failed to take into account any particular matter.  
     
      
    8 It is, however, submitted that his Honour fell into error in three ways. Firstly, that the sentence, and in particular the sentence for the offence of robbery in company, was manifestly excessive; secondly, that his Honour erred in failing to have sufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances; thirdly, that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in accumulating the sentences for the year that he did and in accumulating these sentences upon the head sentence the applicant had been serving on parole at the time which the offence was committed.  
     
      
    9 It is convenient to turn initially to the second ground. The learned trial Judge set out the relevant subjective circumstances to which counsel has taken us in his remarks on sentence. He noted that the offender was 27 years and five months at the time of the commission of the offence. He had been born in South Vietnam and was the eighth of his parents nine children. His father died during 1990. His mother died on 24 January 2002. Other material in the trial papers indicates that the offender was disturbed at being unable to visit his mother in Vietnam prior to her death. The offender was raised in a rural setting and escaped from Vietnam in 1987 when aged 13 years. He lived in a refugee camp in Malaysia for some nine months and emigrated from there into Australia with his brother and sister toward the end of 1987.  
     
      
    10 He had been educated at Chester Hill High School, Canterbury High School and then Marrickville High School having lived in Sydney with an uncle but was expelled from each High School for disobedience. He had a limited education not completing Year 10. He had held one job for a period of time as a press operator and had apparently enjoyed good health. 
     
      
    11 His Honour specifically rejected that matters referred to in a psychologist’s report were of useful bearing from the point of view of sentence upon the circumstances of the offender’s commission of the subject offence. 
     
      
    12 He is a single person with no dependents who had when young commenced the use of alcohol and drugs. He had attempted apparently to cease the consumption of alcohol and drugs but had been found twice with a prohibited drug in his urine sample whilst in gaol.  
     
      
    13 As against these, the trial Judge referred to the applicant’s prior criminal record. He had been dealt with for some 22 offences, nine in the Children’s Court, four in the Local Court and nine in the District Court. The offences included an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding, an offence of malicious wounding, two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four offences of assault, one offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, offences of kidnapping, breaking, entering and stealing and using a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear beyond doubt that the offender has learned nothing whatsoever from his previous convictions and the penalties imposed upon him therefore.” 
        
       
      
    14 The subjective circumstances to which his Honour referred were the subject of a submission that the applicant’s history of dislocation as a refugee from Vietnam, the loss of his parents, his drug addictions and the expression of regret by him in his evidence for having committed this offence were such as to show that the sentence exceeded that which was appropriate for that reason alone. I do not accept that submission, particularly when one has regard to the applicant’s prior offences and the commission of this offence whilst on parole.  
     
      
    15 It is convenient then to turn to the question of cumulation. It was submitted that his Honour had erred in passing, as he was required to do, consonant with Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, separate sentences for the offences of robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and then cumulating, to the extent that he did, those sentences since it was submitted that the offences were so close in time, involved the same victim and the same offenders as to constitute a single continuing episode. Even should that be accepted, though as I have already referred to the two events were separated by the victim’s attempt to flee, nonetheless it does not seem to me that it was not open to his Honour acting in accordance with a sound discretion to have passed sentence in a way which involved a degree of cumulation and I do not see that complaint might properly be made about an effective additional component of one year of full-time custody to reflect the additional offence. In my view, that ground also should be dismissed.  
     
      
    16 That takes me then to the last submission made which was in support of ground one in the notice of appeal. The trial judge concluded that having regard to what he had said concerning the offences and the offender and balancing those features:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have determined that the sentence for the robbery in company offence must be imprisonment for eight years and the sentence for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence must be imprisonment for three years.”  
        
       
      
    17 His Honour then had regard to the principle of totality and determined that the overall sentence must be imprisonment for nine years. His Honour reached the conclusion that this sentence must be passed particularly in the light of what his Honour said concerning his expectation that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As history has the habit of repeating itself his history of criminal offending will repeat itself after his release from prison.” 
        
       
      
    18 In his view there had to be passed a sentence with a substantial and condign deterrent aspect. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of the offender’s criminal record, including, as it does, twice having breached his parole, he must be reminded yet again and loudly and clearly that repeat offending will not be condoned nor tolerated. The sentences imposed upon him must stand as a warning to others who may think of doing what he has done.”  
        
       
      
    19 His Honour doubted the offender’s protestations of contrition and doubted any motivation towards any rehabilitation. His Honour treated the breach of parole as an aggravating feature of the offences and having regard to s.21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour was plainly right to do so. Even though his Honour’s direction that the sentences should commence at the expiration of the parole period, parole having been revoked, and his Honour having treated the breach of parole as an aggravation and the Parole Board having revoked the parole, means that in three different ways the appellant must pay for his breaching parole by the commission of this offence, it does not seem to me that that is not what the law provides for. Indeed it is a consequence of having enjoyed conditional liberty upon an undertaking to be of good behaviour that, if you breach that undertaking, you aggravate your culpability for offence you commit which constitutes the breach, you surrender the prospect of liberty which you have enjoyed conditionally upon your not committing a breach and you must expect to serve in custody the sentence from the custodial nature of which you had been liberated conditionally.  
     
      
    20 That being said when I turned to the actual facts of the offender’s involvement in the offence of robbery it can be seen that it did not include his performing the role of threatening the victim explicitly and it did not include his involvement in any direct application of corporal violence, even to the extent of his personally taking the victim’s property. He did punch and kick the victim and in this regard I see no possible error in the sentence of a fixed term of two years for the assault. However, I have come to the conclusion, notwithstanding the able submissions put by the learned Crown Prosecutor, that the sentence of eight years for the robbery in company offence was well in excess of that governed by the exercise of a sound discretion having regard to the offender’s role and the objective circumstances of that offence, notwithstanding the applicant’s prior record and that the offence had been committed on parole.  
     
      
    21 I would, therefore, consider that it is appropriate for this court to intervene and to pass in lieu of the sentence passed by the learned trial judge a sentence of six and a half years to date from 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 April 2010 with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 October 2007. The sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of a two year fixed term should stand but commence upon 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2004. This would mean that there would be an overall sentence of some seven and a half years imprisonment with a five year non-parole period. The sentence would commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2010, the non-parole period to commence the same date but would expire on 14 October 2007. The earliest date upon which the applicant might be eligible for parole would be 14 October 2007.  
     
      
    22 Such a sentence of course means that I accept, as the trial judge did, that there are special circumstances arising from the accumulation and from the dating of the sentence commencement date such as warrant a non-parole period of the length to which I have referred. 
     
      
    23 DUNFORD, J: I agree. The orders will be as indicated by Greg James J.

  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  1                     The applicants (‘Natural Waters’) distribute bottled water in Australia under the brand name “FIJI” (‘Fiji Water’).  The respondents (together ‘Dayals’) distribute in Australia water bottled in Fiji under the brand name “Island Chill”.  Mr Jay Dayal (‘Mr Dayal’) is a director of the first respondent (‘Artesian Waters’) and is actively engaged in its day to day management and control.  Mr Dayal’s father and mother are also directors of Artesian Waters.  The family operates a hardwood export business and it was Mr Dayal’s idea in 2001 that they enter the bottled water market.  He was responsible for the marketing “get-up” of the Island Chill product, including bottle shape and label design.  Mr Pranesh Dayal is Mr Dayal’s younger brother and trading partner in Australia.  He reports to Mr Dayal daily in relation to Dayals’ business activities in Australia.

  2                     Natural Waters alleges, in broad terms, contraventions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (‘the Act’), ss 42 and 44 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and passing off by Dayals because of the packaging of Island Chill.  These causes of action are each founded on the assertion that Island Chill’s packaging shares a sufficient number of the features of Fiji Water’s packaging so as to give rise to a representation that there is at least an association between the products and between Natural Waters and Dayals, where there is none.  Natural Waters and Artesian Waters both own registered trade marks in Australia but no allegation of trade mark infringement is pleaded. 

  3                     The issues that arise are:

  ·                    The nature of the goods and their get-up.

  ·                    The reputation of Fiji Water.

  ·                    The intention of Dayals in designing the bottle and label for Island Chill.

  ·                    Whether the consumer would be misled or deceived into thinking that Island Chill was Fiji Water or associated with Fiji Water or Natural Waters. 

  The nature of the goods and their get-up

  4                     Natural Waters describes bottled water in its written submissions as a “fast moving consumer good”.  This expression encompasses ‘an inexpensive, every day product sold in almost every food and beverage retail outlet throughout Australia’.

  5                     There are approximately 100 brands of bottled water products available for sale in Australia but apart from Fiji Water, Island Chill and, for a short period of time, one other product, no other bottled water is sourced from Fiji or otherwise uses the Fiji Islands as part of its title, marketing strategy or brand.  The retail price of Fiji Water varies.  While it is generally more expensive than the Dayals product, there are locations where Fiji Water is sold within the price range of Island Chill.

  Fiji Water

  6                     Fiji Water is the first bottled water product to originate from Fiji.  From about mid 2003 to mid 2006, Fiji Water was bottled and distributed in Australia by Natural Waters in a get-up (‘the 2003 get-up’)which included the name “Fiji Natural Spring Water”. 

   

  The 2003 get-up

  

  7                     Since October 2005, Natural Waters has bottled and distributed Fiji Water in Australia in a get-up (‘the 2005 get-up’) which includes the name “Fiji Natural Artesian Water”. 

  The 2005 get-up

  

   

  8                     For a period from October 2005 Fiji Water was available in both get-ups.  From April 2006 only the 2005 get-up has been used.

  Similarities and differences in the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up

  9                     The parties agree that the 2003 get-up contains the following features:

  (a)                use of a clear bottle with a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  (b)               use of a blue cap;

  (c)                use of a colourful, tropical motif featuring tropical plants and other vegetation;

  (d)               the depiction of a body of water in a tropical setting on the lower portion of the inner side of the back label;

  (e)                a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label;

  (f)                 prominent use of the word “Fiji”; and

  (g)                use of the words “Taste of Paradise”.

  10                  The parties agree that the 2005 get-up contains the following features:

  (a)                use of a clear bottle with a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  (b)               use of a blue cap;

  (c)                use of a colourful, tropical motif featuring tropical plants and other vegetation;

  (d)               the depiction of a blue background and fern leaves on the inner side of the back label;

  (e)                a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label; and

  (f)                 prominent use of the word “Fiji”.

  11                  Natural Waters emphasises what it says are the common features of the two get-ups:

  (a)                use of a clear bottle with a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  (b)               use of a blue cap;

  (c)                use of a colourful, tropical motif featuring tropical plants and other vegetation;

  (d)               a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label; and

  (e)                prominent use of the word “Fiji”.

  12                  The differences between the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up that are immediately apparent to the eye are:

  (a)                The use of a different motif of tropical flowers.  The 2003 get-up contains a range of flowers, including a white orchid, almost centrally placed at the bottom of the transparent label and a red hibiscus, above and to the left of the orchid, facing towards the centre.  The 2005 get-up has, as a single tropical flower, a pink hibiscus located at the bottom right of the transparent label, facing upwards and towards the centre. 

  (b)               The inner side of the back label of the 2003 get-up depicts a body of water, including a waterfall in a predominantly blue and white colour scheme.  The 2005 get-up has, on the inner side of the back label, striations of blue, green and white with green fern leaves; the predominant effect is of green and blue.

  13                  There are other differences, such as the words “bottled at source” at the bottom of the transparent label in the 2003 get-up and “from the islands of” above “FIJI” in the 2005 get-up.  These differences are apparent on closer inspection, rather than by immediate impression.

  14                  The labels on the back side of the bottles appear different and the style and content of the writing is also different.  In particular, on bottles with the 2003 get-up, there is a map of the Pacific region in pale blue and white.  Four alternate graphics are used on bottles with the 2005 get-up. The content of the writing varies depending on the graphic.  While the colours used also vary, the back label in the 2005 get-up is predominantly blue and white.

  Island Chill

  15                  Dayals commenced importing, distributing and selling Island Chill bottled water in Australia in December 2005 with the following get-up:

  Island Chill

  

   

  16                  The parties agree that the get-up of Island Chill (‘the Island Chill get-up’) includes the following features:

  (a)                the word “Fiji” in a prominent position on the front label as part of the expression “Bottled at Source in Fiji Islands”;

  (b)               a bottle which has a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  (c)                use of a blue cap;

  (d)               displays a body of water, or green image, on the inner side of the back label;

  (e)                displays a beach landscape in the background;

  (f)                 displays a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label; and

  (g)                use of the words “Taste of Perfection”.

  17                  Natural Waters does not assert an exclusive right to three-dimensional images on bottles, or to rectangular bottles, or to tropical scenes.  It asserts that a sufficient number of “the constellation of features associated with the get-up” of Fiji Water have been appropriated by Dayals for the get-up of Island Chill so as to create an impression of association between the products which is misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive.

  18                  The distinctive features of the Island Chill get-up that are immediately apparent as different from those of Fiji Water are:

  (a)                The brand name.  The words “Island Chill” bear no literary or textual resemblance to the word “FIJI”.  That “Island Chill” is represented to be the brand name of Dayals’ product is obvious; “Island Chill” is in substantially larger font than all other text on the bottle, located in a prominent (elevated and central) position and accompanied by a symbol of registration as a trade mark.  It is similarly obvious that on Natural Waters’ product, “FIJI” is represented to be the brand name of Fiji Water. 

  (b)               The visual appearance of the brand name.  “Island Chill” is in dark blue writing outlined by white and in lower case script.  “FIJI” on the bottle of Fiji Water is in capital script and in white writing outlined by gold.  The type fonts used are different.

  (c)                The shape of the bottles.  Island Chill, while square in its horizontal shape, is elongated and rectangular vertically.  The Fiji Water bottle is square in shape horizontally and vertically.  This results in the Island Chill bottle being noticeably taller and thinner than the Fiji Water bottle.

  (d)               The manner of use of “Fiji”.  Prominent on the Island Chill transparent label are the words, in blue writing outlined by white, “Bottled at Source in Fiji Islands”.  The effect of those words is to describe the geographical, rather than commercial, source of the product ([70] below).  As I have noted, “FIJI” is represented in the 2003 and 2005 get-ups as the brand name of Fiji Water.

  (e)                The tropical flower.  In the Island Chill get-up, the flower is a hibiscus of orange-pink hue, on the bottom right of the Island Chill transparent label facing outwards.  This is totally different from the motif of flowers and vegetation of Natural Waters’ 2003 get-up, which is dominated by a white orchid.  The tropical flower in the 2005 get-up is a hibiscus, but it is more pink in colour and faces a different direction.  It is also presented from a more horizontal perspective than the Island Chill flower.

  19                  There are further differences apparent when the bottles are compared side by side as they might be, for example, on a supermarket shelf.  I refer to them as they relate to features of Fiji Water relied upon by Natural Waters as distinctive of its product:

  1.                  The colour of the Island Chill lid is a darker shade of blue.

  2.                  The inner side of the Island Chill back label depicts a scene that is predominantly blue and white.  By comparison with the 2003 get-up, which is also predominantly blue and white, the obvious differences are the use of different subject matter: a waterfall (2003 get-up) versus beach and ocean (Island Chill) and the greater impact of green in the 2003 get-up, whereas the Island Chill inner back label gives the impression of being almost devoid of green.  The inner back label of the 2005 get-up depicts fern fronds and is predominantly green and blue. 

  20                  There are other differences which require more detailed analysis and to which there is no need presently to refer.  Some of the differences are on the labels on the back of the bottles where they would not be seen by a casual observer in a supermarket or refrigerated cabinet.

  Other bottled water products on the market

  21                  Natural Waters emphasises what it describes as the distinctive and characteristic features of Fiji Water.  Of the 100 or so different bottled waters on the Australian market at least three, each of which was available in late 2005, share three or more of these features:

  ·                    a bottle with a dominantly square shape (and square in shape where the label is affixed);

  ·                    use of a clear bottle with a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  ·                    use of a blue cap;

  ·                    use of a tropical motif featuring tropical plants including hibiscus in the pink-orange-red spectrum;

  ·                    a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label. 

  22                  Those bottled waters are called “Dancing”, “Outback” and “New Zealand Eternal”. 

  Dancing

  23                  “Dancing” is described on the bottle as “natural spring water”.  It is produced by the Pearl Group Pty Ltd.  Dancing was available in Woolworths in November 2005 and continues to be sold there and in some other outlets.  There is also evidence that it is, or has been, sold in Coles. Dancing is packaged in a bottle shape marginally wider, but otherwise virtually identical, to that of Fiji Water.  The front label is transparent and contains a motif of tropical flowers in pink and red hues, with some yellow.  The name “Dancing” is in blue capital letters. The bottle has a blue cap, tending to the shade of blue of the cap of Island Chill.  It has, on the inside of the back label, a three-dimensional effect consisting of a predominantly blue, white and green picture of a waterfall over the Sydney Opera House. 

  Outback

  24                  Outback is described on the label as “Australian 100% pure spring water” and is produced by Water Worldwide Pty Ltd. The distribution of Outback was centred in the Brisbane market in independent delicatessens and gourmet food stores as at November 2005.  The bottle is virtually identical in shape, but of marginally narrower dimensions, than the Fiji Water bottle.  It has a green cap.  The name “Outback Springwater” has the word “Outback” in red capital letters outlined by white and “Springwater” in half blue, half white capital letters.  The front label is transparent and there is a three-dimensional effect with, on the inside of the back label, green fern fronds against a darker green background. 

  New Zealand Eternal

  25                  New Zealand Eternal is in a bottle with a square face but elongated in shape, more like the shape of the Island Chill bottle, but rounded.  It is produced by Mead International Limited.  New Zealand Eternal was available for sale in Woolworths in November 2005.  It is described on the transparent front label as “Artesian Water Silica Rich”.  The bottle has a blue cap.  Also on the front label is a tropical flower motif featuring three red hibiscuses.  There is a three-dimensional effect with the inside of the back label portraying a regional Pacific map with New Zealand in the centre in orange, yellow, brown and white.

  26                  As at the date of the first marketing of Island Chill in Australia in December 2005, it cannot be said that the following characteristics, individually, were unique to the get-up of Fiji Water:

  (1)               use of a clear bottle with a recessed central body portion defined by protruding shoulders and base portions, with the label positioned in the recessed body portion;

  (2)               use of a blue cap;

  (3)               use of a colourful, tropical motif featuring tropical plants;

  (4)               a three-dimensional effect created by having a partially transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of the back label;

  (5)               a predominantly blue and white effect on the inner side of the back label;

  (6)               the depiction of a body of water on the inner side of the back label;

  (7)               green ferns on the inner side of the back label. 

  27                  Each of features (1) to (6) is present in the bottle of Dancing.  Dancing has been distributed in at least one major supermarket chain.  There is no evidence of the extent of such distribution or, indeed, other relevant evidence about the product.  Dayals have not established that these other bottled waters affect the perceived distinctiveness of the 2003 or 2005 get-ups.  However, Natural Waters has not established that a single aspect of its get-up or a combination of some of those features were distinctive of Fiji Water ([60] below).

  28                  The parties agree that the principles in Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited (2000) 202 CLR 45 apply in ascertaining whether there has been misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Act or the Fair Trading Act.  The subject matter of this litigation is bottled water.  The conduct is tested as against the ordinary or reasonable member of the class of prospective purchasers of this product (Campomar at [103]).  A potential purchaser does not come to a decision with the benefit of argument as to the similarities and differences between two get-ups but is likely to make his or her decision in a relatively short period of time and in conditions which may vary (Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [133]). 

  29                  Natural Waters did not adduce evidence of consumer association between aspects of the 2003 get-up or the 2005 get-up (together ‘the Fiji Water get-up’) and Natural Waters or Fiji Water.  That evidence could have been the subject of market research but its absence does not affect the ability of the Court to ascertain the distinctive features of Fiji Water and determine whether a consumer would be misled as to the commercial origin of Dayals’ product by the Island Chill get-up.

  30                  Dayals criticises the absence of expert evidence concerning the reputation of Natural Waters or Fiji Water and, in particular, the absence of survey evidence as to the reputation in, and public recognition of, the “constellation of features” relied upon by Natural Waters.  There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area.  Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water.  Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11]–[12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons.  As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant’s packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced (Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992)39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed).  The evidence ruled inadmissible in Cadbury seemed to concern the likelihood of deception rather than reputation (at [5]) and evidence of consumer recognition, in the form of a “chocolate sensory study” was admitted (Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [69]). 

  The manner of assessment

  31                  The determination of passing off and of contravention of the Act and the Fair Trading Act is assessed as a matter of impression based on recollection of the Fiji Water get-up and the Island Chill get-up.  Whether a get-up so nearly resembles another as to be deceptive or likely to deceive is a question for the Court (Interlego at 387).  The packaging must be viewed as a whole (Sterling Winthrop Pty Limited v R & C Products Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41,308 at 42,126).  It is not a question of comparing the bottles side by side and engaging in a minute and detailed analysis of the similarities and differences.  The observations of Windeyer J in The Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 415 as to the assessment of deceptive similarity in a trade mark context are apposite.  The goods in question are inexpensive consumer goods: bottled water, where the item is purchased for a relatively small price without long consideration and where the consumer is unlikely to engage in lengthy or detailed comparison of the respective get-ups (Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 152 at 161).  A consumer choosing between bottles of water on display would be likely to base the choice of purchase of his or her favoured bottled water product largely on recognition of the packaging.

  Intention

  32                  Intent is not a necessary element of passing off or contravention of s 52 or s 53 of the Act although it may be relevant if it is shown that there was an intention to deceive (Apand Pty Ltd v Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496).  This may give rise to an inference that the attempt succeeded and that consumers will be deceived (Sydneywide at [117]).  Where there is an intention to copy all or part of a competitor’s get-up to obtain a market benefit, differences in get-up may have reduced significance.

  33                  As Weinberg and Dowsett JJ said in Sydneywide at [117]:

  ‘[W]here a trader, having knowledge of a particular market, borrows aspects of a competitor’s get-up, it is a reasonable inference that he or she believes that there will be a market benefit in so doing.  Often, the obvious benefit will be the attraction of custom which would otherwise have gone to the competitor.  It is an available inference from those propositions that the trader, with knowledge of the market, considered that such borrowing was “fitted for the purpose and therefore likely to deceive or confuse…”. Of course, the trader may explain his or her conduct in such a way as to undermine the availability of that inference.  Obviously, this reasoning will only apply where there are similarities in get-up which suggest borrowing.’  (my emphasis)

  34                  Further, powerful though the inference that their Honours identified in Sydneywide may be, ‘mere proof of the fact that a person has deliberately copied the name or get-up of a trade rival does not of itself establish a contravention of s 52 or a passing off of goods or services’ (Apand at 496).  The Court must still be satisfied that the consequence is a likelihood of deception or a passing off of one product for another.  

  35                  Natural Waters placed reliance on two cases: Remy Martin v Carlton Wines & Spirits (Aust) Pty Ltd (unreported, O’Loughlin J, 19 February 1992) and Sydneywide.

  Remy Martin

  36                  In Remy Martin, the comparison was between “Liquore Galliano” and “Valentino”.  Justice O’Loughlin found that “Liquore Galliano” was a product that ‘virtually “owns” its niche within the liqueur market…it is thereby unique and…its unchanged labelling and get-up have become distinctive and synonymous (sic) with its uniqueness’ (at [106]).  The accused bottles were very different in shape and it was said to be “impossible” for any person to confuse them.  The names were also different: “Galliano” and “Valentino”, with the latter name prominently displayed.  There were less important differences on the rear labels and in the writing on the front label.  The respondents denied copying but said that the goal was to obtain “a similar feel” to the Galliano label.  For example, a fort appeared on the Galliano label; a castle motif was adopted by Valentino.  The defence was that the castle was chosen not to suggest an association with Galliano but because of its Italian or European association.

  37                  Justice O’Loughlin concluded that the respondents, former franchisees of Galliano products, set about to “filch” as much of the Galliano label and get-up as they thought would be safe to withstand legal challenge (at [114]).  His Honour found that the choice of a castle was an attempt to attract the eye of the intending purchaser in the hope that he or she would mistake the product for the Galliano range (at [115]).  It ‘destroyed the bona fides of the respondents’ case’ (at [116]).  A reference to a cocktail associated with Galliano also achieved a ‘marked degree of importance’ (at [117]).  Justice O’Loughlin concluded that, standing back and avoiding minutiae, there was ‘an overwhelming sense of association – as if the proprietors of “Liquore Galliano” might have decided to market their product in a different bottle with a different name’. 

  Sydneywide

  38                  In Sydneywide, two competing energy drink products, “Red Bull” and “LiveWire”, were packaged in cans of similar size and colour. The cans each had a “strong diagonal thrust” in their design.  There were significant differences, including the brand names and the forms of writing on the cans.  There was emphasis, by an expert witness at trial, on what was described as the “gestalt” of the brand, in the sense of ‘[a]n integrated perceptual structure or unity conceived, as functionally more than the sum of its parts’, which was said to be ‘almost identical’ (at [41] and [91]).

  39                  The primary judge concluded that Sydneywide had intentionally adopted the Red Bull get-up for its packaging for the purpose of appropriating part of its trade or reputation and that it had selected a get-up which would “sail as close to the wind” as it thought expedient (Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd v Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd (2001) 53 IPR 481 at [47]).  That finding formed an important basis for his Honour’s conclusion that there was passing off and breach of s 52 of the Act as it led to the finding that there was scope for a purchaser to believe that both products emanated from the same “manufacturing stable”, especially where the different brand names were not readily discernible (Red Bull at [69], cited in Sydneywide at [47]).

  40                  Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, with whom Branson J agreed discussed, at [55] and following, the elements of passing off and the relevance of the intent of the party accused.  Their Honours concluded (at [62]) that there is no requirement that there be an actual, subjective intention to mislead; the misrepresentation need only be likely to lead the public to believe that the goods are those of the applicant.

  41                  There were differences in the get-up and the brand name.  The relevance of the differences depended on the opportunity which a potential purchaser would have to observe those distinctions (at [72]).  The parties adduced expert evidence before the primary judge of the likely behaviour of shoppers or consumers with respect to the products there in dispute.  The evidence, as well as “experience and common sense”, suggested that relatively little attention would be given to the choice of a particular item for removal from the refrigerator for purchase (at [74]).

  42                  Weinberg and Dowsett JJ considered at [107] the difference between and prominence of the brand names.  The brand names were said to have similar associated connotations.  Their Honours said that, where the purchaser may have in mind the connotations of the name rather than the name itself, such similarities may tend to undermine what might otherwise be a basis for clear distinction.  Similar colour combinations and the diagonal thrust of design, notwithstanding the fact that other minor players in the market traded under similar colours, affected the Court’s conclusion that there was a capacity to deceive.

  The causes of action

  43                  Natural Waters’ case as pleaded against Artesian Waters alleges contraventions of ss 52, 53(c) and 53(d) of the Act and passing off.  A separate case for s 53(c) and (d) was not pursued in submissions.  It is alleged against Mr Dayal and Mr Pranesh Dayal that they have:

  ·                    been knowingly concerned, within the meaning of s 75B of the Act, in the alleged contraventions of the Act by Artesian Waters;

  ·                    contravened the equivalent provisions of the Fair Trading Act (ss 42, 44(e) and 44(f)); and

  ·                    engaged in passing off as joint tortfeasors with Artesian Waters. 

  Section 52 of the Act and passing off

  44                  Section 52 and its equivalent provision in the Fair Trading Act provide wider protection from deception (Campomar at [97]) but neither party has sought to rely on the distinction between the elements necessary to establish a contravention of s 52 and those to establish passing off.  The question is what Island Chill would convey to a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable member of the class constituted by prospective purchasers of bottled water and whether that person would be mislead or deceived, or be likely to be misled or deceived, to conclude that Island Chill had sponsorship, association, approval or connection with Fiji Water or Natural Waters that it does not have (Campomar at [102]–[105]). 

  45                  Whether Dayals is passing off its goods as those of Natural Waters depends on the reputation attached to Fiji Water’s identifying get-up so that it is distinctive of bottled water sold by Natural Waters; a representation by Dayals leading or likely to lead consumers to believe that Island Chill is the product of Natural Waters; and actual or probable damage (Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 per Lord Oliver; TGI Friday’s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday’s Inc (1999) 45 IPR 43 at [25]; Sydneywide at [60]).  Where a get-up of a product is distinctive of that product and its trade source, there may be passing off and contravention of the Act and the Fair Trading Act even though the products bear different brands or labels.

  46                  The fact that Natural Waters may establish reputation in the Fiji Water get-up does not mean that it has a monopoly over each aspect of that get-up.  The goods are ordinary articles of consumption.  By their nature, goods of different manufacturers will bear some resemblance to each other.  Water is sold in bottles, frequently in transparent bottles and commonly with blue caps.  The marks, brands and labels play an important part in distinguishing the goods of one manufacturer from those of another (Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 200 per Gibbs CJ).  Whether the reason for the distinctiveness of Fiji Water is one or more particular aspects of its packaging or the totality of its get-up, the offending product will only mislead or deceive consumers where it has taken the distinctive aspect(s) or so much of the totality of the get-up that the overall impression or the “gestalt” of the Fiji Water brand ([38] above) is adopted.  If Dayals adopted an aspect of the get-up for its product, that fact alone does not dictate a finding of passing off (Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 851 at 867; Cadbury (No 4) at [83]).

  47                  In Cadbury (No 4) at [84], Heerey J spoke of the “brand architecture” of, in that case, ‘the name “Cadbury”, the colour purple, the glass and a half device etc’.  His Honour pointed out that ‘[t]he architecture of a building involves the whole, not just one component such as a roof or wall’.  In other words, it is relevant to assess the evidence of reputation to determine which aspects of Fiji Water or its get-up are associated with Natural Waters and to ascertain whether or not the Dayals product has taken or adopted or displayed sufficient of those aspects to lead to a conclusion of passing off.  That assessment of the evidence as to reputation is also relevant to the determination of whether Dayals’ conduct is likely to mislead or deceive consumers in contravention of s 52 of the Act ([44] above). 

  The reputation of Fiji Water

  48                  Fiji Water was the first water from Fiji marketed in Australia.  Fiji Water was first available for sale in Fiji and the United States of America in 1997 and in Australia in April 2003.  Natural Waters does not suggest that it has any right to prevent the sale of bottled water from Fiji or that it has any property right in the use of the word “Fiji” for the purpose of describing the geographical source of a water product bottled in Fiji. 

  49                  Ms Schmidt was the General Manager of the second applicant between March 2003 and April 2006.  She is now the Director of Marketing at Fiji Water LLC and, in the course of her duties, visits various countries where Fiji Water is distributed for sale including Australia.  Ms Schmidt’s evidence is that Fiji Water is sold in Australia in retail outlets such as cafes, bars, restaurants, convenience stores and in supermarket chains.  It is offered for sale at both “on-premise” (consumed at the point of purchase) and “off-premise” (consumed away from the point of purchase) establishments. 

  50                  In on-premise locations, it is generally served in the bottle, giving the consumer sustained exposure to the material appearing on the bottle.  It is offered for sale in large refrigerators shared with other beverages; it may be displayed in a separate Fiji Water fridge which contains only Fiji Water; it may be purchased by name from a menu; or it may be purchased in the rooms of guests at a hotel where it is placed on display.

  51                  As to off-premise locations, Fiji Water has been sold in fine food emporiums, health food markets and independent grocery and green grocery stores “in trendy suburbs and/or high-income earning suburbs” and in city convenience stores.  Since November 2005 the off-premise trade channels include supermarkets, petrol shops and convenience stores in suburban areas.  Fiji Water is also sold for consumption off-premise in a variety of ways.  It may be displayed in a self-service refrigerating facility shared with other goods; in a self-service fridge housing only beverages; unchilled on a shelf shared with other consumable goods; on a stand allocated solely for Fiji Water; or displayed refrigerated or unrefrigerated in a facility or on a shelf shared with other consumable goods but requiring staff assistance.  In each case the get-up of Fiji Water is prominently on display to consumers.

  52                  Natural Waters has focussed its marketing strategy on “trend setting” consumers and retailers and on ensuring prominent display at selected events and locations with the aim of encouraging recognition of the Fiji Water get-up. It is marketed as a “unique water” by emphasising the square shaped bottle, the artesian nature of the product, the silica content in the product and the fact that the product ‘is sourced from an “untouched”, remote and tropical Fijian paradise’.  It is also marketed as “healthy water” by, among other things, associating it with a holiday destination.  Fiji Water is sold in Australia in 500 ml and 1 litre square bottles.  Ms Schmidt says that the common underlying tone in both the 2003 and 2005 get-up is ‘that of the tropical Fijian paradise, with associations with concepts of purity, virginal ecosystem[s], and natural water source’.

  53                 Natural Waters has marketed Fiji Water extensively.  During 2004, the first full year of trade in Australia, 50,000 cases of Fiji Water were sold, each case containing twenty-four 500 ml or twelve 1 litre bottles of water.  That increased in 2005 to 87,000 cases and is expected substantially to have increased in 2006.  It would seem that Natural Waters and Dayals’ products are intended to be sold to the same broad class of persons and through broadly similar retail outlets, albeit that Island Chill is generally sold at a cheaper price than Fiji Water. 

  54                  Natural Waters has expended significant sums of money in the marketing of Fiji Water, including the maintenance of attractive point of sale displays, event sponsorship, product placement in television shows and movies or with celebrities, outdoor billboard advertising and advertising in the print media.  Ms Schmidt’s evidence elaborated upon the nature and extent of the advertising and media exposure of Fiji Water as well as promotional activities with which it has been associated.  The aim of Natural Waters’ promotional activities is said by Ms Schmidt to ensure that the get-up is on prominent display with the intention, inter alia, of building brand recognition and increasing public awareness of the product.  Promotional items include a branded barrel fridge, umbrella, stand alone refrigerator for installation in bars and nightclubs, stock display stands and banners for use at promotional events.  Natural Waters has also marketed Fiji Water as a “celebrity water”; that is, a water consumed by film and television stars in Hollywood.

  55                  Photographic evidence of Natural Waters’ promotional activities emphasise different individual features of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups.  For example, promotional umbrellas place a strong emphasis on the words “The Taste of Paradise” and the white orchid but do not emphasise the inner back label image or the hibiscus.

  56                  Natural Waters submits that, through its extensive marketing and promotion of Fiji Water in Australia and internationally, Fiji and the Fiji Islands have come to be associated with pure drinking water.  From April 2003 until December 2005, there was only one such bottled water product.  That product was, Natural Waters contends, presented in a unique shape with a unique three-dimensional design configuration as part of its “constellation of features”.  As a consequence, Natural Waters submits, consumers are less likely to attend to differences between the Fiji Water and Island Chill products.

  Consideration

  57                  Natural Waters relies on the reputation of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups.  The reputation that is relevant to the determination of liability in these proceedings is the reputation in the get-up that existed as at mid December 2005, the commencement of the conduct complained of (Pub Squash Co at 861; Anheuser-Busch v Budějovický Budvar (2002) 56 IPR 182 at [237]).  The vast majority of sales and promotional activities prior to mid December 2005 related to the 2003 get-up.  It follows that, as at the relevant date, absent any evidence to the contrary and absent evidence of reputation specific to the 2005 get-up, Natural Waters’ reputation in the 2005 get-up subsists in the features in common between the two versions and the overall impression that they both convey.

  58                  In McCormick & Co Inc v McCormick (2000) 51 IPR 102 at [81] to [88], Kenny J discussed the evidence necessary or sufficient to establish reputation in a trade mark.  Her Honour pointed out that evidence of sales and advertising may be sufficient to establish reputation despite the absence of any direct evidence of consumer appreciation of the mark, as opposed to the product: ‘public awareness of and regard for a mark tends to correlate with appreciation of the products with which the mark is associated, as evidenced by sales volume, among other things’ (at [86]).  Such factors may also establish the reputation necessary to found a case for passing off and contravention of s 52 of the Act (for example, Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 127 at [12] to [14]).

  59                  The reputation which must be proved in a case such as this is that the get-up, packaging, shape, or trade dress relied upon is associated by consumers with the applicant’s product.  It takes a strong case to establish a reputation of this nature (Interlego at 386) asconsumers will not necessarily associate a get-up with the applicant’s product (Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1398 at [33] to [34] per Lindgren J).  The requisite reputation will more readily be found where the get-up is unique or striking rather than descriptive, mundane, merely functional, or in common use. 

  60                  Natural Waters relies on a “constellation of features” which are said to be distinctive of Fiji Water.  Some of these features have been given little emphasis in the promotional activities (eg, the red hibiscus). Other features are commonly used in the bottled water market (eg, blue bottle caps) or are not unique to Fiji Water (a three-dimensional effect created by a partially transparent label).  There is no justification for concluding, on the basis of sales and marketing evidence alone, that these features individually have come to be associated by consumers with Fiji Water or Natural Waters. 

  61                  The combination of features relied upon by Natural Waters does, however, in my view give rise to an overall impression or effect.  Consumers are exposed to this effect to varying degrees when purchasing or consuming Fiji Water; indeed, the evidence is that in some instances (eg, on-premise locations) the degree of such exposure is likely to be high.  The volume of sales in Australia of bottles bearing the 2003 get-up, as at the date of the conduct complained of, is significant. Promotional activities have also been significant and the 2003 get-up has featured in those activities.  The extent of consumer exposure to the 2003 get-up is such that I am satisfied that Natural Waters has sufficient reputation in that get-up to found an action for passing off and contravention of the Act.  As at the relevant date, December 2005, the reputation in the newly marketed 2005 get-up would extend to the common features; the continued use of the name, bottle shape and style; those features that create the common “gestalt”.

  The intention of Dayals in the design of the Island Chill get-up

  62                  Mr Dayal began researching the possibilities of setting up a water bottling business in Fiji to cater for what he perceived to be a growing market demand for bottled water in 2001.  Artesian Waters purchased land for commercial production bore-wells in February 2002.  It obtained authorisation to proceed with construction in or about January 2004.  From about June 2002, Mr Dayal commenced inquiries into appropriate bottle shape, name and label designs and artwork for the Dayals product.

  63                  Mr Dayal made the decisions for Dayals on the marketing of a bottled water product from Fiji.  There is no doubt, based upon Mr Dayal’s evidence, that he was keenly aware of Fiji Water and its 2003 get-up when he made the decision to produce and distribute a bottled water from Fiji.  Indeed, Mr Dayal readily conceded that he was keenly aware of the get-up used by Fiji Water in the form of the bottle that had been sold in Fiji from 1997.

  64                 Mr Dayal referred to the Natural Waters product as “Fiji Water” without further qualification and did not provide a sample of the get-up to his designers when he instructed them to design a get-up different from that of Fiji Water.  He seemed to accept that there was no need to do so as his designers would be aware of it themselves.

  65                  Mr Dayal’s evidence is that he received numerous bottles from the market in different countries and then formulated in his mind the features of shape and design which appealed to him.  He instructed an Indian bottle blowing company to design bottles and manufacture molds for that approved design.  Mr Dayal then turned to a name for the proposed bottled water product.  He engaged the services of an American lawyer to assist in choosing a name that was available for use in the United States of America.  For a period of time, he was attracted to the name “Tranquil” and in late 2002 he commissioned a Fijian company, Kreative Designs, to design labels using that name.  In about March 2003, he became interested in the name “Island Chill” which‘was a name that [he] had come up with in that month’.

  66                  Mr Dayal instructed Kreative Designs to design a range of label options based on the new name, Island Chill.  His instructions were to design a label conveying coolness, relaxation and a tropical theme that was to be different to that of Fiji Water.  Following discussions with Philstic Labels Ltd, a graphic design and label manufacturer based in New Zealand, he concluded that a transparent rather than an opaque label would be ‘most beneficial’.  In September 2005, Philstic designed a transparent front label based on the designs of Kreative Designs which included the back label (three-dimensional) seascape.  Mr Dayal’s evidence is that he chose the lettering of strong dark blue with a white outline and left the font type to Philstic.  He says that his decision to adopt a dark blue bottle cap was affected by the colour of the lettering.  Mr Dayal readily agreed that he and Kreative Designs were aware of the 2003 get-up but not the 2005 get-up.  Whatever reference was made to the 2003 get-up in the design of Island Chill, I am not satisfied that Mr Dayal intended to appropriate the Fiji Water get-up. 

  67                  Natural Waters invites the Court to infer that Dayals set out about ‘the task of taking so much of the Fiji Water get-up as they thought would enable them to travel into the slipstream of [Natural Waters’] reputation’ with reference to:

  ·                    the rejection by Mr Dayal of earlier designs and late inclusion of features in common with the Fiji Water get-up;

  ·                    specifically, an abandoned proposal to adopt white lettering outlined in gold for “Island Chill”;

  ·                    omissions in Dayals’ evidence;

  ·                    alleged similarities between the Island Chill website and the Fiji Water website; and

  ·                    the presence of the red hibiscus in the Island Chill get-up.

  The earlier designs, late inclusion of Fiji Water features and the abandoned white and gold label

  68                  Natural Waters points to the fact that Mr Dayal obtained several earlier designs that differed substantially from that of Fiji Water, which he rejected and that he adopted features such as a transparent label and three-dimensional background label close to the launch date of Island Chill.  Mr Dayal had known of those characteristics well prior to the commencement of the design process.  He explained his process of reasoning in adopting different aspects of the Island Chill get-up as follows.  Mr Dayal was aware of New Zealand Eternal, Dancing, Fiji Water and Outback waters, which incorporated into their design a transparent front label and a three-dimensional concept involving the use of a back label with decorative artwork visible from the front perspective of the bottle through the transparent front label.   He formed the view that these design features were functional and aesthetically pleasing and suitable for use as part of a design for bottled water.  He was aware of other bottles on the market that also used characteristics such as transparent front labels and three-dimensional inside back labels.  Although his designers produced a label incorporating these features with “Island Chill” in white lettering outlined by gold, Mr Dayal ultimately rejected that label and adopted blue lettering, in lower case, outlined by white.  He chose a combination of features that were, to him, attractive and at the same time were, in his opinion, sufficiently different to those of Fiji Water clearly to differentiate them.

  69                  Natural Waters emphasises that the design of the Island Chill bottle progressed, from 2002 to 2005, by the incorporation of features from the Fiji Water get-up.  This included a move from:

  ·                    an opaque to a transparent label;

  ·                    a predominantly green colour scheme to a blue and white colour scheme with a red hibiscus;

  ·                    including “bottled at source” on the front label, to ‘bottled at source in Fiji Islands” at the bottom of the front label, to “bottled at source in Fiji Islands” in the middle of the front label in the same font and colour and “Island Chill”;

  ·                    the incorporation of “taste of perfection” on the back label where the 2003 get-up has  “taste of paradise”. 

  70                  Natural Waters places particular emphasis on the eventual use of “Bottled at Source in the Fiji Islands” and its position on the front label.  That emphasis is misplaced.  Natural Waters cannot claim a monopoly on all water from Fiji.  Natural Waters accepts that its competitors are entitled to state that the source of their water is Fiji or the Fiji Islands.  Its complaint is that it considers “Fiji” to be in “prominent use as a trade mark” in the Island Chill get-up.  That submission is rejected.  The word “Fiji” is not in use as a trade mark on the Island Chill bottle.  Although in the same colour, the words “Bottled at Source in the Fiji Islands” are in noticeably smaller font to “Island Chill”.  I am not satisfied that the reasonable consumer would consider those words to form a part of the Island Chill brand name or otherwise represent an association between Island Chill and Fiji Water.  Mr Dayal wanted to market a bottled water from Fiji.  Dayals’ use of “Fiji” evinces an intention to describe the geographical source of the Island Chill product, not an intention to appropriate the Fiji Water get-up.

  Omissions in Dayals’ evidence

  71                  The evidence of the design evolution of the Island Chill get-up was addressed in detail during the cross-examination of Mr Dayal.  There is little direct documentary evidence of the way in which that evolution took place.  Natural Waters draws attention to the lack of evidence of instructions to the designers, including evidence as to the use or otherwise to be made of the 2003 get-up of which Mr Dayal was aware and the absence of email communication over the relevant time between Mr Dayal and the designers.  Particular criticism is made of the absence of additional witnesses and of the adequacy of Dayals’ discovery.  In these circumstances, Natural Waters submits that the inference should be drawn that none of this evidence would have assisted Dayals’ case (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298).

  72                  Mr Dayal’s evidence is that he was responsible for the get-up of Island Chill.  While I accept that others made suggestions, the responsibility to “sign-off” on the get-up was his.  I accept his evidence as to the events which occurred.  No application for further and better discovery was made and I do not accept that Dayals failed to discover all relevant documents in their possession or failed to comply with their obligations of discovery.   

  The websites

  73                  Natural Waters and Dayals promote their products on the internet.  Natural Waters invites the Court to draw inferences from the similarities between Island Chill’s website (www.islandchill.com) and the Fiji Water website (www.fijiwater.com). 

  74                  The Island Chill website displays the hibiscus on each page.  The site emphasises the name Island Chill and bears little resemblance to the Fiji Water site, apart from the emphasis on the artesian source of the water and its purity.  It specifies that ‘[w]e are not associated with any other bottled water from the Fiji Islands’.  Both sites claim that their product is superior and Mr Dayal accepted that he drew his ideas in part from the Fiji Water site. 

  75                  No case is pleaded against Dayals in respect of the content of the Island Chill website.  In any event, there are sufficient differences and few similarities between the sites so that there is no impression that the Island Chill website is associated with Fiji Water or Natural Waters.  No inference as to intention arises from the content of the websites.

  The red hibiscus

  76                  Natural Waters submits that it cannot be mere coincidence that Island Chill displays a red hibiscus in a similar position to the red hibiscus in the 2005 get-up.  That submission, at first consideration, has some force.  While Mr Dayal admitted that he was aware of the 2005 get-up prior to launching the Island Chill website in “late 2005”, he also said that he was not aware of the 2005 get-up when he signed-off on the final get-up of Island Chill in September 2005.  That is reasonable, considering that Fiji Water was not marketed in the 2005 get-up in Australia until October 2005.

  77                  Much has been made of the single hibiscus.  However, that did not appear on the 2003 get-up, other than in a tropical array of flowers, differently positioned and dominated by a white orchid.  The hibiscus was not the sole flower, nor the dominant flower, nor in the same shade, nor in the same position in the 2003 get-up.  Mr Dayal was not aware of the 2005 get-up, which featured a single hibiscus, prior to the completion of the Island Chill design. 

  78                  The hibiscus was a flower adopted by other bottled water suppliers, such as Dancing.  It is a flower commonly associated with a tropical theme.  I do not accept that the flower and its location were deliberately chosen with a view to appropriating an aspect of the Fiji Water get-up.  Even if it were, it cannot be said that the sole pink hibiscus in the bottom right of the front label, as it appears in the 2005 get-up, was itself distinctive of or associated with Fiji Water when it was but one of the flowers in the 2003 get-up in which a white orchid was dominant and the red hibiscus was located in a higher position on the left side of the front label. 

  79                  Characteristics such as the transparent front label, the three-dimensional effect on the inside of the back label and a hibiscus were not created by Natural Waters nor unique to Fiji Water in the bottled water market.  Mr Dayal did not suggest that he created any of these devices.  As I have noted, there is no evidence that they were associated, in the mind of the consumer, with Fiji Water.  They were devices used in get-ups that were themselves, individually, not the subject of reputation or goodwill.  As long as there was no passing off of Fiji Water or a likelihood of deception of consumers, there was no prohibition on another bottled water manufacturer using one or more of these devices.  Mr Dayal freely acknowledged that he adopted ideas that had previously been publicly used.  His intention was to take what he thought were the best ideas in the marketplace and to create a get-up for Island Chill that maximised its attractiveness but maintained distinctiveness, in particular as against Fiji Water.  I am satisfied that he succeeded.

  Conclusion as to intention

  80                  I accept Mr Dayal’s explanation.  Mr Dayal explained the inclusion in the Island Chill get-up of each of the characteristics that are relied upon as being similar.  None of those characteristics are peculiar to Fiji Water, other than the word “Fiji”.

  81                  Mr Dayal readily conceded that he wished to take advantage of a growing world market demand for bottled water.  Mr Dayal is Fijian and the family businesses are based in Fiji.  He appreciated that Fiji was a good source from which to meet such a demand and he had the opportunity and business experience to develop that market.  Unlike O'Loughlin J in Remy Martin, I am not satisfied that Mr Dayal had the intention to market a bottled water product that would be associated with Fiji Water.  He was aware of the need to “distance” his product from Fiji Water, not least for legal reasons.  I accept Mr Dayal’s evidence of his intentions and of the process of design of Island Chill, for which he was responsible at the decision-making level.

  Would the consumer be misled into thinking that Island Chill was Fiji Water or associated with Fiji Water or Natural Waters?

  82                  I am firmly of the view that the ordinary or reasonable consumer of bottled water would not confuse Fiji Water and Island Chill or be misled, or be likely to be misled, into believing that they were in any way associated, other than both being a product of Fiji.  This is so whether the consumer paused to consider the bottles or made the choice with only a “transitory” glance.  Natural Waters emphasises the distinctive aspects of the Fiji Water get-up.  Two of the most distinctive are the square shaped bottle and the name “FIJI” in capital letters, in white, outlined by gold.  Island Chill is in a bottle with an elongated shape, totally different although square faced, from the distinctive shape of the Fiji Water bottle.  The name Island Chill is prominent and appears totally different in script, colour, name and style to the “FIJI” of Fiji Water.  Those aspects alone are, in my opinion, sufficient clearly to differentiate the two products. 

  83                  The blue cap, transparent label, three-dimensional background, tropical flower motif and colour and nature of the three-dimensional background are not displayed only on bottles of Fiji Water.  They have been utilised in Australia by other manufacturers of bottled water.  They do, however, form part of the overall impression or effect of Fiji Water, although there are differences between the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up.  In each case, the use made of these devices by Island Chill is different.  The blue cap is of a different colour; the single hibiscus is different to the 2003 get-up and of a different colour and position to the 2005 get-up; the three-dimensional scene is different and of a different predominant colour to each of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups.  Importantly, the overall effect of the combination of each aspect of the design is different and sufficiently so to differentiate Island Chill from the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up.  Unlike Sydneywide, there is no “gestalt” common to Island Chill and Fiji Water.  The products simply look different.  The ordinary consumer would not be misled or deceived into believing that they were from the same manufacturer or in some way commercially associated.  The ordinary consumer would not believe that Island Chill was the product of Natural Waters or associated with Natural Waters or Fiji Water or was a bottle of Fiji Water.

  Conclusion

  84                  Dayals may have been seeking an association between Island Chill and another subject but that subject was Fiji, a group of tropical islands, not Fiji Water.  Even if Mr Dayal had had the intention to appropriate the commercial or other advantages to be gained by association with Fiji Water, he failed.

  85                  Natural Waters has not established that, by marketing Island Chill in Australia, Artesian Waters has passed off its product as Fiji Water.  Nor has it been established that Artesian Waters has contravened ss 52 or 53 of the Act.

  86                  It follows that Mr Dayal and Mr Pranesh Dayal have not been knowingly concerned in any contravention of the Act by Artesian Waters.  Nor have they themselves contravened ss 42 or 44 of the Fair Trading Act or engaged in passing off.

  87                  Natural Waters foreshadowed the making of a special costs application in its written submissions.  I direct the parties to file and serve written submissions on costs or consent orders as to costs within fourteen (14) days.

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Procedure ‑‑ Indictment ‑‑ Preliminary inquiry ‑‑Accused
charged with offence which did not exist at relevant time and committed for
trial following preliminary inquiry ‑‑ Error detected at beginning
of trial and new indictment presented ‑‑ Whether Crown could only
proceed by means of direct indictment requiring Attorney General's consent ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 577 .

 

                   In 1986 the accused
was charged with six counts of sexual assault arising out of acts allegedly
committed in July and September of 1982.  The charges were made pursuant to
s. 271 (formerly s. 246.1) of the Criminal Code , which was not
proclaimed in force until January 4, 1983, a few months after the acts in
question had occurred.  The amending legislation specifically provided that the
new provisions were not to apply retroactively.  The accused elected to be
tried by judge and jury and a preliminary inquiry was held.  When it was
completed the accused was committed to stand trial.  At the beginning of the
trial, the accused, having detected the error, moved to quash the indictment. 
The Crown conceded that he had been charged with a crime that did not exist,
and then immediately presented the court with a new indictment charging the
accused with six indecent assaults under the provisions of the former
s. 149(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The trial judge quashed the first
indictment and accepted the new one.  The accused brought a motion seeking to
quash the new indictment, contending that the Crown could only proceed by means
of a direct indictment which would require the personal signature of the
Attorney General.  Section 577 of the Code provides that where a
preliminary inquiry has not been held or where a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged, an indictment shall not be preferred
without the consent of the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.  This
motion was rejected, the trial proceeded and the accused was convicted on four
of the six counts.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, dismissed the
appeal against conviction.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   While this Court's
decision in Chase differentiates between charges of sexual assault under
s. 271 of the Code and indecent assault under the former
s. 149(1) , in this case there was nonetheless full disclosure of the events
which formed the basis of the Crown's case against the accused.  The incidents
upon which the charges were based were thoroughly explored at the preliminary
inquiry.  There is no doubt that evidence as to the events which occurred
justified proceeding with the charges of sexual assault; equally, the same
evidence clearly justified proceeding with the charges of indecent assault.  No
prejudice has been occasioned to the accused by the quashing of the original
indictment and the preferring of the second indictment.  The original
indictment was valid in every respect except for the nomenclature used to
identify the offence.  The parties proceeded throughout the preliminary inquiry
on the assumption it was valid.  The evidence identified the actions which constituted
the incidents of sexual assault or indecent assault, depending on the title
used.  The actions were the same, the evidence was the same.  The testimony
given at the preliminary inquiry constituted a prima facie case that the
accused had committed an offence described as indecent assault prior to
January 4, 1983 and sexual assault thereafter.  In the circumstances the
error in the ""labelling"" or title of the offence constituted a
voidable error, and not one that was void.  It follows that it was in order for
the Crown to present a fresh indictment which conformed to the evidence adduced
at a preliminary hearing whose validity had not been challenged.

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Cory J. -- In 1986
the appellant was charged with six counts of sexual assault alleging that he
had fondled and touched a ten-year-old girl in July and September of 1982.  The
charges were made pursuant to s. 271  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46  (formerly s. 246.1 ), which provides:

 

                   271. (1)Every one who commits a sexual
assault is guilty of

 

(a)
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
ten years; or

 

(b)
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   This section was
added to the Criminal Code  by an amending Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c.
125, s. 19 .  It was not proclaimed in force until January 4, 1983, which
was, of course, a few months subsequent to the occurrence of the acts which led
to the charges brought against the accused.  The Criminal Code  amendment
Act specifically provided in s. 33  that the new provisions were not to apply
retroactively.  That section reads:

 

                   33.  An offence committed prior to the
coming into force of this Act against any provision of law affected by this Act
shall be dealt with in all respects as if this Act had not come into force.

 

                   For some
considerable time, no one noticed the error in the indictment.  In due course
the appellant elected to be tried by judge and jury.  A preliminary inquiry was
held.  When it was completed the appellant was committed to stand trial.  He
then re-elected trial by a provincial court judge. 

 

                   The error was
eventually detected at the beginning of the trial in May 1987.  Before he had
entered a plea the appellant moved to quash the indictment on the ground that
the offences with which he was charged did not exist at the relevant time.  The
hearing of this motion was postponed until the following day.  When the
proceedings resumed, the Crown conceded, before the trial judge could rule on
the motion, that the appellant had been charged with a crime that did not
exist.  The Crown then immediately presented the Court with a new indictment
charging the appellant with six indecent assaults under the provisions of the
former s. 149(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  That
section reads:

 

                   149. (1)  Every one who indecently
assaults a female person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years.

 

                   The trial judge
quashed the first indictment alleging six sexual assaults and accepted the new
indictment alleging six indecent assaults.

 

                   The appellant
brought a number of pre-trial motions; only that seeking to quash the new
indictment is pertinent to this appeal.  It was contended that on the new
indictment the Crown could only proceed by means of a direct indictment which
would require the personal signature of the Attorney General pursuant to
s. 577  (formerly s. 507) of the Criminal Code .  That section
reads:

 

                   577.     In any prosecution,

 

(a)
where a preliminary inquiry has not been held, an indictment shall not be
preferred, or

 

(b)
where a preliminary inquiry has been held and the accused has been discharged,
an indictment shall not be preferred or a new information shall not be laid

 

before
any court without,

 

(c)
where the prosecution is conducted by the Attorney General or the Attorney
General intervenes in the prosecution, the personal consent in writing of the
Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, or

 

(d)
where the prosecution is conducted by a prosecutor other than the Attorney
General and the Attorney General does not intervene in the prosecution, the
written order of a judge of that court.

 

                   This motion was
rejected by the trial judge.  

 

                   The trial then
proceeded and the appellant was convicted on four of the six counts.  He was
sentenced to eight months' imprisonment plus a period of probation.

 

                   Both the conviction
and the sentence were appealed and on February 21, 1991 the Quebec Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction with a dissent by
Fish J.A.  The sentence appeal was allowed and the period of imprisonment
reduced to time served (7 days).  The appeal is before this Court as of right
in light of the dissent by Fish J.A.  

 

Judgment of the Courts Below

 

Quebec Court of Sessions of the Peace
(Gagnon Prov. Ct. J.). 

 

                   The trial judge
held that the new or the substituted indictment should not be quashed.  In his
view, s. 577 of the Code did not apply to this case.  Pursuant to the
section, the consent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment is only
required when a preliminary inquiry has not been held or when the accused has
been discharged after a preliminary inquiry.  In his view a preliminary inquiry
had indeed been held in this case.  He held:

 

[translation]  There was a preliminary
inquiry and [the appellant] was not discharged by that inquiry.  He was
committed for trial for sexual assault.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   It
is true that the committal for trial was for offences other than those now
indicated on the indictment.  Section 504(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
provides that the prosecutor, here the Attorney General's prosecutor, may
prefer an indictment against any person who has been ordered to stand trial in
respect of ""any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence
taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for
any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, whether or not the
charges were included in one information"".

 

                   This
court has accordingly referred to the evidence taken at the preliminary
inquiry.  After reviewing that evidence, the court concludes that the offences
of indecent assault with which the accused is charged are disclosed by that
evidence.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   The trial judge
thus determined that the indictment did not have to be signed by the Attorney
General and could be preferred by his prosecutor.

 

Quebec Court of Appeal,  [1991] R.J.Q. 741, 37 Q.A.C. 214

 

                   Malouf J.A. gave
the reasons of the majority.  Monet J.A. filed separate reasons concurring in
the result while Fish J.A. dissented.  Malouf J.A. observed that pursuant to
s. 574  of the Criminal Code  an indictment can be preferred in
respect of any charge founded on the facts disclosed in evidence at the
preliminary hearing.  Section 574  provides:

 

                   574.     (1) Subject to subsection (3) and
section 577 , the prosecutor may prefer an indictment against any person who has
been ordered to stand trial in respect of

 

(a)               any
charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, or

 

(b) 
any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for any charge on which
that person was ordered to stand trial,

 

whether
or not the charges were included in one information.

 

                   Malouf J.A. found
that all the requirements of s. 574  were met in this case.  The preliminary
hearing provided evidence which disclosed the offence of indecent assault.  As
a result, the new indictment charging the accused with indecent assault did not
require the Attorney General's signature.  When he read the reasons of his
colleagues, Malouf J.A. added to his own reasons.  He observed that the
appellant in this case had every opportunity to make full answer and defence. 
At the time of the substituted indictment of indecent assault, the accused
(appellant) had been completely informed as to the evidence pertaining to the
offence with which he was charged and had received all the benefits that a
preliminary inquiry can provide.  In his view, no prejudice had been occasioned
by the substitution of the new indictment.  He noted as well that the
procedural point upon which Fish J.A. based his dissent was not raised
before the trial court or argued before the Court of Appeal.  The parties had
not been given an  opportunity to review the issue and in his opinion the Court
of Appeal should decline to decide that issue. 

 

                   Monet J.A. in
concurring reasons agreed that the original indictment was flawed.  Further he
conceded that R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, established that the
offences of indecent assault and sexual assault were not identical.  However,
he went on to  observe that for the victim the terminology was unimportant. 
For society, the reprobation was precisely the same.  For the accused in this
case, the acts under investigation were identified and the circumstances
surrounding those acts were fully investigated at the preliminary inquiry.  The
accused had been committed for trial and this committal had not been attacked
by the accused.  It followed that in his view the new indictment signed by the
Attorney General's prosecutor was valid.  

 

                   Fish J.A.
found that the Crown was bound to prefer a direct indictment in the circumstances
of this case.  Although the appellant's focus was on s. 577 (b), which
pertains to indictments preferred when a preliminary inquiry has been held,
Fish J.A. based his reasons on s. 577 (a).  He concluded the
preliminary inquiry was a nullity and as a result it could not be said that
there had been a de facto preliminary inquiry which led to a committal
for trial.

 

                   In his view there
could be no legal and valid trial on the first indictment because it disclosed
no offence.  It followed that there could be no legal and valid inquiry on an
information framed in such a way that it did not disclose an offence.  In his opinion
there was no jurisdiction to hold the preliminary inquiry based on an
information that was invalid.  In the result the preliminary inquiry and
committal to trial were void ab initio.  

 

                   Fish J.A. conceded
that there were strong arguments in favour of the validity of the indictment. 
He too observed that the essential elements of the charge which were
investigated at the preliminary inquiry were, in fact, substantially if not
legally identical to those for which the appellant was eventually tried.  Thus
the appellant was fully apprised of the Crown's case against him.  Further,
there was evidence adduced upon which the appellant could properly be committed
to trial.  Thus all the policy requirements were satisfied, although the legal
requirements were not.  In his view there had been no preliminary hearing and
no committal to trial and as a result there could be no indictment preferred
under s. 574(1)(b). 

 

Issue

                   The sole point in
issue raised by the dissent of Fish J.A. is this:

 

1.                Was
the indictment invalid because it did not conform to s. 577  of the Criminal
Code ?

 

Analysis

 

                   At the outset it
must be emphasized that the appellant is relying on a very technical argument. 
He does not allege that there has been any prejudice whatsoever.  Nonetheless
he relies on the defect in the original indictment to argue that he did not
have a valid preliminary inquiry.  In these circumstances it is appropriate to
respond to a technical objection with a technical answer.  In order to deal
with the appellant's argument it is necessary to look once again at the object
of the preliminary inquiry.

 

Preliminary Inquiry

 

                   Today the prime
function of a preliminary inquiry is to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to commit the accused to trial.  Section 535  of the Criminal Code 
requires the ""justice"" to ""inquire into that charge and any
other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the
facts that are disclosed by the evidence..."".  The preliminary inquiry has
a long history.  Prior to the establishment of permanent police forces it was
as much a process for the investigation of crime as it was for determining the
probable guilt of the accused.

 

                   Pursuant to
s. 548 , when all the evidence is taken, if in the justice's opinion there
is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offence charged, or
any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction, the justice
shall order the accused to stand trial.  Pursuant to subs. 2 of the same
section where the justice orders the accused to stand trial for an indictable
offence other than or in addition to the one with which the accused was
charged, the justice shall endorse on the information the charges on which the
accused is ordered to stand trial.

 

                   It cannot be denied
that the preliminary hearing permits the accused to discover the extent of the
case against him.  It is true that in Caccamo v. The Queen, [1976]
1 S.C.R. 786, this Court made it clear that the Crown has a
discretion to present only that evidence which makes out a prima facie
case.  Nonetheless the fact remains that the preliminary does permit an accused
person to explore to some extent the Crown's case.  

 

                   Once again I would
emphasize that in this case there was no lack of discovery and no prejudice
whatsoever to the accused.  It is true that Chase, supra, differentiates
between charges of sexual assault under s. 271 of the Code and
indecent assault under the former s. 149(1).  Nonetheless in this
particular case there was full disclosure of the events which formed the basis
of the Crown's case against the appellant.  The incidents upon which the
charges were based were thoroughly explored at the preliminary inquiry.  There
is no doubt that evidence as to the events which transpired justified
proceeding with the charges of sexual assault.  Equally, the same evidence
clearly justified proceeding with the charges of indecent assault.  The fact
that there has been no possible prejudice occasioned to the appellant by the
process adopted in this case is not without significance to the resolution of
this appeal.

 

                   The appellant
contends that despite the fact that there has been no practical prejudice there
is a legal prejudice.  That submission cannot be accepted.  When the appellant
discovered the error in the original charge, a motion was made to quash the
indictment on the ground the offences with which he was charged did not exist
at the time he was alleged to have committed them.  In R. v. Chabot,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, Dickson J. (as he then was) held that once
an indictment is preferred, it is no longer possible to attack by procedural
means a committal to trial.  He wrote (at p. 990):

 

                   The
Court of Appeal concluded, I think correctly, that at some point the indictment
becomes the operative document in the criminal process.  At that point, the
indictment provides a ""fresh starting point"".  The indictment in
effect becomes the foundation upon which the further proceedings are built. 
After presentment of the indictment, the accused is free to move to quash the
indictment by motion made in the trial court but he can no longer attack the
regularity of the committal for trial by certiorari.

 

                   It is important to
note that nothing in the motion to quash the first indictment indicates that
the appellant questioned the validity of any of the earlier proceedings.  It
was only at this point that the appellant realized, necessarily for the first
time, that the initial charges did not reveal crimes in existence at the time
of the alleged offences.  Yet the appellant attacked neither the preliminary
inquiry, alleging a lack of jurisdiction, nor the committal to trial, alleging
it to be a nullity.  The trial judge was simply asked to quash an indictment
based on a defect apparent on its face.  At this stage, therefore, the
preliminary hearing had not been attacked or criticized in any way.  The
appellant's subsequent motion to quash the new indictment was based upon a
contention that a preliminary inquiry had been held and that the accused had
been discharged.  This combination of events, according to defence counsel,
pursuant to s. 577 (b) required that any subsequent indictment be
preferred directly.  I disagree.

 

                   The original
indictment charging sexual assault rather than indecent assault was valid in
every respect except for the nomenclature used to identify the offence.  The parties
proceeded throughout the preliminary inquiry on the assumption it was valid. 
The evidence identified the actions which constituted the incidents of sexual
assault or indecent assault, depending on the title used to identify the
touching or fondling.  The actions were the same, the evidence was the same. 
The testimony given at the preliminary inquiry constituted a prima facie
case that the accused had committed an offence described as indecent assault
prior to January 4, 1983 and sexual assault thereafter.

 

                   In the
circumstances the error in the ""labelling"" or title of the offence
constituted a voidable error and not one that was void.  The situation might be
different if an entirely new offence had been instituted by the legislation of
January 4, 1983.  For example, if it was only after that date that ""air
piracy"" was declared an offence, then an indictment alleging that the
accused had committed air piracy prior to that date would be void as it would
not disclose a crime known to the law at the relevant time.  Similarly, in this
case, if the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing had established a prima
facie case of sexual assault, but not of indecent assault, then the
indictment would have been void as it would not have disclosed an offence known
to the law at the relevant time.  It follows that, in the circumstances of this
case, it was in order for the Crown to present a fresh indictment which
conformed to the evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing whose validity had
not been challenged.  The Crown, at that point, proceeded in accordance with s.
574(1)  of the Criminal Code .  See McKibbon v. The Queen, [1984] 1
S.C.R. 131; R. v. Copeland (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 186 (B.C.C.A.).

 

                   There were many
avenues open to the defence in the present case.  Had defence counsel moved
before or during the preliminary inquiry to challenge the jurisdiction of the
magistrate, it undoubtedly would have resulted in the laying of a new
information and the holding of a preliminary inquiry on the charges of indecent
assault.  Had defence counsel made a motion at any time after the preliminary
inquiry and the subsequent committal but before an indictment was preferred in
the Chabot sense of the term, again the result would likely have been
successful.  After the preferment of the indictment for sexual assault, defence
counsel could have challenged both this indictment and the jurisdiction of the
magistrate who had presided over the preliminary inquiry.  This would have left
nothing upon which to base Crown counsel's second indictment.  These are but
examples of remedies that the defence might have utilized.  None were explored.

 

                   In summary, the
original indictment erred in the name or title the offences were given.  The
acts of the appellant amounted to indecent assault prior to January 4, 1983 and
to sexual assault thereafter.  The preliminary inquiry established that there
was a prima facie case against the appellant.  The incidents described
in the testimony could be entitled as indecent assault prior to January 4, 1983. 
The same incidents could be described as sexual assault after January 4, 1983. 
No prejudice has been occasioned to the accused by the quashing of the original
indictment and the preferring of the second indictment.  Only the name of the
offence was changed.  In the particular circumstances of this case, it was
appropriate, in light of the unchallenged preliminary inquiry, for the Crown to
immediately prefer a new indictment pursuant to s. 574(1) .  This created a
proper foundation for the ensuing trial and conviction.

 

                   In the result, I
would dismiss the appeal and confirm the conviction of the appellant for
indecent assault.  

 

                   Appeal dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility —
Hearsay — Drug purchase call — Implied Assertions — Implied assertion tendered
for the truth of its contents — Applicability of hearsay rule — Purposive approach — Principled analysis of its
necessity and reliability.

                    After
B was arrested, a caller telephoned B’s cell phone to arrange for a drug
delivery.  A police officer answered B’s cell phone and agreed to deliver the
drugs at the price that B usually charged.  The caller gave his address.  No
effort was made to find and interview him and he was not called as a witness.  The
trial judge concluded that the police officer’s testimony was not hearsay and
admitted the contents of the call.  B was convicted of possessing marijuana and
cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.  A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal, ordered a new trial, and held that the evidence should not have
been admitted.

                    Held:
 The appeal should be dismissed and a new trial ordered.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Karakatsanis
and Wagner JJ.:  The hearsay rule reflects the value our criminal justice
system places on live, in‑court testimony.  The defining features of
hearsay are (1) the fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth
of its contents and (2) the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to
cross‑examine the declarant.  Hearsay evidence is presumptively
inadmissible as a matter of law.  The issue here is whether this exclusionary rule
applies to express hearsay only, or to implied hearsay as well.  An implied
assertion tendered for the truth of its contents does not stand on a different
footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an explicit assertion to the
same effect.  The principled reasons for their presumptive inadmissibility
apply equally to both.  There is no principled reason, in determining their
admissibility, to distinguish between express and implied assertions adduced
for the truth of their content. 

                    Hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it falls under a traditional exception
to the hearsay rule.  If hearsay evidence does not fall under a hearsay exception,
it may still be admitted if, pursuant to the principled analysis, sufficient indicia
of reliability and necessity are established on a voir dire.  Hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible because of the difficulties inherent in
testing the reliability of the declarant’s assertion.  The need for a
functional approach to implied assertions is readily apparent, bearing in mind
the core hearsay dangers of the declarant’s perception, memory, narration and
sincerity. 

                    Here,
no traditional exception applies and the impugned evidence withers on a
principled analysis.  This was a single drug purchase call of uncertain
reliability.  No effort was made to find and interview the caller, still less
to call him as a witness — where the assertion imputed to him could have been
evaluated by the trier of fact in the light of cross‑examination and the
benefit of observing his demeanour.  Although this drug purchase call does not
withstand scrutiny under the principled approach, this need not always be the
case with drug purchase calls.

                    Finally,
the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
can have no application in this case, since it cannot be said that there is no
reasonable possibility the verdict would have been different had the telephone
call not been admitted.

                    Per Moldaver J.:
 An implied assertion of a factual proposition is part of the “contents” of a
statement for purposes of the hearsay rule.  Accordingly, the evidence of the
drug purchase call was hearsay because it was introduced to prove that B was in
fact a drug trafficker.  In such cases, however, the real concern under the
principled approach is reliability and it should be the focus of the inquiry.  The
necessity criterion has its purpose, but it is not meant to stifle the
admission of reliable evidence.  Rather, it is founded on society’s interest in
getting at the truth.  For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the
prospect of locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a
forthcoming and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it
should be admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in
order to get closer to the truth.  If the evidence is not reliable, it should
be excluded.

                    The
starting point is that a long line of cases have admitted evidence similar to
that at issue here on the basis that it was non-hearsay.  Because judges are
not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, these earlier
cases appear to rest on the conclusion that drug purchase calls are reliable
more often than not and, thus, can safely be categorized as non-hearsay.  Even
where such evidence was excluded, the concern was reliability.  The common
thread in these cases is that the evidence’s reliability dictated the answer
with respect to admissibility — and that is the assessment courts should focus
on.

                    The
majority’s analogy to an earlier decision of this Court to support its
conclusion that the police should have tried to find and interview the caller
breaks down upon scrutiny.  There, the police were dealing with a known
declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming.  Here, the declarant was
unknown.  Apart from officer safety concerns, the likelihood of the police
finding the declarant would seem slim.  And the prospect of the declarant being
forthcoming and cooperative, if found, would seem even slimmer.  The necessity
criterion was thus met.

                    Although
it is perfectly consistent with the principled approach that even a single drug
purchase call may meet the threshold test for reliability, the Crown failed in
this case to establish that the call meets the test justifying its admission as
substantive evidence that B was engaged in drug trafficking.  Even if the
caller was entirely sincere in his belief that B was a drug dealer, that does
not address why the caller believed what he believed — and whether his belief
was in fact true or not.  This is not a case of multiple calls, where common
sense tells us that the probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is
unlikely.  Nor do we have sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the
statement or in the form of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.  Had
the circumstances been somewhat different, there may well have been a
satisfactory basis for evaluating whether the caller believed B was a drug
dealer and whether that belief was in fact true.  That is what threshold
reliability requires.

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell,
Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[1]                             
An out-of-court statement by a person not called
as a witness in the proceedings is properly characterized as hearsay where it
is tendered in evidence to make proof of the truth of its contents.

[2]                             
It is undisputed on this appeal that hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible as a matter of law.

[3]                             
The sole issue is whether this exclusionary rule
applies to “express hearsay” only, or to “implied hearsay” as well.  As a
matter of logic and of principle, I am satisfied that it does.  

[4]                             
In both instances, the relevance of the
out-of-court statement is not that the statement was made, but rather what
the content of the statement purports to prove.  And, in both instances,
what the statement purports to prove is the truth of what the person not called
as a witness is alleged to have asserted ― expressly or by implication.  

[5]                             
With respect to their logical relevance, there
is thus no substantive distinction between express and implied hearsay.  The
principled reasons for their presumptive inadmissibility apply equally to both.

[6]                             
For these reasons and the reasons that follow, I
agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the impugned out-of-court
statement in issue here ought to have been excluded by the trial judge.  It
falls within no traditional exception to the hearsay rule and lacks the indicia
of necessity and reliability that might otherwise render it admissible.

[7]                             
Accordingly, I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal
to this Court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

II

[8]                             
The respondent was convicted at his trial before
judge alone of possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purposes of
trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2)  of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
S.C. 1996, c. 19 .  

[9]                             
His appeal was allowed by a majority of the
Ontario Court of Appeal and a new trial ordered.  The Crown appeals to this
Court as of right, pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , on the questions of law on which the dissent of Watt J.A.
was based.

[10]                         
Since I agree with the Court of Appeal that a
new trial is warranted, I shall refer to the facts only to the extent necessary
to dispose of this appeal.

[11]                         
On May 11, 2006, Cornwall police officers
Sergeant Shawn Martelle and Constable Robert Ouellette responded to a suspected
break-in at the apartment of a certain Eric Lepage.  They knocked on the door
and a man, who identified himself as Chris Baldree, allowed them in.  The
officers entered and immediately detected an odour of marijuana, and discovered
marijuana “joints” and small marijuana buds in an ashtray.

[12]                         
In the closet of the spare bedroom, Sgt.
Martelle found an open safe containing a sandwich bag filled with 90 grams of
cocaine ― and, beside the safe, a large cardboard box with one ziplock
bag containing 511 grams of marijuana.

[13]                         
Mr. Baldree was arrested along with three other
people found in the apartment.  The police seized from him a cellular telephone
and some cash found in his possession.

[14]                         
At the police station, Mr. Baldree’s phone was
ringing.  Sgt. Martelle answered.  At trial, he described the call as follows:

A.  A
male voice on the other end of the, of the phone advised that he was at 327 Guy
Street and that he was a friend of Megan and asked for Chris.  Knowing that there
were two Chris that I had just arrested, I asked, “Chris who?” the male
advised, “Baldree” and requested one ounce of weed.  I then stated that I was
now running the, the show here and that Mr. Baldree was not here and I was
gonna take his . . . .

 

THE
COURT: All right, sorry, asked for Chris.

 

A.  Yes,
I’m sorry Your Honour.

 

THE
COURT: Yes.

 

A.  And
I questioned him, I asked him, “Chris who?” and he answered, “Baldree”.

 

THE
COURT: Yes.

 

A.  He
asked for one ounce of weed.  I then asked him how much Chris charges him, he
says he pays $150.  I then advised him I would deliver same, 327 Guy, and that
was the end of the conversation. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 76]

The police made no effort
at all to contact the caller at the address he provided.

[15]                         
Counsel for the accused promptly objected to
this testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay.  The trial judge
disagreed.  He found the evidence to be “non-hearsay”, a convenient term I
shall adopt throughout, on the basis of R. v. Ly, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698,
and R. v. Edwards (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d on other
grounds, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128.  

[16]                         
In the judge’s view:

Whether these calls can be referred to
as admissible hearsay or simply statements of state of mind, the law holds that
they are admissible as circumstantial evidence to indicate a person engaged in
drug trafficking.  They are not tendered in evidence for the truth of the fact
that the individual phoning is in fact the individual whom the individual
states to be or that the individual in fact will carry out the trafficking of
the drugs.  As stated, it is circumstantial evidence of an individual engaged
in the trafficking of drugs. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 22-23]

[17]                         
Having concluded that Sgt. Martelle’s testimony
was not hearsay, the trial judge found it unnecessary to weigh its probative
value against its prejudicial effect.

III

[18]                         
All three justices in the Ontario Court of
Appeal wrote separate reasons.  Feldman and Blair JJ.A. allowed the appeal and
ordered a new trial; Watt J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.

[19]                         
Feldman J.A. disagreed with the trial judge’s
characterization of the phone call as circumstantial evidence indicating that
Mr. Baldree was engaged in drug trafficking.  On the contrary, in her view,
“admitting the contents of [the] call into evidence is admitting that evidence
for a hearsay purpose.  It is the implied assertion of the caller, untested by
cross-examination, that the accused is a drug dealer” (para. 140).  

[20]                         
Feldman J.A. found that the trial judge thus
erred by focusing “on the truth of whether the caller really wanted to purchase
drugs, which was of course irrelevant, and not on the implied assertion in the
request” (para. 144).

[21]                         
Citing the reasons of the majority of the House
of Lords in R. v. Kearley, [1992] 2 All E.R. 345, and the opinion of
McMurtry C.J.O. in R. v. Wilson (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), Feldman
J.A. concluded that the hearsay analysis should not hinge on whether the
assertion is express or implied (para. 140).

[22]                         
She found that the telephone call was hearsay
and should not have been admitted as evidence against Mr. Baldree because it
could not withstand scrutiny under the principled approach to the hearsay
rule.  Regarding necessity, the police had the caller’s address, yet made no
effort to contact him; as to reliability, there was simply no basis to test the
caller’s belief without subjecting him to cross-examination (para. 146).  

[23]                         
Feldman J.A. also concluded that the evidence
was inadmissible because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial
effect (para. 147).

[24]                         
Feldman J.A. declined to apply the curative
proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  and
therefore held that the trial judge’s error required a new trial.  Particularly
in light of Crown counsel’s characterization of the drug purchase call as the
strongest piece of evidence against the accused, Feldman J.A. could not
conclude that the improper admission of Sgt. Martelle’s testimony had no effect
on the verdict (para. 149).

[25]                         
In separate but concurring reasons, Blair J.A.
was uncertain whether the impugned evidence constituted hearsay.   In any
event, he considered it preferable “for jurists to spend less time focusing on
the characterization of evidence into ‘hearsay’ or ‘non-hearsay’ categories in
these types of close-call scenarios and to spend more effort focusing on the
principled criteria of necessity/reliability and prejudice vs. probative value”
(para. 155).

[26]                         
Accordingly, Blair J.A. found it unnecessary to
“cut the ‘hearsay’ Gordian knot to resolve this appeal” because the impugned
evidence failed on both an assessment of its necessity and reliability and on
weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect (para. 156).

[27]                         
In his dissenting reasons, Watt J.A. agreed with
the trial judge that this Court’s decision in Ly held that evidence of a
single drug purchase call is admissible as non-hearsay (para. 73).

[28]                         
According to Watt J.A., a principled analysis
was unnecessary on these facts because the impugned evidence was not hearsay. 
He disagreed with his colleagues that the evidence should have been excluded on
the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value (paras.
95-98).

[29]                         
In the alternative, Watt J.A. was of the view
that even if the drug purchase call was improperly admitted at trial, the
conviction should nevertheless stand pursuant to the curative proviso (para.
99).

IV

[30]                         
The defining features of hearsay are (1) the
fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth of its contents and (2)
the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to cross-examine the declarant:  R.
v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 56.  As Justice
Charron explained in Khelawon, at para. 35, the hearsay rule
reflects the value our criminal justice system places on live, in-court testimony:

Our adversary system puts a premium on
the calling of witnesses, who testify under oath or solemn affirmation, whose
demeanour can be observed by the trier of fact, and whose testimony can be
tested by cross-examination.  We regard this process as the optimal way of
testing testimonial evidence.  Because hearsay evidence comes in a different
form, it raises particular concerns.  The general exclusionary rule is a
recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if
any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or
heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination.  The fear
is that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it
deserves.  

[31]                         
In short, hearsay evidence is presumptively
inadmissible because of the difficulties inherent in testing the reliability of
the declarant’s assertion.  Apart from the inability of the trier of fact to
assess the declarant’s demeanour in making the assertion, courts and commentators
have identified four specific concerns.  They relate to the declarant’s
perception, memory, narration, and sincerity: Khelawon, at para. 2; R.
v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 159.  

[32]                         
First, the declarant may have misperceived
the facts to which the hearsay statement relates; second, even if correctly
perceived, the relevant facts may have been wrongly remembered; third,
the declarant may have narrated the relevant facts in an unintentionally
misleading manner; and finally, the declarant may have knowingly
made a false assertion.  The opportunity to fully probe these potential
sources of error arises only if the declarant is present in court and subject
to cross-examination.

[33]                         
Over the years, a number of common law
exceptions were recognized, based on the belief that an overly rigid
application of the exclusionary rule would impede the truth-finding process. 
As J. H. Wigmore explains:

The theory of the Hearsay rule
. . . is that the many possible sources of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness
which may lie underneath the bare untested assertion of a witness can best be
brought to light and exposed, if they exist, by the test of cross-examination. 
But this test or security may in a given instance be superfluous; it may be
sufficiently clear, in that instance, that the statement offered is free from
the risk of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness, so that the test of
cross-examination would be a work of supererogation.  Moreover, the test may be
impossible of employment — for example, by reason of the death of the declarant
—, so that, if his testimony is to be used at all, there is a necessity for
taking it in the untested shape.  

 

(Wigmore on
Evidence (2nd ed. 1923), vol. III, at §1420, quoted with approval in R.
v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at p. 929.) 

[34]                         
Beginning with R. v. Khan, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 531, the Court has moved away from a set of judicially created
exceptions to the hearsay rule, and instead mandated a purposive approach,
governed by a principled framework set out this way by McLachlin C.J. in R.
v. Mapara, 2005 SCC 23, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 15:

(a)   Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it falls
under an exception to the hearsay rule.  The traditional exceptions to the
hearsay rule remain presumptively in place.

 

(b)   A hearsay exception can be challenged to determine whether it
is supported by indicia of necessity and reliability, required by the
principled approach.  The exception can be modified as necessary to bring it
into compliance.

 

(c)   In “rare cases”, evidence falling within an existing exception
may be excluded because the indicia of necessity and reliability are lacking in
the particular circumstances of the case.

 

(d)   If hearsay evidence does not fall under a hearsay exception,
it may still be admitted if indicia of reliability and necessity are
established on a voir dire.

[35]                         
The hearsay rule, like many others, is easier to
state than to apply.  

[36]                         
No evidence is hearsay on its face.  As
mentioned at the outset, its admissibility depends on the purpose for which
it is sought to be admitted.  Evidence is hearsay — and presumptively
inadmissible — if it is tendered to make proof of the truth of its contents.

V

[37]                         
Plainly, in this case, the Crown adduced Sgt.
Martelle’s evidence as proof of the truth of its contents.  Since the declarant
was not called to testify, Sgt. Martelle’s testimony constituted hearsay and
was therefore presumptively inadmissible.  Accordingly, in my view, the trial
judge erred in failing to subject the evidence to a principled analysis.

[38]                         
Sergeant Martelle testified, it will be
recalled, that someone claiming to be a resident of 327 Guy Street called the
cell phone which Sgt. Martelle had seized from Chris Baldree, asked for Mr.
Baldree, and requested an ounce of marijuana for the price of $150.  

[39]                         
I agree with Feldman J.A. that the Crown did not
offer this testimony as circumstantial evidence that the respondent was engaged
in drug trafficking.  Rather, the Crown asked the trier of fact to conclude,
based on Sgt. Martelle’s testimony, that the unknown caller intended to
purchase marijuana from the respondent because he believed the respondent to
be a drug dealer.  The relevance of the statement thus hinges on the truth
of the declarant’s underlying belief.  Any inference that can be drawn from the
statement necessarily assumes its veracity.

[40]                         
Had the caller stated that he wanted to buy
drugs from Mr. Baldree because Mr. Baldree sells drugs, this
would have amounted to an express assertion that Mr. Baldree is a drug dealer. 
Thus framed, the caller’s assertion would doubtless have constituted hearsay.  

[41]                         
But the caller stated instead that he was
calling because he wished to purchase drugs from Mr. Baldree.  His
assertion that Mr. Baldree is a drug dealer was no less manifest in substance,
though implicit rather than explicit in form.  In the Crown’s submission,
implied assertions are not caught by the hearsay rule and the telephone
conversation was presumptively admissible for that reason.

[42]                         
In my view, the hearsay nature of this evidence
cannot be made to depend on how the declarant framed his request.  Such a
formalistic analysis disregards the purposive approach to the hearsay rule
adopted by this Court.  Indeed, “it seems absurd that anything should turn on
the grammatical form of the declarant’s assertions”:  L. Dufraimont, Annotation
to R. v. Baldree (2012), 92 C.R. (6th) 331, at p. 334.  

[43]                         
There is no principled or meaningful distinction
between (a) “I am calling Mr. Baldree because I want to purchase drugs from
him” and (b) “I am calling Mr. Baldree because he sells drugs”. In either form,
this out-of-court statement is being offered for an identical purpose:  to
prove the truth of the declarant’s assertion that Mr. Baldree sells drugs.  No
trier of fact would need to be a grammarian in order to understand the import
of this evidence. 

[44]                         
The need for a functional approach to implied
assertions is readily apparent, bearing in mind the core hearsay dangers of
perception, memory, narration, and sincerity.

[45]                         
It has been argued that the danger of lack of
sincerity is sometimes diminished for implied assertions.  This is because
“[i]f a declarant possesses no intention of asserting anything, it would seem
to follow that he also possesses no intention of misrepresenting anything”: P.
R. Rice, “Should Unintended Implications of Speech be Considered Nonhearsay?
The Assertive/Nonassertive Distinction Under Rule 801(a) of the Federal Rules
of Evidence” (1992), 65 Temp. L. Rev. 529, at p. 531.  

[46]                         
But the other hearsay dangers clearly remain
operative, and may in fact increase when an individual “states” something by
implication:

Looked at from the point of
view of the four hearsay dangers, there is a much reduced risk of lies if the
declarant did not intend to convey that which his statement is relied upon to
prove, particularly if he it [sic] was not his purpose to make a
representation of fact at all.  But the other hearsay dangers remain, that is,
the risk of misperception, false memory (unless the implied assertion concerns
the declarant’s own state of mind) and ambiguity.  Indeed the last danger may
be magnified.  When X says:  “Is Z in there?” does this imply that Z is not
with X and nothing more, or that Z is not with X and X wants Z, or Z is in
danger, or X wants to know where Z is?  The upshot is that in many situations
implied assertions depend for their value on the reliability of the declarant
just as much as express assertions. [Emphasis added.]

 

(H. M. Malek et al.,
eds., Phipson on Evidence (17th
ed. 2010), at p. 889)

Moreover, even
insincerity remains a concern with implied assertions:

         If the justification for the
assertive/nonassertive distinction is the absence of the insincerity problem,
and through that guarantee of sincerity a reduced level of perception, memory,
and ambiguity problems, this justification cannot be applied to implied
statements from speech.  Speech is a mechanism of communication; it is
virtually always used for the purpose of communicating something to someone. 
It is illogical to conclude that the question of sincerity is eliminated and
that the problem of unreliability is reduced for unintended implications of
speech if that speech might have been insincere in the first instance, relative
to the direct message intentionally communicated.  If potential insincerity is
injected into the utterance of words that form the basis for the implied
communication, the implication from the speech is as untrustworthy as the
utterance upon which it is based.  [Rice, at p. 534]

[47]                         
In short, “if the standard for comparing express
and implied assertions is the quantity of dangers each entails, they are
indistinguishable”: T. Finman,
“Implied Assertions as Hearsay: Some Criticisms of the Uniform Rules of
Evidence” (1962), 14 Stan. L. Rev. 682, at p.
689.  

[48]                         
Accordingly, there is no principled reason, in
determining their admissibility, to distinguish between express and implied
assertions adduced for the truth of their contents.  Both function in precisely
the same way.  And the benefits of cross-examining the declarant are not
appreciably different when dealing with one form of testimony than the other. 
If an out-of-court statement implicates the traditional hearsay dangers, it
constitutes hearsay and must be dealt with accordingly.

[49]                         
In the present matter, the trial judge and the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal both found that this Court had decided
otherwise in Ly.  With respect, I disagree.  

[50]                         
Ly concerned the
admissibility of a telephone conversation between a police officer who had
called a suspected “dial-a-dope” operation and the person who answered his
call.  The officer had called to arrange for the purchase and delivery of
drugs.  And the appellant, drugs in hand, later showed up at the agreed-upon
time and place — where he was promptly arrested and charged with possession of
drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 

[51]                         
The trial judge characterized as hearsay, and
excluded for that reason, evidence of the police officer’s conversation with
the person who had answered his call.  On an appeal by the Crown, the Alberta
Court of Appeal disagreed.  It found that the impugned conversation was
admissible as “part of the narrative”, since “[i]t was impossible to understand
the development of the later events without the evidence of the telephone
conversation which preceded them” ((1996), 193 A.R. 149, at para. 3). 

[52]                         
In brief oral reasons, this Court agreed with
the Court of Appeal that evidence of the conversation was improperly excluded
at trial.  The Court noted that the conversation was tendered to explain why
the appellant appeared at the designated time and place in possession of the
drugs — and not, as in the case that concerns us here, for the truth of its
contents:  Ly, at para. 3.  

[53]                         
I see nothing in Ly to suggest — let
alone decide — that an implied assertion tendered for the truth of its contents
stands on a different footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an
explicit assertion to the same effect.  Unlike Ly, that is the issue
here.

[54]                         
And the issue now comes before us for the first
time, though it has for at least half a century divided lower courts in several
provinces:  see, for example, R. v. Fialkow, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont.
C.A.); Edwards; Wilson; R. v. Lucia, 2010 ONCA 533 (CanLII);
R. v. Cook (1978), 10 B.C.L.R. 84 (C.A.); R. v. Nguyen, 2003 BCCA
556, 188 B.C.A.C. 218; R. v. Parchment, 2004 BCSC 1806 (CanLII); R.
v. Williams, 2009 BCCA 284, 273 B.C.A.C. 86; R. v. Graham, 2013 BCCA
75 (CanLII); R. v. Ramsum, 2003 ABQB 45, 329 A.R. 370.

VI

[55]                         
The highest courts of England and Wales, and
Australia, have likewise concluded that the hearsay rule governs implied
assertions, only to have these decisions reversed by statute: see Kearley;
R. v. Bannon (1995), 132 A.L.R. 87 (H.C.); Criminal Justice Act 2003
(U.K.), 2003, c. 44, s. 115; Evidence Act 1995 (Aust.), No. 2, s.
59(1).  

[56]                         
In Canada, Parliament has not found it necessary
or appropriate to adopt legislation classifying implied assertions as
non-hearsay.  This is, of course, entirely understandable in view of our
principled and more flexible approach to exclusion.

[57]                         
As noted by Feldman J.A., the facts in Kearley,
the leading British decision, were similar to the facts in this case.  In Kearley,
the police raided the home of the accused on suspicion that he was selling
drugs.  Drugs were found, but in insufficient quantities to support an
inference of drug trafficking.  While the police were present at the accused’s
residence, they intercepted ten telephone calls from callers asking to purchase
drugs from him.  Seven people also came to the apartment seeking to buy
narcotics.  

[58]                         
The majority of the House of Lords concluded
that the drug purchase calls and the in-person statements were inadmissible
hearsay.  Because they were phrased as requests for drugs, the statements did
not directly assert but instead implied that the accused was a drug dealer. 
However, whether stated expressly or impliedly, their Lordships found the
information communicated to be the same.  In Lord Ackner’s words:

                           .
. . if the inquirer had said in the course of making his request, “I would like
my usual supply of amphetamine at the price which I paid you last week” . . ., the
hearsay rule prevents the prosecution from calling police officers to recount
the conversation which I have described. . . . 

 

                           If
[however] the simple request or requests for drugs to be supplied by the appellant,
as recounted by the police, contains in substance, but only by implication, the
same assertion, then I can find neither authority nor principle to suggest that
the hearsay rule should not be equally applicable and exclude such evidence. 
What is sought to be done is to use the oral assertion, even though it may be
an implied assertion, as evidence of the truth of the proposition asserted. 
That the proposition is asserted by way of necessary implication rather than
expressly cannot, to my mind, make any difference. [pp. 363-64]

[59]                         
Two main reasons have been urged against
applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions.  

[60]                         
First, as Watt. J.A. states (at para. 83) and as
the Crown argues, excluding implied assertions as hearsay has the potential of
broadening the exclusionary rule, given that “[v]irtually every human action is
based on some set of assumptions implicitly accepted and, on this approach,
‘asserted’ by the actor” (A.F., at para. 62, quoting McWilliams’ Canadian
Criminal Evidence (4th ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 7-21).  

[61]                         
Second, as critics of Kearley have
pointed out, applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions such as drug
purchase calls has the potential to deprive the trier of fact of reliable
evidence and thereby impede the truth-finding process:  see, for example, D.
Birch, “Criminal Justice Act 2003 (4) Hearsay:  Same Old Story, Same Old
Song?”, [2004] Crim. L.R. 556, at pp. 564-65.

[62]                         
The short answer to the first argument is that
we are not concerned on this appeal with the application of the hearsay rule to
assertions implied through non-verbal conduct.  Our concern, rather, is with a
quintessentially verbal statement. 

[63]                         
The issue of the applicability of the hearsay
rule to inferences that can be drawn from non-verbal conduct is best left for
another day.  For present purposes, I find it sufficient to say that “one can
engage in conduct without ever intending to communicate anything to anyone
[but] the same is not true of speech or a combination of speech and conduct
(for example, placing a bet) because the sole purpose of speech is
communication”:  Rice, at p. 536 (emphasis in original).

[64]                         
The second concern mentioned above is greatly
attenuated, I again emphasize, by Canada’s principled approach to hearsay.  

[65]                         
In Kearley, having found the evidence in
that case to be hearsay, it was automatically excluded because it did not fall
within a traditional exception to the hearsay rule.  

[66]                         
The Canadian approach suffers from no such
inflexibility.  Under our law, hearsay evidence that is not admissible under a
traditional exception may nonetheless be admitted pursuant to a principled
analysis of its necessity and reliability.  This “sensible scheme” recognizes
that “some implied assertions, like some express assertions, will be highly
reliable even in the absence of cross-examination”:  Finman, at p. 693. 
Pursuant to its terms, implied assertions that are necessary and reliable may
be admitted while those that are unreliable or unnecessary will be excluded.

VII

[67]                         
On the facts of this case, no traditional exception
applies and the impugned evidence withers on a principled analysis.  It
satisfies neither the requirement of necessity nor the requirement of
reliability. 

[68]                         
In Khelawon, necessity was conceded. 
Justice Charron nonetheless took care to note that

in an appropriate case, the court in
deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of
the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the evidence of the
declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party. 
[para. 104]

This is the kind of “appropriate
case” contemplated by Khelawon.  And the answer is that the police made
no effort at all to secure the evidence of the declarant: they never sought
to interview or even find him, though he gave them his address. 
Moreover, there was no explanation offered as to why no efforts were made to
locate the declarant.

[69]                         
Nor is the single telephone call in this case
sufficiently reliable.  As Feldman J.A. found in the court below, “[t]here was
no basis to say that the caller’s belief was reliable without testing the basis
for that belief by cross-examination” (para. 146).  Indeed, this is not a
situation “in which it can be easily seen that such a required test [i.e.,
cross-examination] would add little as a security, because its purposes had
been already substantially accomplished”:  Khelawon, at para. 62,
quoting Wigmore on Evidence, at §1420. 

[70]                         
In concluding as I have, I take care not to be
understood to have proposed a categorical rule for drug purchase calls. 
Although the call at issue here does not withstand scrutiny under the
principled approach, this need not always be the case.  

[71]                         
For example, where the police intercept not one
but several drug purchase calls, the quantity of the calls might well suffice
in some circumstances to establish reliability — indeed, while “[o]ne or two
might [be] mistaken, or might even have conspired to frame the defendant as a
dealer”, it would “def[y] belief that all the callers had made the same error
or were all party to the same conspiracy”: I. H. Dennis, The Law of Evidence
(4th ed. 2010), at p. 708. 

[72]                         
Moreover, the number of callers could also
inform necessity.  The Crown cannot be expected, where there are numerous
declarants, to locate and convince most or all to testify at trial, even in the
unlikely event that they have supplied their addresses — as in this case.  And
it is important to remember that the criteria of necessity and reliability work
in tandem:  if the reliability of the evidence is sufficiently established, the
necessity requirement can be relaxed:  see Khelawon, at para. 86, citing
R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995]
3 S.C.R. 764.

[73]                         
Here, we are presented with a single drug
purchase call of uncertain reliability.  The caller gave his address.  No
effort was made to find and interview him, still less to call him as a witness
— where the assertion imputed to him could have been evaluated by the trier of
fact in the light of cross-examination and the benefit of observing his
demeanour. 

VIII

[74]                         
Manifestly, the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  can have no application in this case, since it
cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different had the impugned telephone call not been admitted:  R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617.  

[75]                         
Indeed, in summing up, Crown counsel described
the impugned telephone call as the strongest piece of evidence in the case
(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 127).  In counsel’s words, “the cell phone call placing
the order seals the story as far as I’m concerned” (p. 138).  Moreover, the
trial judge referred to the phone call in his reasons for judgment and took it
into account when assessing Mr. Baldree’s credibility (A.R., vol. I, at p.
29).  

[76]                         
In this light, it can hardly be stated that the
improper admission of this evidence could not have affected the result at trial.

IX

[77]                         
For all of these reasons, I would dismiss this
appeal, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, set aside the respondent’s
conviction, and order a new trial. 

                    The
following are the reasons delivered by

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.       Overview

[78]                         
I join my colleague Fish J. in rejecting this
drug purchase call under the principled approach to hearsay, and I agree in
the main with his opinion.  In particular, I agree that an implied assertion of
a factual proposition is part of the “contents” of a statement for purposes of
the hearsay rule.  Indeed, while the parties disagree, the intervener Attorney
General of Ontario advances that very view.  

[79]                         
I write separately, however, to underscore my
reservations with Part VII of my colleague’s reasons, which deal with the
criteria of necessity and reliability under the principled approach.  In
particular, I am concerned by my colleague’s approach to necessity.  That
criterion has its purpose, but we ought not to approach it as a box that must
invariably be checked off before drug purchase calls like this one can be
admitted.  In such cases, the real concern is reliability — and that, in my
respectful view, should be the focus of our inquiry.

[80]                         
The starting point is the recognition that we
are today characterizing as hearsay — and thus presumptively inadmissible —
evidence which has long been received by the courts as circumstantial
evidence.  It is not a step to be undertaken lightly.  Nonetheless, I believe
it is the right one.  As my colleague observes, the characterization of a particular
piece of evidence as hearsay should not hinge on the declarant’s particular
choice of words (paras. 42-43).  Rather, the focus should be on the existence
(or non-existence) of the hearsay dangers having regard to the purpose for
which the out-of-court statement is being tendered.

[81]                         
Thus, I agree that judges must satisfy
themselves of the reliability of drug purchase calls on a case-by-case basis. 
If the evidence is reliable, it should be admitted because its reception
will be necessary in order to get closer to the truth.  If it is not
reliable, the evidence should stay out.  The only difference between yesterday
and today should be that in characterizing implied assertions as hearsay, we
avoid the thorny debate about what the declarant did or did not intend to
assert and, instead, put the focus on what truly matters in cases such as this
one:  “. . . whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its
reception” (A. W. Bryant, S. N. Lederman and M. K. Fuerst, The Law
of Evidence in Canada (3rd ed. 2009), at p. 244).  

[82]                         
Here, for reasons I will explain, this call
cannot be said to be sufficiently reliable.  Accordingly, I agree that it
should have been excluded.

II.       Analysis

A.     The Concern Is Threshold Reliability

[83]                         
It is important to set the stage for the
following discussion by clarifying what is actually at issue.  Here, I am
speaking only of threshold reliability, not ultimate
reliability.  At this point, a court is concerned only with whether the call
exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact “a
satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement” (R. v. Hawkins,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para. 75).  Threshold reliability exists because of a
“fear . . . that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it
deserves” (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para.
35).

[84]                         
But once threshold reliability is established,
ultimate reliability — including what weight, if any, to attach to the evidence
— is a matter for the trier of fact.  As Charron J. observed in Khelawon, at para. 50:

Whether the hearsay statement will or
will not be ultimately relied upon in deciding the issues in the case is a
matter for the trier of fact to determine at the conclusion of the trial based
on a consideration of the statement in the context of the entirety of the
evidence.

B.     The Historical Treatment of Drug Purchase Calls

[85]                         
As Watt J.A. observed in his dissenting reasons
at the Court of Appeal, the question about drug purchase calls — in particular,
whether they may contain an implied assertion — “has played little or no role”
in the jurisprudence to date (2012 ONCA 138, 109 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 53). 
Nonetheless, as my colleague Fish J. points out, a long line of cases have
admitted evidence similar to the evidence under consideration here on the basis
that it was non-hearsay (para. 54).  See, e.g., R. v. Owad (1951), 102
C.C.C. 155 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Fialkow, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Cook (1978), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Edwards (1994),
19 O.R. (3d) 239 (C.A.); R. v. Nguyen, 2003 BCCA 556, 188 B.C.A.C. 218; R.
v. Williams, 2009 BCCA 284, 273 B.C.A.C. 86; R. v. Lucia, 2010 ONCA
533 (CanLII); R. v. Graham, 2013 BCCA 75 (CanLII).  

[86]                         
These decisions give me pause.  Can we have been
wrong for so long?

[87]                         
Because I think it safe to conclude that judges
are not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, I am led to
believe that these earlier cases rest on the conclusion — often unstated, but
sometimes explicit — that drug purchase calls are inherently reliable.  It may
be that these decisions reflect an implicit judicial consensus, emerging from
multiple decisions over multiple decades, that because such evidence is
reliable more often than not, it can safely be categorized as non-hearsay. 
Feldman J.A. made a similar point in her reasons (para. 131).

[88]                         
The case of Edwards offers a helpful
example of an explicit conclusion as to the reliability of these calls.  In
that case, the issue was whether “a number of calls [to the accused’s phone]
from people ordering small amounts of crack cocaine” were admissible to prove
the accused was a drug dealer (p. 243).  Although McKinlay J.A. concluded that
the evidence was not being introduced to prove the truth of its contents and
thus was not hearsay, in the alternative, she held that the evidence was
admissible under the principled approach:

In my view, the evidence in issue
fulfils these criteria. It was necessary to prove the nature of the appellant’s
drug activities, and they could not have been proven in this case in any other
way that was available to the police. They did not know the identity of the
callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have testified if
their identity had been known. The evidence is reliable, because it was made
under circumstances which negate the possibility that the requests were
spurious ones. The callers were led to believe that the persons to whom they
were speaking (the police) were speaking on behalf of the appellant.
[Emphasis added; p. 249.]

[89]                         
To the extent the other cases reflect McKinlay
J.A.’s view about the reliability of such calls, they align with explicit
conclusions to the same effect made by regulation or statute in other
jurisdictions.  See, e.g., Federal Rules of Evidence (U.S.), Rule 801; Criminal
Justice Act 2003 (U.K.), 2003, c. 44, s. 115.  As one leading treatise on
the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence observed in explaining the Rules’
blanket exclusion of implied assertions from the definition of hearsay:

. . . when a person acts in a
way consistent with a belief but without intending by his act to communicate
that belief, one of the principal reasons for the hearsay rule — to
exclude declarations whose veracity cannot be tested by cross-examination —
does not apply, because the declarant’s sincerity is not then involved.
[Emphasis added.]

 

(J. B.
Weinstein and M. A. Berger, Weinstein’s Evidence: Commentary on Rules of
Evidence for the United States Courts and for State Courts (loose-leaf),
vol. 4, at § 801(a)(01))

See also McCormick on
Evidence (7th ed. 2013), vol. 2 (arguing the Rule 801 definition is “a
compromise between theory and the need for a relatively simple and workable
definition in situations where hearsay dangers are generally reduced”, at pp.
208-9); I. H. Dennis, The Law of Evidence (4th ed. 2010) (arguing that
because “hearsay dangers are often significantly reduced in cases of implied
assertions, there is no compelling systemic reason for applying the hearsay
rule to them”, at p. 710).

[90]                         
Indeed, the Law Reform Commission of Canada’s
proposed Evidence Code of 1975 proceeded on the same basis.  Its
definition of hearsay thus excluded implied assertions, whether verbal or
non-verbal.  See Evidence Code, s. 27(2)(b) in Report on
Evidence (1975).  The commissioners — including Antonio Lamer, who would go
on to become a principal architect of the principled approach to hearsay —
concluded:

Under the definition, . . . a person’s
words or conduct are not hearsay if he did not intend them to be assertive. In
assessing the reliability of such evidence account may have to be taken of the
dangers of hearsay evidence. . . . [U]nlike conscious assertions, a person
is seldom likely to be deliberately misleading when he engaged in non-assertive
activity, which is the most important danger associated with hearsay. In
defining hearsay to exclude non-assertive conduct the Code follows the better
view of the present law. [Emphasis added; p. 69.]

[91]                         
The above reasoning, however, suffers from one
important drawback.  That is because when we speak about hearsay in a case such
as this one, a distinction must be drawn between the fact that something
is true and the declarant’s belief that it is true.  As Professor
McCormick observed:

It is only where the statement
is offered as the basis for the inferences, first, that the declarant believed
it, and, second, that the facts were in accordance with his belief, that the
evidence is hearsay. [Emphasis in original.]

 

(C. T.
McCormick, “The Borderland of Hearsay” (1930), 39 Yale L.J. 489, at p. 490)

[92]                         
Our concerns with respect to the reliability of
the hearsay statement are thus two-fold.  First, there is the concern that the
declarant may not believe what she is saying and thus may be consciously
lying (the sincerity hearsay danger).  Second, even though she may believe what
she says, she may be mistaken about the facts of what she is saying (the
perception, memory, and narration dangers).  As some scholars have observed, it
is this second concern that has at times been overlooked.  See, e.g., S.
Schiff, “Evidence — Hearsay and the Hearsay Rule: A Functional View” (1978), 56
Can. Bar Rev. 674, at p. 683, fn. 33 (criticizing the Evidence Code
definition for “ignor[ing] every reason for the hearsay rule except the danger
that the declarant may have been insincere”). 

[93]                         
It seems to me that this second ground of
concern is what led to the decision in R. v. Wilson (1996), 29 O.R. (3d)
97 (C.A.).  In that case, the Crown sought to tender evidence that while the
police were at the accused’s home, “a man came to the door asking for ‘Rob’ and
seeking to buy drugs” (p. 104).  The accused’s name was Robert Wilson.  The
trial judge admitted the evidence on the strength of Edwards, but the
Court of Appeal reversed.  McMurtry C.J.O. reasoned that it was “dangerous” and
“unsafe” to draw an inference that the accused was a drug dealer from a single
visit (pp. 104-5).  

[94]                         
Significantly, however, McMurtry C.J.O. was
untroubled by the result in Edwards.  In his view, the evidence of “ten
separate calls” in that case permitted an “irresistible inference” about
the nature of that accused’s activities (p. 104).  Thus, while it is possible
that one individual could be mistaken in believing that the person he called (or
called on) was a drug dealer, one would be hard-pressed to conclude that ten
such people could all be mistaken.  See D. M. Paciocco and L.
Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (6th ed. 2011), at pp. 111-12; Dennis, at
pp. 707-9.

[95]                         
In other words, the distinction between Edwards
and Wilson is that the evidence in one case was judged to be reliable
and the evidence in the other was not.  It was that assessment that dictated
the answer with respect to admissibility — and that, as I see it, is the
assessment we should be focusing on.

C.        What Is the Role of
Necessity?

[96]                         
I turn then to the question of necessity.  It bears recalling
that “the central reason for the presumptive exclusion
of hearsay statements is the general inability to test their reliability” (Khelawon,
at para. 2 (emphasis added)).  That, of course, is not to suggest that we have
ousted necessity as a prerequisite to the admission of hearsay evidence.  We
have not.  But what we have said is that “necessity and reliability should not
be considered in isolation” because “[o]ne criterion may have an impact on the
other” (para. 77).  Indeed, we have recognized that “[i]n the interest of
seeking the truth, the very high reliability of [a] statement [can render]
its substantive admission necessary” (para. 86 (emphasis added), citing R.
v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and R. v. U. (F.J.),
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 764).  That is the principle I would apply here.

[97]                         
My colleague, however, sees a broader role for
necessity in cases such as this one.  He quotes Charron J. in Khelawon,
at para. 104, for the proposition that “in an appropriate case, the
court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the
proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the
evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the
other party” (emphasis added).  On that basis, he concludes, at para. 68:

This is the kind of “appropriate
case” contemplated by Khelawon.  And the
answer is that the police made no effort at all to secure the evidence
of the declarant: they never sought to interview or even find him, though he
gave them his address.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]

[98]                         
With respect, I am not at all sure that this is
the kind of “appropriate case” Charron J. had in mind when she said what she
said in Khelawon.

[99]                         
The declarant in Khelawon was a frail
81-year-old who was living in a retirement home after having suffered a
stroke.  He died before trial and thus could not be called to testify, but the
Crown sought to introduce, under the principled approach, an unsworn videotaped
statement he made to the police during the course of their investigation.  It
was in that context that Charron J. observed, at para. 104:

Although Mr. Skupien was elderly and
frail at the time he made the allegations, there is no evidence that the Crown
attempted to preserve his evidence by application under ss. 709  to 714  of the Criminal
Code . He did not testify at the preliminary
hearing. The record does not disclose if he had died by that time. In making
these comments, I do not question the fact that it was necessary for the Crown
to resort to Mr. Skupien’s evidence in hearsay form. Necessity is conceded. However,
in an appropriate case, the court in deciding the question of necessity may
well question whether the proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts
to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the
rights of the other party. That issue is not raised here. [Emphasis added.]

[100]                     
It seems to me that Charron J. was making the
point that even though the police should reasonably have anticipated that the
declarant might not be able to attend the trial — “Mr. Skupien was elderly and
frail” — they did nothing to secure his evidence in a better form even though
they knew he was likely to be cooperative and forthcoming.  As Charron J.
noted, ss. 709  to 714  of the Criminal Code  “expressly contemplate
this eventuality and provide a procedure for the taking of the evidence
before a commissioner in the presence of the accused or his counsel thereby
preserving both the evidence and the rights of the accused” (para. 7 (emphasis
added)).

[101]                     
The facts in Khelawon are thus a far cry
from the facts in the case at hand — and because of that, care should be taken
before we start accepting that a perfectly reasonable request of the police in
one set of circumstances will necessarily translate into an equally reasonable
request in other circumstances.

[102]                     
And that, in my respectful view, is where the
analogy to Khelawon breaks down.  In Khelawon, the police were
dealing with a known declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming. 
Here, the declarant was unknown and even if the police had been able to find
him — a big “if” — there is no reason to believe that he would have been
forthcoming and cooperative.  Indeed, the opposite is more likely to be true.  

[103]                     
With that in mind, it bears recalling that, as
Charron J. herself observed shortly after Khelawon, the test for
necessity is not whether the hearsay statement is the best form of the evidence
(for that will always be live testimony), but whether it is the “best available
form” in the circumstances (R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R.
517, at para. 79 (emphasis added)).

[104]                     
The question that arises then is:  Should we be
requiring the police, in the name of necessity, to track down unknown and often
unknowable declarants, who are unlikely to be found and unlikely to be
forthcoming and cooperative in the event they are found?

[105]                     
The answer, I believe, is found in Edwards,
where McKinlay J.A. observed:

[The police] did not know the identity
of the callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have
testified if their identity had been known. [p. 249]

In my respectful view,
McKinlay J.A.’s logic remains sound, even on the facts here.

[106]                     
Although it is true the police in this case had
the benefit of the caller’s address, the caller’s identity was still unknown. 
Surely, the police were not going to show up at 327 Guy St. and ask who there
was looking to buy drugs from Chris Baldree.  Apart from officer safety
concerns, the likelihood of the police finding the declarant would seem slim. 
And the prospect of the declarant being forthcoming and cooperative, if found,
would seem even slimmer.  An undercover drug buy would be even more
problematic, given the number of officers who would be needed to see it through
and the obvious risks to the officer safety inherent in such an operation.  

[107]                     
Under either option, the game would hardly be
worth the candle.  And that, in my view, provides a full answer to the concern
that the police offered no explanation as to why they made no efforts to locate
the declarant.  With respect, no explanation was necessary — common sense
provides one.  If there is little chance of finding the declarant, and little
chance that, if found, he or she will be forthcoming and provide the police
with evidence in a better form than the call itself (such as a B. (K.G.)
statement or testimony in court), the necessity criterion will have been met.

[108]                     
Equally problematic is the suggestion by my
colleague that even where there are multiple callers, the police could
be expected to go out and seek to persuade at least some of them to
testify (para. 72).  With respect, absent evidence of collusion, I see that as
being wasteful.  It amounts to little more than tipping our hat to necessity
for necessity’s sake.  That has not been, and should not be, what the test for
necessity requires.

[109]                     
At bottom, the point is that the necessity
criterion is not meant to stifle the admission of reliable evidence.  Rather,
it is “founded on society’s interest in getting at the truth” (Khelawon,
at para. 49).  Necessity should be viewed as a servant of the truth, not its
master.  For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the prospect of
locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a forthcoming
and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it should be
admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in order to get
closer to the truth.  If the evidence is not reliable, it should be excluded. 
Either way, in my view, the focus should be reliability.

D.     Was This Call Reliable?

[110]                     
The reliability of a particular hearsay
statement can be tested by looking at, among other things, the circumstances in
which the statement came about.  One may look for indicia of reliability within
the four corners of the statement.  The law also provides that indicia of
reliability may be found outside the statement in the form of confirmatory
evidence (Khelawon, at para. 100).

[111]                     
The Crown maintains that this call was
sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception.  In particular, the Crown
relies on the absence of any evidence that “the caller was motivated by
anything other than a desire to purchase drugs” and the argument that the
“spontaneity of the conversation was made under circumstances where an
intentional lie was remote” (A.F., at para. 82).  

[112]                     
This argument has something to it.  As I
indicated above, there is good reason to believe that the sincerity hearsay
danger is reduced in cases such as this one.  That said, Mr. Baldree argues
that the circumstances in which this call came about are sufficient to warrant
concern that this call may have been “made to throw suspicion” on him (R.F., at
para. 85).  

[113]                     
As the record reveals, there was initially some
uncertainty about the respective roles of Mr. Baldree and the other Chris in
this case, Christopher Anderson, as to the drugs found in the apartment.  Sgt.
Martelle testified that Mr. Anderson was known to be “deal[ing] in . . . those
types of drugs” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 106).  He was apparently a man of some
repute, known “on the streets” as “the Mexican” (p. 59).

[114]                     
On its own, Mr. Baldree’s argument is
insufficient to impugn the reliability of this call.  He has not suggested, for
example, how Mr. Anderson or anyone else could have arranged for a fabricated
call when the police seized all cell phones at the time of the arrests and no
persons were released by the police until after the call was received. 
Had either of Mr. Anderson’s two associates been released by the police before
the call was received on Mr. Baldree’s phone, it would have been a
different matter.  But those are not our facts.

[115]                     
I caution thus against inferring suspicious
circumstances in these types of cases absent any evidence suggesting as much. 
If that were our approach, many of our time-tested hearsay exceptions would
unravel.  To state the obvious, a dying man does not lose his ability to lie. 
And yet, in the case of dying declarations, we do not indulge in speculation
about potential fabrication.  Instead, the law recognizes that a motive to lie
in such circumstances is at best remote (R. v. Woodcock (1789), 1 Leach
500, 168 E.R. 352 (K.B.), at p. 353).  In other words, we recognize a norm of
human behaviour for what it is — a norm.

[116]                     
In sum, because our rules are not designed
around theoretical possibilities but practical realities, a drug purchase call
by mere dint of being a drug purchase call should not raise suspicions of
fabrication.  While the onus remains on the proponent of the evidence to
establish that the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception,
I would suggest that “it falls to the person opposing the evidence to show
circumstances of suspicion” (R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
144, at para. 8, per McLachlin C.J.).  Here, the record does not reveal
a sufficient basis to worry about the circumstances in which the call to Mr.
Baldree’s phone came about.

[117]                     
Examining the sincerity of this caller’s belief,
however, does not end the matter — and ultimately this is where the Crown’s
argument in this case falls short.  

[118]                     
Here, the Crown sought to introduce the drug
purchase call to establish not merely that the caller believed that Mr.
Baldree was a drug trafficker (evidence of limited value to the Crown’s case),
but that Mr. Baldree was in fact a drug trafficker (evidence of
significant value).  Indeed, though he characterized it as circumstantial
evidence, the trial judge here correctly recognized that the evidence was being
used to establish that Mr. Baldree was “engaged in the trafficking of
drugs” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 23 (emphasis added)).  It was on the basis of that
fact that the Crown sought an inference that Mr. Baldree was in possession
of the cocaine and marijuana found in the apartment.

[119]                     
The problem with the Crown’s argument is that it
says little about the reliability of the assertion that Mr. Baldree is in fact
a drug trafficker.  The argument is more successful with respect to the fact
that the caller intended to purchase drugs.  Accordingly, the
statement would have been admissible as a statement of present intention if the
Crown had sought to introduce it for that purpose (see, e.g., R.
v. Ly, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698).  But, as Feldman J.A. observed, that is not
why the Crown sought to introduce this evidence (para. 144).

[120]                     
Put another way, the problem with the Crown’s
argument is that even if the caller was entirely sincere in his belief that Mr.
Baldree was a drug dealer, that does not address why the caller believed
what he believed — and whether his belief was in fact true or not. 
This is not a case of multiple calls, where common sense tells us that the
probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is unlikely.  Nor do we have
sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the statement or in the form
of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.

[121]                     
Accordingly, and absent more, it thus seems to
me a bridge too far to accept the Crown’s argument that this call meets
threshold reliability thereby justifying its admission as substantive evidence
that Mr. Baldree was engaged in drug trafficking.

E.      Can a Single Call Ever Be Reliable?

[122]                     
Just because the single call here did not meet
the threshold test for admissibility, it does not follow that multiple calls
are required to establish as much.  Indeed, it is perfectly consistent
with the principled approach that even a single drug purchase call may
meet that threshold.  I will attempt to explain why using the facts of this
call as an example.

[123]                     
As I mentioned earlier, what is missing in this
call is some assurance that Mr. Baldree was in fact a drug dealer. 
There are insufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness within the
call itself and little or no external confirmatory evidence.  However, if the
caller had declined the offer of delivery and instead asked “if I can drop by
Eric’s apartment to pick up the drugs”, that may have been sufficient because
it would have indicated greater familiarity with Mr. Baldree and his
activities, including contemporary knowledge of his recent move to Mr. Lepage’s
apartment.  A debt list at Mr. Lepage’s apartment with Mr. Baldree’s
fingerprints on it may also have done the trick because it would have served as
confirmatory evidence of Mr. Baldree’s involvement in drug trafficking.  One
can imagine other scenarios.

[124]                     
My point is simply that had the circumstances
been somewhat different, there may well have been a satisfactory basis for
evaluating whether the caller believed Mr. Baldree was a drug dealer and
whether that belief was in fact true.  That is what threshold
reliability requires.  Setting aside the facts of this case, we do not know
what the circumstances of some future call might be.  I would thus caution against
the notion that only multiple calls can be reliable.

III.    Conclusion

[125]                     
Subject to these comments, I join the reasons of

	BASTEN JA: In circumstances fully explained by R A Hulme J, the applicant, Richard Wright, sought leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Woodburne DCJ for a number of sexual assaults on young children. Although the circumstances require careful consideration, the material presented to the Court does not ultimately qualify as material upon which this Court could intervene. Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal against the sentences.
	
	
	The admissibility in this Court, on an application for leave to appeal against sentence, of evidence not before the sentencing judge has been the subject of recent consideration in the High Court, restating principles which have, broadly speaking, been applied by this Court for several decades. It is convenient to restate those principles, so far as relevant for present purposes, in order to demonstrate that no occasion for intervention has been established.
	
	
	An application for leave to appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is to be determined in accordance with s 6(3) of that Act. The first step is to identify error on the part of the sentencing judge. As explained in Kentwell v The Queen, [1]  in terms derived from House v The King: [2] 
	


“When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. … This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.”


	
	The joint judgment in Kentwell continued, “[a]fter having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.” [3]  This last proposition was very recently reiterated in Betts v The Queen: [4] 
	


“As a general rule, the appellate court's assessment of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is made on the material before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of the offender's progress towards rehabilitation in the period since the sentence hearing. For the purposes of that assessment, an offender is not permitted to run a new and different case. This general rule does not deny that an appellate court has the flexibility to receive new evidence where it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. In this appeal, the general rule applied because the new evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant was inconsistent with the case that he ran in the sentencing court and its rejection in the circumstances did not cause justice to miscarry.”


	
	Although Betts was concerned with evidence relevant to the second stage of the process (error having been established warranting intervention by this Court), the joint reasons commenced with a statement of the principles relevant to the determination of appeals generally under s 6(3). The Court said: [5] 
	


“Notwithstanding its wide terms, it is well settled that the Court of Criminal Appeal's power to intervene is not enlivened unless error in any of the ways explained in House v The King is established. [6]  The identification of error will ordinarily be by reference to the sentencing judge's reasons on the material that was before the court. However, the Court of Criminal Appeal has recognised that there are bases upon which error at first instance may be disclosed by new or fresh evidence. [7]  Generally, the Court of Criminal Appeal insists upon proper grounds being established as a foundation for the exercise of its discretion to receive fresh evidence. [8]  Evidence qualifies as fresh evidence if it could not have been obtained at the time of the sentence hearing by the exercise of reasonable diligence. [9]  None of this is to deny that the Court of Criminal Appeal has the flexibility to receive new evidence where it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. [10] ”


	
	This statement of principle is important in the present case, because the evidence sought to be relied upon to establish a ground of intervention was not evidence before the sentencing judge, nor was any error independently identified in the judgment on sentence. Unlike Betts, the focus in the present case was on the first stage (identifying error) rather than the second stage (resentencing).
	
	
	The statement of principle in Betts raises two issues of present importance. The first is whether the phrase “new or fresh evidence” was intended to refer to “new and fresh” evidence and, secondly, whether the caselaw approved in the last sentence, referring to “the flexibility to receive new evidence” was not limited to evidence properly described as fresh evidence.
	
	
	The concept of “fresh evidence” is generally understood as evidence that is new, in the sense that it had not been obtained at the time of the hearing at first instance, and was “fresh” in the sense that it could not have been obtained at that time in the exercise of reasonable diligence. The element of ambiguity is revealed by the reference to R v Lanham, a decision of this Court constituted by Mason and Manning JJA and Isaacs J. The passage in the judgment referred to in Betts read as follows: [11] 
	


“Before dealing with the substance of the appeal it is necessary to deal with an application made by senior counsel for the applicant that this Court should receive certain affidavit evidence which was not tendered to the learned Chairman of Quarter Sessions. The Court has, of course, a discretion to admit fresh evidence but that discretion is to be exercised in accordance with well-settled principles which need no reiteration here. … It is necessary that we should state clearly and unequivocally that it is not the customary practice of the Court to receive fresh evidence and that in every case proper grounds must be established as a foundation for the exercise of the Court’s discretion to admit fresh evidence. Indeed, if the Court were to take any other view, it would be lending its encouragement to a situation in which evidence relevant to the issue of penalty might be withheld from a lower court to be used on appeal in the event that the penalty imposed was thought to be too severe.”


	
	The last sentence (envisaging withholding of evidence) suggests that the term “fresh evidence” was not being used in a restricted and technical sense.
	
	
	In R v Vachalec, also referred to in Betts in the passage set out above, Street CJ (delivering the judgment of a court comprising himself, Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J) stated, by reference to both appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, that the primary function of the Court was to ascertain whether the decision was in error. The reasons continued: [12] 
	


“Normally error requires the evaluation of the material placed before the first instance court. There are, however, well-established bases upon which error in the first instance proceedings can be disclosed by fresh or new evidence. In addition the Court’s jurisdiction is exercisable where it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	Referring to the judgment of James J (with whom Mason P and Hislop J agreed) in R v Deng [13]  the High Court noted that this Court will routinely receive “evidence of the offender’s progress towards rehabilitation in the period since the sentence hearing” on the limited basis that it may be taken into account at the second stage (resentencing). [14]  However, even at the second stage, in circumstances where the power of the court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion had been enlivened, the High Court rejected the proposition that other evidence, not before the sentencing judge, should be admitted. Thus the Court stated: [15] 
	


“Forensic choices are made in the conduct of the offender's case at the sentence hearing. These include the material that is to be relied upon in mitigation of penalty and whether any of the facts are to be contested. The circumstance that the sentencing judge's discretion is vitiated by House error does not, without more, provide a reason for not holding the offender to these forensic choices. Justice does not miscarry by reason of the refusal to allow an appellant to run a new and different case on the question of re-sentence. Exceptional cases apart, the question of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is answered by consideration of the material that was before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of post-sentence conduct.”


	
	In Deng, James J commented on a passage in the reasons of Howie AJ in R v Fordham [16]  in the following terms:
	


“[41]   In argument on the appeal counsel for the respondent referred to another part of the judgment of Howie AJ in Fordham where his Honour said (at p 377):–

‘Absent sentencing error which requires the Court to re-sentence an appellant, the Court should in my view, resist attempts to place before it material which was not before the sentencing judge’.

…

[43]   … I would understand [Howie AJ] as saying that, if there has not been any sentencing error then, in general, evidence which was not before the sentencing judge will not be admissible on an appeal against sentence and as implying that, if there has been sentencing error, certain kinds of evidence may be admissible on an appeal but not as implying that, if there has been sentencing error, all kinds of evidence which might be relevant to sentencing are admissible on an appeal, notwithstanding that they were not before the sentencing judge.

[44]   In the same paragraph of his judgment in Fordham in which Howie AJ made the remark I have been discussing, his Honour said:–

“Those representing an accused person before the trial court ‘have a wide discretion to conduct the defence as they see fit and this Court should not generally interfere in the exercise of that discretion (his Honour cited R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677). I see no reason why that principle should not apply, at least to the same extent, to sentencing proceedings as it does to the actual trial.’”


	
	The submission put to the Court in Betts was contrary to the conclusion reached in Deng; [17]  it was rejected, thereby affirming the approach accepted by James J in Deng.
	
	
	It is not necessary for present purposes to consider whether evidence which was either obtained and not relied upon, or was reasonably available but not obtained, could ever (and if so in what circumstances) form the basis for an application for leave to appeal against sentence. What may be accepted, however, is that evidence which was not obtained because it was not available in the exercise of reasonable diligence, may be admissible in order to show that the sentencing process miscarried, although that is only likely to be in exceptional cases and will depend upon the nature of the evidence.
	
	
	In the present case, the evidence concerned the applicant’s deteriorating health at the time of sentencing and subsequently. Such evidence should be distinguished from evidence which had potential consequences for the moral culpability of the applicant at the date of his offending, as was the case in Betts.
	
	
	There is another kind of evidence which arguably falls into a different category. That is evidence which may not have been available at the time of sentencing, but which demonstrates that the circumstances of imprisonment are harsher, due to the deteriorating condition of the offender, than had been anticipated at the time of sentence. In respect of such evidence, Street CJ stated in Vachalec, immediately after the passage referred to above at [10]:
	


“But, as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. … Administrative miscarriage in the working out of a sentence cannot be remedied by this Court as it has no jurisdiction to enter the administrative field. There could, of course, be cases where significant administrative miscarriage was so plainly foreseeable at the time of sentence as to justify this Court finding error in the sentencing decision of the first instance court. Such cases will be rare, and the present is not among them.”


	
	There is some tension between the principle that the Court should generally only consider admitting fresh evidence and the principle that anything that has happened since sentencing (being the most obvious category of fresh evidence) is a matter for the executive and not for the court on an application for leave to appeal against sentence. There is a further problem, particularly with medical conditions, in identifying what is properly described as “fresh evidence”. For example, there was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant was in declining health. He had not been diagnosed as suffering from dementia at that stage, nor, it may be accepted, should such a diagnosis have then been made. However, the fact that a psychiatrist has (for sound reasons) later proffered such a diagnosis does not necessarily mean that there is some fresh material which might have affected the sentencing, had the diagnosis then been available.
	
	
	In Khoury v The Queen, [18]  Simpson J stated that “[i]f evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion – the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance.” That statement was worded in the past tense because of the understood need to distinguish between “events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing” (which cannot be taken into account) [19]  and those facts or circumstances which “existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time”. [20]  Nevertheless, Simpson J suggested that “[t]oo rigid an application of the principle clearly has potential to be the cause of injustice, and has led to the development of the sub-set of evidentiary propositions peculiar to the admission of additional evidence in applications for leave to appeal against sentence.” [21]  After noting the further difficulty in determining whether the relevant “event or circumstance” is the psychological condition or the diagnosis [22]  Simpson J concluded: [23] 
	


“For myself, I would question the too ready acceptance that a psychological report post dating sentencing, is, because it is prepared after sentencing, fresh or new evidence. The substance of the evidence is not the existence of the report, but the history and opinions expressed in the report concerning the applicant's psychological condition.”


	
	Simpson J further emphasised that, even if the evidence did cast light on circumstances known but not fully appreciated at the time of sentencing, the admission of such evidence remained a discretionary function of the court. [24]  Not only is that desirable in order to ensure that evidence which might have been obtained prior to sentencing is not deliberately held back, as a forensic stratagem, but also because of the need to assess the materiality of the evidence.
	
	
	The evidence sought to be relied upon in the present case has been identified by R A Hulme J in terms which need not be repeated. As he explains, the evidence now proffered should not properly have resulted in a more lenient sentence. Accordingly, the evidence should not be admitted. If it were thought appropriate to admit the evidence in the particular circumstances of this application, it nevertheless could not provide a sufficient basis for a grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mr Richard Wright seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Woodburne SC in the District Court at Sydney on 6 February 2015 in respect of a number of child sexual assault offences he committed in the early 1960's upon his stepdaughter.
	
	
	Her Honour imposed an overall sentence of 4 years 5 months with a non-parole component of 2 years dating from 2 October 2014. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 1 October 2016.
	
	
	Details of the individual offences, maximum penalties and sentences imposed appear in the following table. Each offence is contrary to sections of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Each sentence was reduced by 12.5 per cent because of the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty.
	



	
		
			
			Count 1
			
			
			Indecent assault (s 76 – max 5 years) between 1.1.61 and 30.4.62

			NPP 1 year 3 months
			
		
	



	
	The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
	


""Fresh evidence in respect of the applicant's health shows that a miscarriage of justice occurred in the sentence proceedings.""


	
	The ""fresh evidence"" concerns an aspect of the applicant's health which was not discovered until after he was sentenced. He has been diagnosed as suffering from Probable Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's disease.
	


Facts


	
	The complainant was born in 1948. Her mother married the applicant in 1959 when he was aged 29. He was born in 1930 and is now aged 86.
	
	
	Count 1: Sometime between 1 January 1961 and 30 April 1962 when the complainant was aged 12 or 13 there was an occasion when the applicant put a towel on the complainant's bed and put oil on his hands. While she was lying on the towel he rubbed her thighs and digitally penetrated her vagina. Her mother witnessed this and asked what was going on. The applicant replied, ""I'm helping her to lose weight, what do you think is going on here?"" The mother left the room and the applicant continued what he was doing.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge assessed this offence as ""a very serious instance of an offence of its type"".
	
	
	Count 2: Sometime between 24 October 1961 and 30 April 1962 when the complainant was aged 13 there was an occasion when she was in a bedroom and the applicant entered wearing only a shirt. She was shocked to see his erect penis. He commanded her to lay on the bed and he removed her clothing. He rubbed her genitalia and digitally penetrated her vagina a number of times which caused a stinging sensation. He then said to her, ""I love you, I love you, you're ripe for the picking. When I married your mother she wasn't a virgin but you are"". He then inserted his penis in her vagina which caused her to cry out in pain. He said to her, ""Shh"". The complainant experienced immense pain and blacked out. She was unable to say for how long he penetrated her. When he finished he wiped her vagina roughly with a towel.
	
	
	This offence was assessed by the judge as being ""a very serious example of an offence committed in contravention of s 73 Crimes Act"".
	
	
	Count 3: This event occurred later on the same day as the event in Count 2. The complainant was in the lounge room and he told her, ""I love you, you're so special"". They kissed and he laughed because she was responding to him. He then had penile vaginal intercourse with her on the linoleum covered floor which she found to be extremely painful.
	
	
	The judge assessed this offence as serious, but less so than the offence in Count 2.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact that the applicant continued having sexual intercourse with the complainant over the following years. He would take her in his car to secluded locations. The complainant recalled that if she was having a bad day or was upset the applicant would say to her, ""I know what you need"", meaning that he would have sex with her.
	
	
	Count 4: This event occurred between 24 October 1963 and 23 October 1964 when the complainant was aged 15. He took her for a drive to a secluded location when he had penile vaginal intercourse with her which culminated in him ejaculating on the ground beside her.
	
	
	The judge accepted the submission by the applicant's counsel that this offence was not the most serious example of such offending (the Crown did not contend that it was) but it remained a serious matter.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	A victim impact statement was prepared by the complainant and read out in the District Court. The learned judge regarded it as ""an eloquent reminder to this Court and the community of the damage done by the criminal actions of the offender"". She described the statement as an expression by the complainant of ""the continuing emotional and psychological damage caused by the offender's actions"" and noted that the ""hurt, pain and dislocation has endured over many years"". She considered it was to the complainant's credit ""that she had survived the sexual assaults committed upon her and that she has managed to have the courage and fortitude to appear before the Court to inform the Court of the damage done"".
	
	
	There is no complaint about the manner in which the judge had regard to the statement. It describes in considerable detail the variety of very tragic and deleterious effects that offences of this type can cause their victims. The psychological, emotional and life-changing responses of the complainant, even over half a century after her abuse by the applicant, are palpable.
	


Complaint, investigation and the course of proceedings


	
	The complainant made her first complaint to the authorities when she was living in Western Australia in mid-2009.
	
	
	In September 2009 the applicant was interviewed by Western Australian police in relation to his offending in the late 1980's and early 1990's in relation to two other female children, one being his step-granddaughter. During that interview he made partial admissions of having interfered with the complainant in the present matter.
	
	
	In September 2010 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court of Western Australia in relation to the offences concerning the other children. He received a sentence of 18 months imprisonment which was suspended for 2 years.
	
	
	The Western Australian police sent information to police in this State in November 2010 and an investigation commenced. In September 2013 an arrest warrant was issued which was executed in November that year in Queensland where the applicant was then living. He was extradited to this State and remained in custody until he was released on bail in March 2014.
	
	
	The applicant was committed for trial on 8 May 2014. A trial in the District Court was scheduled for 29 September 2014. In the weeks preceding the trial the applicant instructed his solicitors to enter into charge negotiations with the prosecutor which led to pleas of guilty being entered on 29 September 2014.
	
	
	The matter came before Woodburne SC DCJ on 18 December 2014. Judgment was reserved and the applicant was sentenced by her Honour on 6 February 2015.
	
	
	The Registrar granted an application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 10 April 2015. The life of the notice was twice extended, ultimately to 30 March 2016. The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 9 March 2016. Accordingly, notwithstanding the time that had elapsed, no extension of time is required. Although I make no criticism, it is unfortunate that the matter has taken so long to proceed in the appellate phase given the applicant's non-parole period expires on 1 October 2016.
	


The applicant's personal circumstances including his ill-health


	
	The judge stated that the determination of the appropriate sentence was made more complex in this case by reason of the passage of time; the change in sentencing practices in the ensuing period; the applicant's advanced age (she noted he was soon to turn 85); delay; and ill-health.
	
	
	A number of documents concerning the applicant's ill-health were tendered in the sentencing proceedings: reports by Dr Emma Brown, the applicant's general practitioner, and Dr Stuart Reader, ophthalmologist; Justice Health medical records and a summary of the same; and an affidavit by the applicant.
	
	
	The judge noted that in the applicant's affidavit he listed his health conditions: advanced macular degeneration, being almost completely blind in one eye; chronic obstructive airway disease; chronic renal failure; hyperthyroidism; peptic ulcer; arthritis; and other degenerative changes. He said that he suffered from dizziness, shortness of breath and nose bleeds and back pain from a previous back injury.
	
	
	Dr Brown's report confirmed that the applicant had significant visual loss due to macular degeneration; chronic kidney disease requiring blood test monitoring; hypertension and hyperthyroidism requiring regular oral medication; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring inhaled therapy. She considered that whilst the future of these conditions was uncertain, the applicant's renal function and respiratory condition may well deteriorate.
	
	
	Dr Reader confirmed a diagnosis of advanced macular degeneration. It was his opinion that the condition could continue to deteriorate. He said, ""Given the fact that the offender is almost legally blind, a period of incarceration would be more difficult for him in relation to his ocular problems"".
	
	
	The Justice Health records related to the period in which the applicant was in custody from 21 November 2013 to 26 March 2014. He had received treatment at the eye clinic at Prince of Wales Hospital and had also been referred for physiotherapy for bilateral arthritis and osteoporosis treatment. He had also been referred to a psychologist because he was teary and not coping being in custody. Arrangements were made to have his blood pressure checked weekly. He was housed on a downstairs level to minimise the risk of falls.
	
	
	The judge referred to all of these matters (I have drawn the above summary from her judgment). She considered that the applicant's various conditions were amenable to treatment in the custodial environment although she added that she was not discounting their relevance. Her Honour accepted that imprisonment would be ""a greater burden on him by reason of his state of health and his advanced age"". This was relevant to the determination of the length of a sentence of imprisonment including the non-parole period.
	
	
	Another aspect rendering the applicant's custodial experience more difficult that the judge took into account was the fact that he would be separated from his 90 year old wife and other family members who lived interstate and were unable to visit regularly.
	
	
	A short time later in the judgment her Honour reiterated that she accepted the applicant would ""find his incarceration more difficult than would otherwise be the case than if he was in good health and not of advanced age"". It was ""a significant consideration and a matter that calls for mitigation of punishment"". (Emphasis added)
	
	
	Other matters taken into account in the assessment of sentence included the applicant's prior good character; he had no criminal history at the time of the index offences. This was considered in the context of him having offended over a number of years. Reference was also made to the subsequent sexual offending against two children in Western Australia. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had family support as indicated by their presence in court and by a testimonial by the daughter of his current wife. (His former wife of 42 years, the mother of the complainant, had died in 2002 and he remarried in 2005.)
	
	
	The judge was not satisfied that the applicant had any insight or remorse for his offending and the impact of that offending upon the complainant. Nevertheless she accepted that he was unlikely to reoffend given his age and ill-health.
	
	
	The delay in the present matters being prosecuted and brought to finalisation was taken into account. Her Honour’s consideration of this issue was detailed and, given there is now no complainant about the subject it is unnecessary to say more except to observe that her Honour noted and took into account that the applicant had aged and his health had deteriorated.
	
	
	Another aspect of delay that her Honour dealt with was the fact that it was necessary for sentencing to be assessed with regard to the significant change in the approach to sentencing in the period since the offences were committed. She referred to relevant authority in this Court on the subject (e.g. the five-judge bench decision in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368) and, again, given there is no complaint about the manner in which her Honour dealt with this issue there is no need to say more.
	
	
	Special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found so as to justify a reduction in the proportion of the sentences (including the total effective sentence) represented by the non-parole component. This finding was based upon a combination of the changed sentencing practices; the applicant's age and ill-health; the conditions he would experience in custody; and the fact that individual sentences would be partially accumulated.
	


The fresh evidence


	
	An affidavit by the applicant's present solicitor affirmed on 3 March 2016 was read at the hearing of the application. Annexed to the affidavit was a report by Dr Sharon Reutens, consultant psychiatrist, of 25 February 2016 as well as a number of documents to which she had referred including a report of a neuropsychological assessment by Dr Susan van den Berg dated 4 September 2015.
	
	
	Dr van den Berg’s report includes the following:
	


“The predominant impression is that Alzheimer’s pathology is the most likely underlying cause of Mr Wright’s presentation.

…

Mr Wright’s diagnosis remains tentative and he will require follow up to monitor his functioning. Reassessment in 12 months is recommended, using the current results as a baseline, to help clarify the clinical picture and confirm the diagnosis.

Given Mr Wright’s advancing age, physical limitations and cognitive difficulties, he is likely to be vulnerable in a mainstream custodial setting. It is also likely that his cognitive abilities will decline over time. As such, he would benefit from placement in a supportive environment which is able to cater for his aged care needs, such as the Kevin Waller Unit at Long Bay Correctional Complex.”


	
	Dr Reutens' curriculum vitae includes that she has advanced training in neuropsychiatry and old age psychiatry. She is employed as a Senior Visiting Medical Officer in Psychogeriatrics with Justice Health and as such is involved in management of the psychiatric needs of the older inmate population.
	
	
	Dr Reutens’ diagnosis of the applicant was: Probable Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. She wrote:
	


""The diagnosis of a DSM 5 Major Neurocognitive Disorder, more commonly termed dementia, was made on the basis of a history of memory deficits that were more prominent for recent than remote events. Mr Wright had deficits of memory, attention and executive function (planning, language generation, abstract thinking) and orientation, indicating that the impairment affected several areas of cognition.

… The documentation does not indicate any abrupt cognitive decline or significant illnesses, and the cognitive impairments noted on neuropsychological testing about 6 months prior are roughly similar. Therefore, a slow degenerative disease such as an Alzheimer's-type dementia, possibly with concomitant vascular aetiology (based on the history of hypertension and past history of smoking) is the most probable cause of the cognitive impairment.""


	
	She described Alzheimer's and Vascular type dementias as slowly progressing conditions that present with obvious clinical symptoms some years after the onset of the disease. She considered that the applicant ""most likely had cognitive impairment while he was on remand"". An episode of confusion recorded in the Justice Health records on 31 January 2014 was, with hindsight, a warning sign of cognitive impairment.
	
	
	When asked by the applicant's solicitor in his letter requesting Dr Reutens to make an assessment of his client whether incarceration affects the symptoms of the condition she responded: ""incarceration is unlikely to affect the pathogenesis or expression of the disease in any material way"".
	
	
	As to whether the applicant's experience of incarceration is affected by the symptoms of the condition she wrote:
	


""[The applicant's] experience of incarceration is affected because of the combination of dementia with his sensory impairments. He is essentially blind and at the interview appeared to have a hearing impairment as well. One of the mainstays of therapy for dementia is activity. Diversional activities provide quality of life, and mitigate against the development of behavioural disturbance of dementia (BPSD), however there are limited activities that are able to be provided in prison, and [the applicant] cannot participate in most of the offered activities in the Kevin Waller Unit (gardening, reading, painting) because of the visual impairment, and he has nothing to occupy him after lock-in in the afternoon.

Therefore, he is currently experiencing greater hardship than most of the other older prisoners in the Wing.""


	
	Dr Reutens said that to mitigate the symptoms, the applicant ""would, ideally, be able to engage in meaningful activities suitable for visually impaired people with cognitive impairment. If he were in the community, [the applicant] could attend a centre with activities for cognitively impaired people"". She added:
	


""He is at risk for delirium due to his cognitive deterioration and sensory impairment. Therefore a regular routine and limiting changes in his cell placement would help prevent episodes of confusion.""


	
	Dr Reutens referred to a relevant academic work and reported that the prognosis for Alzheimer's dementia is of a gradual deterioration in cognition until death. Given his advanced age, the applicant would be expected to be at the shorter end of the range of life span, something in the order of several years. She said that during this time it is expected that he would gradually lose independence and will become carer dependent, culminating in the terminal stage where he would be unaware of his environment.
	
	
	In a further report dated 7 June 2016 (annexed to an affidavit affirmed by the applicant's solicitor on 8 June 2016) Dr Reutens noted a number of difficulties the applicant had experienced in custody in attending to daily activities (for example, requiring prompting to shower and assistance to ensure he took medications). She referred to the applicant lacking the assistance a person with cognitive impairment can rely upon by way of visual prompts, cues and reminders. She said he would benefit from having a carer to assist him. She also referred to various facilities that are available in the community to assist persons in the applicant's situation: home care; a community team or carer to liaise with services that could assist; and adult day care centres to provide diversional activities and social interaction.
	
	
	Other material annexed to the solicitor's affidavit of 8 June is informative of the various services and facilities that could be available to the applicant in the community.
	
	
	An affidavit sworn by the ""inmate-carer"" assigned to the Kevin Waller Unit where the applicant has been held since shortly after he was sentenced provides information as to the care and assistance he provides to the applicant and the other 21 elderly male inmates of the unit. A number of these inmates suffer from dementia as well as a range of other physical disabilities. Reference is made to the apparent confusion expressed by the applicant as to why he is there and when he is due for release.
	


Principles in relation to fresh evidence and their application


	
	There are limits on the ability of this Court to receive fresh or new evidence. Simpson J (as her Honour then was) provided a most detailed and useful summary of the relevant principles in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [104]-[121]. It is, however, sufficient for present purposes to refer to the more succinct summary provided in the written submissions of senior counsel for the applicant:
	


1.   ""Fresh evidence"" is to be distinguished from ""new evidence"": fresh evidence is evidence which was not available or which could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of sentence; new evidence is evidence which was available but not used or which could have been obtained with reasonable diligence: R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330.

2.   Generally, neither fresh evidence nor new evidence is received on appeal, as a reflection of the principle of finality: Cornwell v R [2015] NSWCCA 269 at [39]. Fresh evidence or new evidence will only be received where a miscarriage of justice is shown: R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377-378; or where it is in the interests of justice: Cornwell v R at [59].

3.   Evidence of events or circumstances that have arisen entirely since sentence is not received. However, evidence may be received of events or circumstances which existed at the time of sentence but which were unknown, or the significance of which was unappreciated. The rationale for reception of the evidence is that the court proceeded on an erroneous view of the facts: Khoury v R at [110]-[115].

4.   The determination to receive the evidence is discretionary. Caution must be exercised and a proper basis for admission of the evidence must be established: Khoury v R at [117].

5.   Factors relevant to the determination to receive the evidence include the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the failure to produce the evidence at first instance and the potential significance of the evidence to the outcome: Khoury v R at [121].


	
	The final point was elaborated upon earlier in the judgment of Simpson J in Khoury v R:
	


""[108] If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham.""


	
	In his judgment in Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186, Beech-Jones J referred (at [66]) to three examples of the application of the principle concerning the receipt of evidence derived after sentencing:
	


a)   Where the offender was diagnosed with a condition after sentence but was affected by it at the time of sentence.

b)   Where, although the symptoms of a condition may have been present, their significance was not appreciated at the time of sentencing.

c)   Where a person was sentenced on the expectation that they would receive a particular level of medical care and attention in custody but they did not.

Submissions for the applicant


	
	In the present case it is contended that the evidence qualifies as ""fresh evidence"" and that it falls within the first and second of the examples referred to by Beech-Jones J in Turkmani v R. The episode of confusion exhibited by the applicant in January 2014 was referred to as indicating that the onset of dementia pre-dated the applicant’s sentencing.
	
	
	As to the significance of the evidence, senior counsel for the applicant submitted, first, that the sentencing judge found that there was no evidence that the applicant would not receive appropriate medical treatment in prison, whereas the fresh evidence establishes that his imprisonment limits his access to therapy recommended for his disease. Secondly, it was submitted that while the judge accepted that the applicant's imprisonment would be more burdensome because of his age and poor health, the fresh evidence establishes that it may be a greater burden than was anticipated.
	
	
	For these reasons, it was submitted, the factual basis upon which sentence was determined was erroneous and there had thereby been a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant raised a new argument at the hearing of the application. By reference to R v AB [2015] NSWCCA 57 he contended that some of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to which the sentencing judge had regard were really inapt in the applicant's circumstances; specifically, denunciation and making him accountable for his actions. If the judge had been aware of what is now known about the applicant there would have been a significant difference in the sentence imposed.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	Senior counsel for the Crown conceded that it would be open to the Court to receive the evidence on the basis identified in the submissions for the applicant.
	
	
	It was not, however, conceded that the evidence establishes that the applicant's custodial experience is more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced.
	
	
	Reference was made to Dr Reutens’ first report in which she spoke of the inevitable progression of the applicant’s dementia and identified the ""limited treatments available"". It was argued that there was nothing in the report to suggest that the applicant is not being appropriately cared for in custody.
	
	
	A further submission was that the applicant's non-parole period of 2 years expires in under 4 months time on 1 October 2016. There is no evidence that in the 16 months that have elapsed since he was sentenced and returned to custody there has been any decline in his ability to manage. Further, there is no evidence that any further (gradual) decline in the ensuing months will be of such magnitude so as to impact on his ability to manage in a manner similar to which he has to date.
	
	
	In short, the Crown submitted that when regard is had to the range of ill-health factors, coupled with the applicant's advanced age, to which the sentencing judge had regard, this Court would not be satisfied that incarceration would be more onerous than her Honour anticipated. The offences were found to be objectively serious and the Crown contended that the fresh evidence did not justify any reduction when ""considerable leniency"" had already been factored into the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	In meeting the new argument based upon R v AB that was raised by the applicant at the hearing, senior counsel for the Crown contended that the circumstances of that case were quite different to those of the present case
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence properly qualifies as fresh evidence that this Court could receive in accordance with the principles to which I have earlier referred. I am not, however, persuaded that the Court should exercise its discretion to receive it because it is insufficient to warrant a fresh assessment of sentence. (I have since had the benefit of reading in draft the very useful analysis of Basten JA which further confirms the view I have formed.)
	
	
	The primary judge's reasons disclose that she approached her task very carefully, giving attention to both the seriousness of the offences as well as the substantial mitigation arising from various factors including (but not limited to) the applicant's advanced age and his multifaceted ill-health. She said a number of times that the applicant's incarceration would be more difficult than it otherwise might be. She regarded this as ""a significant consideration and a matter that calls for mitigation of punishment and a matter to be brought into account … in the determination of the appropriate sentence"".
	
	
	Sympathies might be aroused by the reports that have recently come to hand which disclose that an elderly inmate who was sentenced on the basis of having a variety of significant conditions of physical ill-health is now found to have dementia from which he is gradually declining. But is more weight to the difficulties of being incarcerated justified when such consideration already formed a major component of the assessment of sentence? In my view, in the circumstances of this case that question must be answered in the negative. The sentence imposed already represents a lenient outcome when regard is had to the gravity of the applicant's offending and the enduring harm that it caused.
	


R v AB


	
	The argument of senior counsel for the applicant concerning the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires some detailed attention. The circumstances in R v AB were, as the Crown contended, rather different. There the respondent was the subject of a special hearing under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) because he had been found unfit to be tried on a charge of having murdered his estranged wife. He was aged 64 at the time of the killing and was almost 69 at the time the case was finalised. Psychiatric opinion was to the effect that he suffered from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He was also diagnosed with dementia (probably caused by long term hazardous alcohol consumption), cerebro vascular disease and possible Alzheimer's dementia. There were also a number of physical ailments.
	
	
	The primary judge found the respondent to be not guilty of murder but that on the limited evidence available he had committed the offence of manslaughter upon the basis of him being substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind (s 23A of the Crimes Act). A limiting term of 7 years was imposed. (No non-parole period is specified when a limiting term is nominated.) In the course of his reasons the primary judge said:
	


""A limiting term that is likely to end after an offender's understanding of where he or she is and why serves no useful public purpose and is, therefore, pointless … .""


	
	One of the grounds of the Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of the limiting term was that the judge ""erred in principle in his statement of a 'purpose' of a limiting term"". The ground was rejected.
	
	
	Simpson J (as her Honour then was) set out the various purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A:
	


“(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""


	
	She found (at [42]) the matter in (a) to be irrelevant by reference to authority for the proposition that the purpose of nominating a limiting term is not to punish. That is the first difference with the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	Her Honour said that findings of the primary judge (the respondent's mental disability rendered him an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence and he would not commit another act of violence) rendered the matters in (b)-(e) irrelevant.
	
	
	Her Honour also considered (at [45]) that denunciation of the respondent's conduct was in the same category as general deterrence because both stemmed from his diminished moral culpability which in turn arose from his impaired mental capacity.
	
	
	Recognition of the harm done to the deceased, her daughter and to the community was held to remain of relevance and it was not established that the primary judge had overlooked the fact.
	
	
	In the present case the judge made reference to s 3A and, after listing its content, she remarked: ""Of course, the weight to be attributed to each of these matters depends on the facts of the case"". She continued:
	


""In the present case it remains important to denounce the offender's crimes, to make him accountable for his actions and to recognise the harm done to the victims of the crime and the community"".


	
	The sentence to be imposed upon the applicant was to be in the form of a punishment, unlike the limiting term in R v AB. Accordingly, it was appropriate for her Honour to have regard to the need to ensure the respondent was adequately punished for his offences (with such assessment having to be made in the light of all relevant factors). There was no suggestion of the respondent's moral culpability for his crimes being diminished and so denunciation was also a matter her Honour could factor into the assessment (qualified by the various mitigating features). Finally, there was no argument about the relevance of recognising the harm done to the complainant. As to the other purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A, the judge made no other specific reference to them so it may be assumed that they did not loom large in her approach.
	
	
	Another point of distinction between the present case and R v AB is that the length of the limiting term under consideration in the latter was significantly longer than the sentence in this case (7 years as opposed to a non-parole period of 2 years). The concern of the primary judge in that case not to impose a term that would exceed the period in which the respondent would retain some awareness of where he was, and why, does not have the same degree of significance in this case.
	
	
	I am not persuaded of the applicant's contention that the fresh material presented to this Court would have made a significant difference to the sentence.

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove AJ. 

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Grove AJ. 

3GROVE AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ at Sydney District Court. 

4The applicant had been committed for sentence following pleas of guilty in the Local Court to 3 charges of stealing from a person contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900. That provision prescribes a maximum available penalty for a single offence of 14 years imprisonment. Without detailing orders for commencement and expiry, his Honour sentenced the applicant for the first offence to imprisonment for 2 years 3 months with a non parole period of 1 year 5 months 17 days; for the second offence to imprisonment for 1 year 10 months with a non parole period of 1 year 2 months 18 days and for the third offence to imprisonment for 3 years with a non parole period of 1 year 11 months 12 days. 

5It was common ground between counsel for the applicant and for the Crown that, allowing for orders of partial cumulation, the overall effective sentence was 3 years 11 months with a non parole period of 2 years 10 months 12 days. 

6The applicant appeared for sentence with a co-offender Jose Lues Rios and, as his Honour observed, the same facts related to them both. From an agreed statement he extracted this description of the offences: 

""The first offence occurred on 5 June 2008. On that day Mr Naime Mikael was aged seventy-nine years. He was doing his banking at the Commonwealth Bank at the Bankstown Shopping Centre. Mr Mikael withdrew $3,500 in cash from an account that he had at that bank. The money was to assist his son in Lebanon with medical expenses. 

After withdrawing the money Mr Mikael placed it in one of his trouser pockets and left the bank to walk to his car which was nearby. 

Whilst still within the shopping centre Mr Mikael felt a bump and someone touching his right side. He felt in his pocket. The money was gone. 

When police attended the scene they obtained access to CCTV footage which showed the offenders present in that part of the shopping centre where Mr Mikael had been robbed. This footage showed Mr Rios stepping in front of Mr Mikael causing him to stop and Ms Ruano then moving in and stealing the money. A third person (a male) named Carlos was seen to be helping her. A fourth person (Mr Augustine Bolanos who at one point was in the shopping centre with the other offenders) was waiting outside the shopping centre in his motor vehicle and drove the three other offenders from the scene. 

The second offence occurred on 28 May 2009. On that day Ms Fensury Wongjamrat was doing her banking in the St George Bank in Haymarket. Ms Wongjamrat was intending to make a deposit of an amount of $1,600. On entering the bank she sat on a seat in the public waiting area and counted the money she intended to deposit. When she finished that task, Ms Wongjamrat placed the money in an A4 envelope which in turn was placed in a small personal shopping cart. Mr Rios was lurking in the bank and watched Ms Wongjamrat counting her money. Whilst watching her Mr Rios made a mobile phone call to Ms Ruano who shortly thereafter entered the bank and had a conversation with Mr Rios. A third unknown person, a male, who was an associate of Mr Rios and Ms Ruano, also entered the branch at the same time as Ms Ruano. 

Mr Rios and Ms Ruano then made their move on Ms Wongjamrat. Ms Ruano took up a seat directly opposite her and Mr Rios took a seat directly behind her. Mr Rios then engaged Ms Wongjamrat in conversation. Whilst Ms Wongjamarut had turned to face Mr Rios, Ms Ruano reached into her trolley and removed the envelope. Both Mr Rios, Ms Ruano and the unknown male then swiftly left the premises. Ms Wongjamarut almost immediately thereafter realised that her money was missing. This incident was also recorded by CCTV in the bank. 

The third offence occurred on 10 August 2009. On that day Ms Phung went to the Westpac Bank in Haymarket where she withdrew on behalf of her employer the amount of $21,296 in cash. This money was placed in a hessian bag with the Westpac logo on it and given to Ms Phung. She then placed the hessian bag in her handbag and went to the ANZ Bank at Haymarket where it was her intention to deposit the money into another account of her employer. She collected a ticket from the automated ticketing machine and sat in the public area of the bank waiting for the number on that ticket to be called. While she was waiting Ms Phung removed the hessian bag from her handbag and the cash from the hessian bag and began to count it. 

Mr Rios was already in the ANZ Bank at the time Ms Phung entered. Upon seeing Ms Phung counting the money he made a mobile phone call and shortly thereafter Ms Ruano entered the bank with the same unknown man who was involved in the second offence, together with a fourth unknown man. 

All four offenders took up positions in the public waiting areas of the bank. Mr Rios approached Ms Phung and asked her to get up while he searched under her seat, saying that he had lost his credit card. Ms Phung placed the money back into the hessian bag which in turn was placed into her handbag and she moved to another seat. Mr Rios then repositioned himself behind Ms Phung and smeared a quantity of wasabi on her back. Ms Phung felt something touch her and got up from her seat to move away. When she got up the two unknown males approached her and said, ""There is a lot of wasabi on your back and the chair."" These two men then pretended to offer assistance to Ms Phung. Whilst she was distracted by this activity, Ms Ruano arranged to sit beside her. The unknown males continued to distract Ms Phung and in the deliberately designed confusion Ms Ruano reached into Ms Phung's bag and removed the hessian Westpac bag. After covering that bag with a scarf Ms Ruano left the bank, followed swiftly by Mr Rios and the other unknown male persons. 

The entirety of the third offence was also captured on CCTV. 

Both of the present offenders were arrested on 14 August 2009. 

On 19 August 2009 the police gained access to a room at the Westside Motor Inn at Ashfield in which the two offenders had been staying immediately before their arrest. Amongst the items found on that day was $17,000 in cash, $US3,700, 11,800 Euros and a small quantity of Vietnamese and New Zealand currency, some counterfeit Australian currency to the value of $400 and a quantity of jewellery."" 

7The Crown sought an order for forfeiture of the Australian and foreign currency found in the motel room. 

8After some debate, an assertion by the Crown that the offenders were working as part of a highly organised syndicate of thieves across Sydney was acknowledged. 

9The applicant's life had been one of deprivation and tragedy, but also, I regret to observe, of persistent criminal behaviour. His Honour's summary need not be repeated but background included her birth in Colombia, abandonment of her mother by her father whose identity she does not know and subjection to rape after entering domestic service at the age of 11. At 16 she began a relationship with a man over twice her age and they, apparently illegally, entered the United States where he taught her to be a thief, as a result of which she acquired a history of offences in that country, particularly in the New York area. She bore this man two children although he abandoned her before the second child was born and she subsequently learned that he had died. 

10Later in life the applicant bore two more children to another man who also left her. She had become a heavy drinker and gambler and addicted to drugs. During the last decade of the Twentieth Century, she came to Australia with her two youngest children where she met another man whom she married. Following convictions for stealing, the last in 2002, she was deported in 2004 after serving sentences. Her younger children now reside with her eldest child in Colombia and the remaining child lives in Canada. 

11On 12 August 2007 the applicant re-entered Australia under the alias Rosalba Herrera-Padilla. She discovered that her husband had formed a new relationship and subsequently she became associated with her co-offender, Rios. 

12It is expected that she will again be deported when custody is complete. 

13The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal. Ground 1 asserts that the learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the fact that each of the counts could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have proper regard to the maximum penalty in such a case. 

14His Honour did not overlook these circumstances. He said: 

""These offences could have been dealt with summarily , however the degree of planing involved and the amount particularly of the third offence meant that in my view it was appropriate for the sentencing process to be undertaken in this Court. But the fact that the Local Court could have been the Court in which the offender could have been sentenced is not irrelevant."" 


15It was submitted that his Honour's remark that the Local Court potential was not irrelevant was opaque and there should have been attention directed to the distinction between the first and the second offences on the one hand and the third offence on the other in that there was a lower Local Court maximum penalty for the first and second than that available for the third. The factor for differential was the amount of money involved. 

16I do not find his Honour's remark opaque. It is consistent with the proposition that the existence of possible Local Court jurisdiction is a matter to be taken into account but not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

17The invitation specifically to advert to the graded penalties in the Local Court implies that they should provide some proportion or scaling to assessment of penalty. So to use them would be erroneous. In the light of the applicant's participation in the offences it could not be contended that it was inappropriate for the Crown to elect to prosecute in the District Court. The summary extracted above shows that on each occasion it was the applicant who physically removed the money from the targeted victim. This is consistent with her frank admission that from an early age in the USA she had been taught to be a thief. Untainted by error, once the election was made to prosecute in the District Court a sentencing Judge would use the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament for the offence in the same way as it would be used for any offence cognisable within the jurisdiction of that Court. The weight, if any, to be given to the circumstance that Parliament has legislated that in some circumstances offences against a provision might be prosecuted in a Court of limited jurisdiction is a matter for judgment in each case. There was no error in his Honour gauging his assessments, inter alia , against the maximum penalty prescribed, nor in the conclusions as to impositions which he reached. 

18Ground 2 asserted that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to structure the sentences imposed so far as to (i) give proper effect to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and (ii) to vary the statutory ratio having expressly stated his intention to do so. 

19His Honour made an express finding: 

""I accept that imprisonment for her will be much harsher than for others because of her limited, almost non-existent English and her total lack of social support from friends or family. In these circumstances I am prepared to find special circumstances."" 

20It is not intended as criticism, but the somewhat unrounded terms of specification of non parole periods in particular make exact analysis awkward but the Crown has fairly acknowledged first, that it appears that it was his Honour's intention to depart from the formula in the statute when dividing the term into non parole period and balance term both in respect of the individual impositions and their total effect, second, that that division (to the advantage of the applicant) was not achieved when the total term and total non parole period is calculated and, third, that an adjustment to achieve approximately the same proportions in total term as was used for the individual sentences by reduction of about three months would not be argued against. 

21Ordinarily, an adjustment being sought in the order of 3 months would not attract intervention by this Court but as it is, in effect, agreed that the likely explanation for not carrying out his Honour's intention was arithmetical rather than an error of principle, fairness would dictate that it should now be done. 

22The result apparently intended by his Honour and not opposed by the Crown can, as a matter of practicability, be achieved conveniently by varying the sentence and orders in relation to the third count. 

23I propose the following orders: 

1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed in part. 

2. Sentences and orders in the District Court for offences on 5 June 2008 and 28 May 2009 confirmed. 

3. Sentence and orders for offence on 10 August 2009 quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 1 year 8 months commencing on 14 July 2010 and expiring on 13 March 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year 4 months commencing on 14 March 2012. 

4. The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole specified as 13 March 2012.

                   The accused was
involved in a fight in which a bystander was injured on the arm when a bottle,
allegedly thrown by the accused, broke against a wall and a glass fragment
struck the bystander. As a result of this incident, the accused was
charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm contrary to s. 269  of the Criminal
Code .  At the outset of the trial, the accused brought a motion to
have s. 269  declared of no force or effect on the ground that it infringed
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Before
hearing any evidence, the trial judge granted the motion and quashed the
indictment.  She found that s. 269  created criminal responsibility
for causing bodily harm by way of an unlawful act, which could include an
offence of absolute liability and, since the section also allowed the
possibility of imprisonment, it contravened s. 7  of the Charter  and
was not justified under s. 1 . On appeal, the Court of Appeal
overturned the motion judgment and set aside the order quashing the
indictment. This appeal raises two issues:  (1) whether the trial
judge followed an appropriate procedure in dealing with the motion contesting
the constitutionality of s. 269 of the Code prior to hearing any
evidence; and (2) whether s. 269  violates ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed. 
Section 269  does not violate s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                   A trial judge has
jurisdiction to dispose of a motion to quash the indictment on the grounds of
constitutional invalidity and such a motion may be brought at any time.
 The decision whether to rule on the application or to reserve until the
end of the case is a discretionary one to be exercised having regard to two
policy considerations.  The first is that criminal proceedings should not be
fragmented by interlocutory proceedings which take on a life of their own.  The
second, which relates to constitutional challenges, discourages adjudication of
constitutional issues without a factual foundation.  In exercising his
discretion, the trial judge should not depart from these policies unless there
is a strong reason for doing so.  An apparently meritorious Charter 
challenge of the law under which the accused is charged, which is not dependent
on facts to be elicited during the trial, may come within the exceptions to the
general rule. Here, the trial judge did not err in disposing of the
accused's motion before hearing evidence. No objection was taken at trial
to the procedure adopted. The Charter  challenge was not without merit
and the evidence at trial would not have assisted in the resolution of the
constitutional question given the nature of the accused's submissions. It was
irrelevant whether the facts at trial would establish a mental element
compatible with constitutional mens rea requirements, since this Court
has not adopted the ""constitutional as applied"" approach.

 

                   To be brought
within the ambit of s. 269 of the Code, an accused must have
committed an underlying unlawful offence and have caused bodily harm to another
person as a result of committing that offence.  Unlike most offences, the
mental element of s. 269  is composed of two separate requirements.  First,
the mental element of the underlying offence must be satisfied.  The
underlying offences covered by s. 269  include only federal and provincial
offences.  Excluded from this general category of offences are any offences
which are based on absolute liability or which have constitutionally
insufficient mental elements on their own. Second, the additional fault
requirement of s. 269  must be satisfied. The term ""unlawfully"" in
s. 269  requires that the underlying unlawful act ‑‑ criminal
or non‑criminal ‑‑ be at least objectively dangerous in that
a reasonable person would inevitably realize that the underlying unlawful act
would subject another person to the risk of bodily harm. This latter
requirement insures that all prosecutions under s. 269  contain at least a
fault requirement based on an objective standard.  Section 269  has
neither the stigma nor the criminal sanction to require a more demanding mental
element.  Interpreted in this way, s. 269  complies with the
requirements of s. 7  of the Charter .  There is no
constitutional requirement that intention, either on an objective or on a
subjective basis, extend to the consequences of unlawful acts in general.
 There must be an element of personal fault in regard to a culpable aspect
of the actus reus, but not necessarily in regard to each and every one
of its elements. To require fault in regard to each consequence of an action in
order to establish liability for causing that consequence would substantially
restructure current notions of criminal responsibility. In punishing for
unforeseen consequences the law is not punishing the morally innocent but those
who cause injury through avoidable unlawful action.  In the absence of a
violation of s. 7 , there is no violation of s. 11 (d) of the  Charter .

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- This appeal
concerns a constitutional challenge to s. 269  (unlawfully causing bodily
harm) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly
s. 245.3 ).  The appellant was involved in a fight in which a bystander was
injured when a bottle allegedly thrown by the appellant broke against a wall
and a glass fragment from the bottle struck the bystander.

 

                   Prior to trial, the
appellant brought a motion to have s. 269  declared of no force or effect
as contrary to s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
The appellant argued that the offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm was
contrary to fundamental justice as it put an accused at risk of imprisonment
without the requirement of a blameworthy state of mind.  Additionally, the
appellant argued that the provision allows a conviction despite an accused's
lack of intent to cause the consequence of bodily harm.  The motion succeeded
and the indictment under which the appellant stood charged was quashed.  On
appeal, the motion judgment was overturned and the order quashing the
indictment was set aside:  (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 152, 62 C.C.C. (3d) 95, 42
O.A.C. 375.

 

The Facts

 

                   As no trial has yet
been held in this matter, the facts have been taken from the evidence at the
preliminary inquiry.  The transcript of the preliminary inquiry was filed with
the Court of Appeal and with this Court as the factual basis for the appeals.

 

                   On December 31,
1987, Teresa Santos attended a New Year's Eve party in Toronto.  Shortly after
midnight, a fight broke out at the party.  As she was attempting to gather her
belongings, which were located at a table in the vicinity of the fight,
Ms. Santos was struck on the arm by a piece of glass.  The glass fragment
produced a large gash on her left forearm which required seven stitches to mend
the underlying pronator muscle in her arm and a further seven stitches to mend
the skin above the muscle.  Eight months later, the feeling and movement in the
victim's forearm was still restricted.

 

                   The victim's
husband, Fernando Santos, was standing near his wife while the fight was in
progress.  He noticed that the appellant and a number of others were involved
in the altercation.  The appellant and the Santos were standing approximately
eight feet away from a wall on opposite sides of the same table.  Some of the
men who were fighting began throwing bottles.  Mr. Santos then noticed the
appellant throw a bottle which hit the wall beside Ms. Santos and
shattered.  A piece of glass from the bottle thrown by the appellant ricocheted
off the wall and struck the victim on the arm causing her injury.  As a result
of this incident, the appellant was charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm
contrary to s. 245.3  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34
(now s. 269 ).  He was committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry held on
October 31, 1988.

 

                   At the outset of
the trial and before any evidence was heard, the accused made a motion to have
s. 269  declared of no force or effect on the ground that it contravened
s. 7  of the Charter .  The motion was granted and the indictment was
quashed.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the motion judgment was
overturned and the order quashing the indictment was set aside.  This appeal
comes before the Court as of right.

 

Points in Issue

 

                   The following
constitutional questions were stated for this appeal:

 

1.Does
s. 269 of the Criminal Code  violate s. 7  or 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is ""yes"", then is s. 269 of the Code
a reasonable limit justified by s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

                   The parties also
raise a number of other issues, the most important of which is whether the
trial judge followed an appropriate procedure in dealing with the
constitutional questions prior to hearing any evidence.

 

Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  

 

                   267. ...

 

                   (2)  For
the purposes of this section and sections 269 and 272, ""bodily harm""
means any hurt or injury to the complainant that interferes with the health or
comfort of the complainant and that is more than merely transient or trifling
in nature.

 

                   269.  Every one who unlawfully
causes bodily harm to any person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

 

(Formerly

125, s. 19).)

 

Judgments

 

A.  Ontario District
Court

 

                   The trial judge
began by noting that in the case of Gralewicz v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 493, this Court held that ""unlawful"", at least in the
context of a conspiracy, meant the contravention of any statute of Parliament
or of a provincial legislature.  Based on this case, the judge concluded that
s. 269 allowed for a conviction based on any action which violates a
federal or provincial statute, including an absolute liability offence.  She
was unwilling to interpret ""unlawful"" as only applying to underlying
offences containing a higher culpability requirement.  As s. 269 also allowed
the possibility of imprisonment, the potential combination of absolute
liability and imprisonment rendered the provision contrary to s. 7  of the Charter . 
As the Crown does not appear to have attempted to justify the violation under
s. 1 , the trial judge declared the section to be of no force or effect and
ordered that the indictment be quashed.

 

B.  Ontario Court of
Appeal (1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 95

 

                   The Court of Appeal
held that it was possible to interpret s. 269 to comply with the Charter 
and thus the section should not be struck down.  The court noted that many
provisions in the Code do not provide for specific intent requirements
pertaining to each and every ingredient of the actus reus.  In these
cases the mental element is implied so that it complies with constitutional
requirements (at p. 96):

 

                   Properly
interpreted in accordance with these principles, s. 269, which creates the
offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm, must be interpreted as requiring an
element of moral turpitude or blameworthiness which will be supplied by the
mental element which accompanies the prohibited act.

 

The court considered it unnecessary to
decide whether non-criminal unlawful acts could give rise to liability under
s. 269 or whether the unlawful act required by s. 269 needed to be of
the same nature as that required for unlawful act manslaughter.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
indicated that if the facts as described in the preliminary inquiry were
properly established at trial, it would be open to a trier of fact to find a
culpable mental element.  The court concluded that it was premature to
investigate whether this level of culpability was constitutionally sufficient. 
The court concluded by noting that ""[t]here is, however, nothing here to
suggest that, properly interpreted and applied, s. 269 infringes s. 7 
of the Charter "" (p. 96).

 

Analysis

 

                   This appeal raises
two issues.  The first is the correct procedure to be followed by a judge in
considering a pre-trial motion contesting the constitutionality of the
provision under which an accused is charged.  The second issue is whether
s. 269 of the Code violates either or both of ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .  This latter issue has two branches, (i) the mental
element required by s. 269  and whether this element is constitutionally
sufficient and (ii) whether s. 7  of the Charter  requires as a
constitutional minimum, foresight of each or any of the consequences that
comprise the actus reus of an offence.

 

A.  The Pre-Trial
Procedure

 

                   The respondent
submits that the learned trial judge erred in ruling on the application by the
appellant to declare that s. 269  of the Criminal Code  was of no
force or effect before hearing the evidence at trial.  It is clear that as the
liberty interest of the appellant is ultimately at risk in this appeal, the
appellant has the right to question the constitutional validity of the
provision under which he is charged.  This is the case even though the
unconstitutional effects may not be directed at the appellant per se (R. v. Morgentaler,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 63).  The appellant submits that this Court has
the power and the duty to review the elements of criminal offences and this is
not disputed by the Crown.  As the elements of the offence necessarily affect
adjudication under it, an accused has standing to contest the elements of any
provision under which he or she is charged.  While it is incumbent on a court
to consider such issues at some point in its deliberations, it is less clear in
what circumstances this review must or should be done prior to hearing
evidence.

 

                   The general rule
with respect to attacking an indictment by reason of a defect in law is that a
motion to quash the indictment for a defect apparent on the face thereof must
be made before pleading.  This rule is subsumed in the provisions of
s. 601(1) of the Code, which requires the motion to be made before
the plea, and thereafter only with leave of the court.  The main purpose of the
rule, and of s. 601(1) to the extent that it embodies the rule, is to ensure
that defects curable by amendment are attacked before pleading, since if not
cured by amendment they may be waived by a plea.  (See R. v. Côté,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, at p. 15; R. v. Villeneuve (1984), 54 A.R. 265
(C.A.), at p. 267; R. v. Cook (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (B.C.C.A.),
at pp. 30-31 and 40; R. v. R.I.C. (1986), 17 O.A.C. 354, at pp. 357-58; R.
v. Peremiczky (Zoly) (1973), 25 C.R.N.S. 399 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 400;
and R. v. Denton (1990), 100 N.S.R. (2d) 174 (Co. Ct.), at p. 176.)

 

                   The temporal
requirement of moving before pleading has no application, however, to a motion
to quash which questions the validity of the law under which the accused is
charged.  I expressly refrain from addressing the effect of a plea of guilty. 
(See R. v. Tennen, [1959] O.R. 77 (C.A.), aff'd [1960] S.C.R. 302, at p.
83 O.R., and R. v. Sarson (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. Gen. Div.). 
Such a defect goes to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the charge
and is not subject to the temporal restriction in s. 601(1).  Such an
application may be brought at any time.  Indeed, where the trial court is a
court of inferior jurisdiction, a motion may be brought before trial to
prohibit the trial court from proceeding.  See Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
v. Attorney-General for Ontario, [1959] S.C.R. 188, rev'g [1958] O.R. 55
(C.A.), which aff'd [1957] O.R. 466 (H.C.).  There is no question, therefore,
that the trial judge has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of a motion to quash
the indictment on the grounds of constitutional invalidity.  Whether he or she
is bound to do so or whether as a matter of practice should do so is more
problematic.

 

                   With rare
exceptions that do not apply here a trial judge is empowered to reserve on any
application until the end of the case.  He or she is not obliged, therefore, to
rule on a motion to quash for invalidity of the indictment until the end of the
case after the evidence has been heard.  The decision whether to rule on the
application or reserve until the end of the case is a discretionary one to be
exercised having regard to two policy considerations.  The first is that
criminal proceedings should not be fragmented by interlocutory proceedings
which take on a life of their own.  This policy is the basis of the rule
against interlocutory appeals in criminal matters.  See Mills v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 863.  The second, which relates to constitutional challenges,
discourages adjudication of constitutional issues without a factual
foundation.  See, for instance, Moysa v. Alberta (Labour Relations Board),
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1572, and Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1086.  Both these policies favour disposition of applications at
the end of the case.  In exercising the discretion to which I have referred the
trial judge should not depart from these policies unless there is a strong
reason for so doing.  In some cases the interests of justice necessitate an
immediate decision.  Examples of such necessitous circumstances include cases
in which the trial court itself is implicated in a constitutional violation as
in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, or where substantial on-going
constitutional violations require immediate attention as in R. v. Gamble,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 595.  Moreover, in some cases it will save time to decide
constitutional questions before proceeding to trial on the evidence.  An
apparently meritorious Charter  challenge of the law under which the
accused is charged which is not dependent on facts to be elicited during the
trial may come within this exception to the general rule.  (See Manitoba
(Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110, at p.
133.)  This applies with added force when the trial is expected to be of
considerable duration.  See, for example, R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606.

 

                   In this case no
objection was taken at trial to the procedure adopted by the trial judge.  The Charter 
challenge was not without merit notwithstanding its fate in this Court.  I am
satisfied that the evidence at trial would not have assisted in the resolution
of the constitutional question given the nature of the appellant's
submissions.  The Court of Appeal stated that it was ""purely speculative
at this stage whether the facts at trial will establish a mental element
compatible with criminal and constitutional requirements of blameworthiness for
a finding of guilt under this section"" (p. 96).  The fact that the
appellant's conduct would attract criminal responsibility because the mental
element conforms to constitutional requirements would not resolve the issue if
the section in its other applications criminalized conduct that did not meet
constitutional standards.  We have not adopted the ""constitutional as
applied"" approach that is prevalent in the United States.  See R. v.
Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1078, per Lamer J. (as
he then was), and p. 1113, per Le Dain J.  Accordingly, I conclude that
the trial judge did not err in disposing of the appellant's motion before
hearing evidence.

 

B.  Section 269 of the
Criminal Code

 

                   To be brought
within the ambit of s. 269, an accused must have committed an underlying
unlawful offence (otherwise referred to as the predicate offence) and have
caused bodily harm to another person as a result of committing that underlying
offence.  For liability to be imposed for unlawfully causing bodily harm, the
harm caused must have sufficient causal connection to the underlying offence
committed (see R. v. Wilmot (1940), 74 C.C.C. 1 (Alta. C.A.),
at pp. 17 and 26-27, appeal dismissed for other reasons [1941] S.C.R.
53).  The requirement of an underlying ""unlawful"" offence includes at
its most general, and subject to the restrictions discussed below, only
offences prohibited by federal or provincial legislation.  A similar conclusion
in regard to criminal conspiracy to effect an ""unlawful"" purpose was
reached earlier by this Court in Gralewicz, supra, at
p. 509.

 

                   (1)  The
Mental Element Requirement of Section 269

 

                   The major issue
raised in this appeal concerns the mental element required by s. 269 of
the Code.  After delineating the statutorily required mental element,
the question of the constitutional sufficiency of this element will then be
addressed to determine whether it passes constitutional muster.

 

                   It is axiomatic
that in criminal law there should be no responsibility without personal fault. 
A fault requirement was asserted to be a fundamental aspect of our common law
by this Court in R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
1299, and as a matter of constitutional law under s. 7  of the Charter 
in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  As a
matter of statutory interpretation, a provision should not be interpreted to
lack any element of personal fault unless the statutory language mandates such
an interpretation in clear and unambiguous terms.  Unlike most offences, the
mental element of s. 269  is composed of two separate requirements.  The
first requirement is that the mental element of the underlying offence of
s. 269  be satisfied.  The second requirement is that the additional fault
requirement supplied by the wording of s. 269 , discussed more fully infra,
also be satisfied.

 

                   (a)  The
Mental Element of the Underlying Offence

 

                   To be convicted
under s. 269, the prosecution must first satisfy the mental element
requirement of the underlying offence.  In interpreting the ambit of the
underlying offences covered by s. 269 it is important to recognize the
abhorrence of the criminal law for offences of absolute liability.  While not
all underlying offences will have a possibility of imprisonment and despite the
fact that s. 269 has a fault requirement in addition to that supplied by
the underlying offence, as a matter of statutory interpretation, underlying offences
of absolute liability are excluded from forming the basis for a prosecution
under s. 269.  For the reasons given by this Court in Sault
Ste. Marie, supra, and Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra,
s. 269 should not be interpreted so as to bootstrap underlying offences of
absolute liability into the criminal law.  The criminal law is based on proof
of personal fault and this concept is jealously guarded when a court is asked
to interpret criminal provisions, especially those with potentially serious penal
consequences.  This statutory conclusion is mandated by the general presumption
in the interpretation of criminal statutes against absolute liability and the
absence of clear words to the contrary to rebut this presumption.  Thus, the
concept of ""unlawful"" as it is used in s. 269 does not include
any underlying offence of absolute liability.  The inclusion of such offences
would be contrary to the general canons of criminal interpretation quite apart
from any Charter  considerations (see particularly R. v. Prue,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 547, at p. 553, and Beaver v. The Queen,
[1957] S.C.R. 531, at pp. 537-38 and 542-43).  Although not relying
on constitutional requirements in foreclosing the possibility of absolute
liability offences forming the predicate offences of s. 269 , certainly
principles of fundamental justice require no less.

 

                   In addition to
satisfying the statutorily required mental element of the underlying offence,
the mental element of the underlying offence must also be constitutionally
sufficient in its own right.  If the underlying offence contains a
constitutionally insufficient mental element, it is of no force or effect and
thus cannot form the basis for a prosecution under s. 269.  The underlying
offence must be valid in law on its own before it can be used to support a
charge under s. 269.

 

                   (b)  The
Meaning of ""Unlawful"" in Section 269

 

                   In addition to the
mental element required by the underlying offence, the wording of s. 269,
and particularly the case law interpreting the term ""unlawfully"", imports
an additional aspect to the mental element of s. 269.  The case law
interpreting the use of this term in similar provisions has focused on the
offence most commonly known as unlawful act manslaughter.  While manslaughter
is not the offence at issue in this appeal, the case law which seeks to
interpret the term ""unlawful"" in that context is instructive.

 

                   The leading English
authority on the issue of the meaning of ""unlawful"" in this area is R.
v. Larkin (1942), 29 Cr. App. R. 18, where the Court of Criminal
Appeal held at p. 23 that:

 

Where
the act which a person is engaged in performing is unlawful, then if at the
same time it is a dangerous act, that is, an act which is likely to injure
another person, and quite inadvertently the doer of the act causes the death of
that other person by that act, then he is guilty of manslaughter.

 

English authority has consistently
held that the underlying unlawful act required by its manslaughter offence
requires proof that the unlawful act was ""likely to injure another
person"" or in other words put the bodily integrity of others at risk (see
also R. v. Hall (1961), 45 Cr. App. R. 366 (C.C.A.); R. v.
Church (1965), 49 Cr. App. R. 206 (C.C.A.); Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Newbury (1976), 62 Cr. App. R. 291 (H.L.), and Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Daley (1978), 69 Cr. App. R. 39
(P.C.)).  This position has also been adopted by most Canadian courts.  In R.
v. Adkins (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d) 346, Hutcheon J.A., speaking for the
British Columbia Court of Appeal, indicated that the words ""unlawful
act"" have never been taken literally in the law pertaining to
manslaughter.  He noted that it is not every unlawful act by which death is
caused that can support a finding of culpable homicide.  The act must be one
which meets the test referred to in Larkin, supra.  Other appellate
courts have come to the same conclusion (see R. v. Lelievre (1962), 132
C.C.C. 288 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 295; R. v. Tennant (1975), 23
C.C.C. (2d) 80 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 96; R. v. Kitching (1976), 32
C.C.C. (2d) 159 (Man. C.A.), at pp. 168-69; R. v. Cole (1981),
64 C.C.C. (2d) 119 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 127, leave to appeal denied,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. vii; R. v. Creighton (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 317
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal granted, [1991] 3 S.C.R. vii, and R. v.
Gosset (1991), 6 C.R. (4th) 239 (Que. C.A.), at p. 251 (appeal
heard May 1, 1992, judgment currently reserved)).

 

                   Despite ample
authority that the underlying act must be objectively dangerous in order to
sustain a conviction under what is now s. 222(5) (a), the law in
this area is not entirely free from doubt.  In Smithers v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, Dickson J. (as he then was) adopted certain comments made
by G. Arthur Martin (later Martin J.A.) in a short case note on the
English Larkin case.  The adopted comments included the following:

 

There
are many unlawful acts which are not dangerous in themselves and are not likely
to cause injury which, nevertheless if they cause death, render the actor
guilty of culpable homicide.... 

 

In
the case of so-called intentional crimes where death is an unintended
consequence the actor is always guilty of manslaughter at least.

 

(""Criminal
Law -- Voluntary and Involuntary Manslaughter -- Lawful and Unlawful Acts""
(1943), 21 Can. Bar. Rev. 503, at pp. 504-5; cited in Smithers,
supra, at p. 519.)

 

This passage appears to raise doubt as
to whether the ""unlawful act"" must be inherently dangerous to sustain
a manslaughter conviction.  This issue was not addressed in Smithers,
however, as the assault which occurred in that case was clearly an intentional,
dangerous, act.  As well, Smithers was a case concerned with the issue
of causation and not the meaning to be given to the term ""unlawful
act"".  Finally, Smithers was not argued under the Charter . 
In the absence of a more definitive statement or a more extensive analysis of
the issue, I am reluctant to freeze the meaning of ""unlawful"" for the
purposes of s. 269  based on the 1943 comments of even as persuasive a
source as G. Arthur Martin.  More telling, and also more considered,
authority was provided by Martin J.A. in Tennant, supra, which
predates Smithers but was not discussed by Dickson J. in the latter
decision.  In Tennant, a Court of Appeal panel composed of Gale C.J.O.
and Brooke and Martin JJ.A. rendered a per curiam judgment which
concluded at p. 96 that:

 

When
death is accidentally caused by the commission of an unlawful act which any
reasonable person would inevitably realize must subject another person to, at
least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm, that
is manslaughter.

 

The court later noted that:

 

...
if death was caused by the accidental discharge of the fire-arm in the
commission of such unlawful act and if the jury were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the unlawful act was such as any reasonable person
would inevitably realize must subject another to the risk of, at least, some
harm, albeit not serious harm, the death would amount to manslaughter. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

The court thus substantially adopted
the English position as articulated in Larkin.

 

                   In accordance with
the English law and in furtherance of the developing Canadian case law, the
most principled approach to the meaning of ""unlawful"" in the context
of s. 269 is to require that the unlawful act be at least objectively
dangerous.  This conclusion is both supported by the meaning given to the words
""unlawful act"" by virtually all of the lower courts and also is in
accord with the emerging jurisprudence of this Court in regard to personal
fault.

 

                   Objective foresight
of bodily harm should be required for both criminal and non-criminal unlawful
acts which underlie a s. 269 prosecution.  I can see no reason why there
should be a difference between the two categories of acts.  There is no need to
differentiate between criminal and non-criminal unlawful acts when one unifying
concept is available.  Thus the test is one of objective foresight of bodily
harm for all underlying offences.  The act must be both unlawful, as described
above, and one that is likely to subject another person to danger of
harm or injury.  This bodily harm must be more than merely trivial or
transitory in nature and will in most cases involve an act of violence done
deliberately to another person.  In interpreting what constitutes an
objectively dangerous act, the courts should strive to avoid attaching penal
sanctions to mere inadvertence.  The contention that no dangerousness
requirement is required if the unlawful act is criminal should be rejected. 
The premise on which this proposition is based is that most, if not all,
criminal acts are inherently dangerous.  This premise is an overstatement
inasmuch as a large part of the criminal law is concerned with offences against
property and other interests which are not inherently dangerous.  But, even if
this premise were accepted, the difference between the two positions would be
simply one of semantics.  To maintain the correct focus it is preferable to
inquire whether a reasonable person would inevitably realize that the
underlying unlawful act would subject another person to the risk of bodily harm
rather than getting sidetracked on a question regarding the classification of
the offence.

 

                   (2)  Constitutional
Sufficiency

 

                   The mental element
of s. 269 has two separate aspects.  The first aspect of the mental
element is the requirement that an underlying offence with a constitutionally
sufficient mental element has been committed.  Additionally, s. 269
requires that the prosecution prove that the bodily harm caused by the
underlying unlawful act was objectively foreseeable.  This latter requirement
insures that all prosecutions under s. 269 contain at least a fault
requirement based on an objective standard.  As this Court has not indicated
that fundamental justice requires fault based on a subjective standard for all
offences, the mental element required by s. 269 passes constitutional
muster unless s. 269 is one of those few offences which due to its stigma
and penalty require fault based on a subjective standard.  I agree with the
respondent and interveners that s. 269 has neither the stigma nor criminal
sanction to require a more demanding mental element than it already has.  The
criminal sanction is flexible and thus can be tailored to suit the circumstances
of the case.  The stigma associated with conviction will generally reflect the
degree of opprobrium which the underlying offence attracts.  The stigma
attached to the underlying offence will in turn influence the minimum mental
requirement for that offence.

 

                   Unless a minimum
mind state of subjective intention in regard to consequences is
constitutionally required, the test discussed above satisfies the dictates of
s. 7  of the Charter .  I will now consider that issue.

 

C.  Foresight of
Consequences

 

                   Although I have
concluded by means of statutory interpretation that s. 269 requires
objective foresight of the consequences of an accused's unlawful act, the
appellant argues that s. 7  of the Charter  requires subjective
foresight of all consequences which comprise part of the actus reus of
an offence.  The appellant notes that in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 633, Lamer C.J., speaking for the majority of the Court, discussed
(at p. 645) a:

 

...
general principle that criminal liability for a particular result is not
justified except where the actor possesses a culpable mental state in respect
of that result: ...

 

The appellant also relies on R. v.
Metro News Ltd. (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal
refused, [1986] 2 S.C.R. viii, for a similar proposition that (at pp. 54-55):

 

...
[t]he minimum and necessary mental element required for criminal liability for
most crimes is knowledge of the circumstances which make up the actus reus
of the crime and foresight or intention with respect to any consequence
required to constitute the actus reus of the crime.

 

The appellant submits that this
authority supports a requirement that the minimum mental element required by
s. 7  of the Charter  for s. 269  includes an intention to cause
bodily harm.  In isolation, it is true that the language used in some earlier
decisions of this Court could be interpreted as suggested by the appellant. 
This proposition draws additional support from statements such as those of
Wilson J. in R. v. Docherty, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941, where she infers
that proof of intention is required in regard to each of the elements of
the actus reus.  Wilson J. states (at p. 958):

 

                   A
full mens rea offence under the Criminal Code  demands that the
accused have an intent to perform the acts that constitute the actus reus
of the offence.

 

                   As one of the
elements of the actus reus in this appeal is that bodily harm be
produced, it is arguable that the case law of this Court has implied that
foresight of the consequences of an act must be proved when such consequences
constitute an essential element of the offence.  This argument, however,
misconstrues and overgeneralizes the language used by this Court in these
earlier judgments (see also R. v. Rees, [1956] S.C.R. 640, and Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, at p. 139).  In the
circumstances of Docherty, the offence definition itself required
intention in regard to all aspects of the actus reus and thus this
proposition was not meant to be set down as an overriding principle of criminal
law.  Equally, in Martineau it was only as a result of the stigma and
penal consequences of a murder conviction that subjective foresight of death
was required.  Here again, it was not meant to be stated as a general principle
of criminal law.  As far back as Blackstone's Commentaries, it was recognized
that criminal guilt did not always require foresight of the consequences of an
unlawful act:

 

...
if a man be doing any thing unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he
did not foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his want of
foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty of one offence, in doing
antecedently what is in itself unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever
consequence may follow the first misbehaviour. [Emphasis in original.]

 

(Commentaries
on the Laws of England (1769), Book IV, at p. 27.)

 

                   In R. v. Hess,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, the Court concluded that a meaningful mental element was
required in regard to a blameworthy element of the actus reus. 
Provided that there is a sufficiently blameworthy element in the actus reus
to which a culpable mental state is attached, there is no additional
requirement that any other element of the actus reus be linked to this
mental state or a further culpable mental state.  As inferred by Blackstone, supra,
provided that the actor is already engaged in a culpable activity, foresight of
consequences is not required in order to hold that actor responsible for the
results of his or her unlawful activity.  Lamer C.J. stated in Martineau
that ""[i]f Parliament wishes to deter persons from causing bodily harm
during certain offences, then it should punish persons for causing the bodily
harm"" (p. 647).  This is exactly what s. 269 attempts to do.  In
this particular provision the mental element requirement is composed of both
the mental element of the underlying unlawful act and the additional
requirement of objective foresight of bodily harm.  There is, however, no
constitutional requirement that intention, either on an objective or a
subjective basis, extend to the consequences of unlawful acts in general.

 

                   The absence of a
constitutional requirement that intention extend to all aspects of an unlawful
act was discussed by Wilson J. in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 833, at pp. 888-89, where she concludes that the minimal
element of the application of force is sufficient for a conviction for sexual
assault causing bodily harm.  She inferentially confirms that s. 7  of the Charter 
does not mandate intention in regard to all of the consequences required by the
offence.  The contrary position, that intention must extend to all of the
required consequences of an offence, is not supported by the case law and
should not be adopted as a constitutional requirement.

 

                   There are many provisions
where one need not intend all of the consequences of an action.  As was pointed
out in Hess, supra, there must be an element of personal fault in regard
to a culpable aspect of the actus reus, but not necessarily in regard to
each and every element of the actus reus.  The requirement of fault in
regard to a meaningful aspect of the actus reus is necessary to prevent
punishing the mentally, and morally, innocent and is in keeping with a long
line of cases of this Court including Rees, supra, and Pappajohn,
supra.  In many offences, such as assault or dangerous driving, the offence
is made out regardless of the consequences of the act but the consequences can
be used to aggravate liability for the offence.  For example, both assault and
assault causing bodily harm have identical mens rea requirements and the
element of causing bodily harm is merely used to classify the offence.  No
principle of fundamental justice prevents Parliament from treating crimes with
certain consequences as more serious than crimes which lack those consequences.

 

                   A number of Criminal
Code  offences call for a more serious charge if certain consequences
follow.  To require intention in relation to each and every consequence would
bring a large number of offences into question including manslaughter
(s. 222(5) ), criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221 ),
criminal negligence causing death (s. 220 ), dangerous operation causing
bodily harm (s. 249(3) ), dangerous operation causing death
(s. 249(4) ), impaired driving causing bodily harm (s. 255(2) ),
impaired driving causing death (s. 255(3) ), assault causing bodily harm
(s. 267(1) (b)), aggravated assault (s. 268 ), sexual assault
causing bodily harm (s. 272 (c)), aggravated sexual assault
(s. 273 ), mischief causing danger to life (s. 430(2) ) and arson
causing bodily harm (s. 433 (b)).  As noted by Professor Colvin,
""[i]t would, however, be an error to suppose that actus reus and mens
rea always match in this neat way"" (E. Colvin, Principles of
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 55).

 

                   Conduct may
fortuitously result in more or less serious consequences depending on the
circumstances in which the consequences arise.  The same act of assault may
injure one person but not another.  The implicit rationale of the law in this
area is that it is acceptable to distinguish between criminal responsibility
for equally reprehensible acts on the basis of the harm that is actually
caused.  This is reflected in the creation of higher maximum penalties for
offences with more serious consequences.  Courts and legislators acknowledge
the harm actually caused by concluding that in otherwise equal cases a more
serious consequence will dictate a more serious response.

 

                   There appears to be
a general principle in Canada and elsewhere that, in the absence of an express
legislative direction, the mental element of an offence attaches only to the
underlying offence and not to the aggravating circumstances (Colvin, supra,
at p. 57).  This has been confirmed by this Court in a number of cases
including those which have held that sexual assault requires intention simply
in relation to the assault and not any aggravating circumstance (see R. v.
Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, and R. v. Bernard, supra, at
pp. 888-89).  To require fault in regard to each consequence of an action
in order to establish liability for causing that consequence would
substantially restructure current notions of criminal responsibility.  Such a
result cannot be founded on the constitutional aversion to punishing the
morally innocent.  One is not morally innocent simply because a particular
consequence of an unlawful act was unforeseen by that actor.  In punishing for
unforeseen consequences the law is not punishing the morally innocent but those
who cause injury through avoidable unlawful action.  Neither basic principles
of criminal law, nor the dictates of fundamental justice require, by necessity,
intention in relation to the consequences of an otherwise blameworthy act.

 

Disposition

 

                   On a proper
interpretation of s. 269 of the Code, the concept of an unlawful
act as it is used in that section includes only federal and provincial
offences.  Excluded from this general category of offences are any offences
which are based on absolute liability and which have constitutionally
insufficient mental elements on their own.  Additionally, the term
""unlawfully"", as it is used in this section requires an act which is
at least objectively dangerous.  Interpreted in this way s. 269 complies
with the requirements of s. 7  of the Charter .  In the absence of a
violation of s. 7 , there is no violation of s. 11 (d).  I would
answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 269 of the Criminal Code  violate s. 7  or 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:  No.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is ""yes"", then is s. 269 of the Code
a reasonable limit justified by s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

Answer:  It is not necessary to answer this
question.

 

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. 
In view of the fact that a trial has not been held in this matter, the trial
should proceed on an expedited basis.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: It sometimes happens that a person who has led a blameless life commits a fatal act of violence in the heat of a moment. A human life is taken. The lives of the victim’s loved ones are dealt a blow from which they may never recover. The life of the perpetrator is changed irrevocably. Cases of this kind present the courts with a particularly difficult sentencing exercise. This is such a case.  
     
      
    2 In the early hours of Sunday, 26 July 2009, Judith May Duncan stabbed her partner, Thomas George Chatfield, with a kitchen knife at their home in Moree, inflicting a wound which led to his death. The incident occurred in circumstances which I shall describe shortly. She did not intend to kill him or to cause him serious injury. She was indicted for the murder of Mr Chatfield, but her plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of that indictment. She stands for sentence on the basis that she caused his death by an unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    3 Ms Duncan is an Aboriginal woman, who was 44 years old at the time of the offence and is now 45. She was brought up in the Moree area. She left school before completing year 12. She did a number of courses relating to welfare, and had a commendable employment history in community service. For some years she was employed by the Department of Youth and Community Services, now the Department of Community Services, where she became a District Officer. In more recent years she worked with the Department of Local Government, caring for the aged and people with disabilities. She was highly regarded in the welfare sector. I received statements from a number of her colleagues attesting to her integrity, competence and dedication. 
     
      
    4 Mr Chatfield had been her only partner. Their relationship was longstanding, commencing in the 1980s. They had one child, a son, who is now an adult. During the relationship he had worked intermittently, and she had been the main breadwinner in the household. It seems that he resented her stable employment and professional success. 
     
      
    5 Unfortunately, from a relatively early stage in the relationship he began to abuse her, physically and emotionally. This was by no means a daily occurrence. It was sporadic but it persisted throughout the relationship. There is no need to dilate upon it. I accept Ms Duncan’s evidence about it, which is supported by the statements of her son and her work colleagues. There were episodes of physical violence, some of which appear to have been fairly severe. There were also episodes of abusive and threatening behaviour, which she found more frightening than the violence. She said in evidence, “It got to the stage in the long run … he would just have to raise his voice and I would be looking for somewhere to hide.”  
     
      
    6 Sometimes he came to her workplace and abused her there. On one of those occasions the manager at her office called the police, because he was concerned for her safety and that of the other employees. Over the years, particularly in the year leading up to the fatal incident, he accused her of being unfaithful to him. These accusations were unfounded. In that last year the physical and verbal abuse increased, and she became depressed. 
     
      
    7 Throughout all this, as is so often the case, she did not seek the intervention of the law. Nor did she seek professional assistance, even though she worked in an area where it was readily available. Over the years she herself had assisted people who were the victims of domestic violence, and from time to time she had told her colleagues about Mr Chatfield’s behaviour. Nevertheless, the effect of her evidence was that she did not wish it to be known within her community that she lived in an abusive relationship. She felt that she was perceived as a role model within that community and, as she put it, “I wouldn’t be seen as a very good role model if I couldn’t be seen handling my own situation, in trying to help other people get their lives together and support them.”  
     
      
    8 Her evidence about this pattern of abuse was impressive in its frankness. She described it in a composed manner. Her account was clearly not exaggerated, and at no stage did she seek to portray herself as the frail and helpless victim of a cruel and violent man. Indeed, asked in cross-examination to describe the relationship just before the fatal incident, she said that it was “very volatile”, adding that they were “both very headstrong …”.  
     
      
    9 It is against this background that the offence must be understood. Ms Duncan and Mr Chatfield had been invited to a party on the night of Saturday, 25 July 2009. Mr Chatfield went to the party, but she was tired and stayed at home. He returned to the home at about 9.00pm and asked her to join him at the party, but she refused. She went to bed at about 11.00pm.  
     
      
    10 At about 2.30 the following morning he woke her. He was drunk and angry. He called her a “slut” and a “moll”, and pushed her off the bed. She landed on the floor on all fours. He told her to get out of the bedroom because she was not sleeping in the bed that night. 
     
      
    11 Apparently, he had heard a message received on her mobile phone at around that time, and believed it to be from someone with whom she was having a liaison. He demanded to know who had been ringing and said to her, “Who are you running around with?” It transpired that the message had been left by a male cousin of hers, who was managing a local hotel and was finishing work at the time. He was ringing to see if she and Mr Chatfield were still awake, so that he could come around and have a drink with them. 
     
      
    12 She got dressed and left the bedroom, intending to sit in the lounge room and watch television. He intercepted her in the hallway and pushed her, again causing her to fall to the floor. Apparently, this was at a point very close to the kitchen. He stepped over her, she thought that he was going to continue to assault her, and she seized a knife from the kitchen and stabbed him once in the abdomen. She then looked for somewhere to hide, fearing that he would come after her.  
     
      
    13 She went outside the house but came back in, to find him lying on the lounge room floor. It appears that it was only then that she realised that he was badly hurt. She rang her son, who was also at a party in the area. In a voice which he described as “scared and panicked”, she said, “I stabbed your father”. The son drove home. Mr Chatfield was still conscious and said to him, “Son, help me.” Ms Duncan said, “I’m so sorry, son.” Mr Chatfield called to her, and she knelt next to him, held his hand, and repeatedly said that she was sorry.  
     
      
    14 Both she and her son called the triple-0 emergency line. I have heard a recording of her call, in which she reported having stabbed Mr Chatfield in the stomach once. She was clearly distraught and was pleading for help. 
     
      
    15 When police arrived, she again admitted having stabbed Mr Chatfield. Asked by Senior Constable Cusack what had happened, she said, “He kicked me out of bed and I grabbed some pillows because I knew I’d be sleeping alone and then he was sort of pushing me down the hallway and I fell, and then I grabbed a fuckin, … I suppose that’s it for my job.” That last observation seems inappropriate, indeed rather callous, in the circumstances. However, in the light of the clear evidence of her distress and remorse over what she had done, I place no significance on it. 
     
      
    16 Senior Constable Cusack also heard her say, “I suppose it seems pretty cold but I’ve just been putting up with this for so long.” Some friends of her son arrived, and to one of them she said, “Me and George had a row … it was over a text message.” Mr Chatfield was generally referred to as “George”. To another person she said, “I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it.” 
     
      
    17 He was conveyed by ambulance to Moree Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He died shortly thereafter. A post-mortem examination conducted the following day determined that the cause of death was haemorrhage due to a stab injury to the abdomen.  
     
      
    18 Even though the ambulance station was very close to the home where Mr Chatfield and Ms Duncan lived, an ambulance did not arrive until about 15 minutes after the triple-0 notification. An Ambulance Service incident report which is in evidence discloses that the call was classified as “non-emergency”. Why that is so is unexplained. It may be because Mr Chatfield was still conscious, and could be heard speaking in the background, and the operator may not have realised how serious his injury was. Moreover, the ambulance crew on duty at the time was involved in a task out of Moree, and the officers who attended had to be recalled to duty from their homes. It also appears from the post-mortem report that an injury to Mr Chatfield’s left renal vein was not identified at surgery. Whether Mr Chatfield might have lived if ambulance officers had attended the home sooner, or if surgery had been more effective, I cannot say.  
     
      
    19 Ms Duncan was arrested on the day of the offence, 26 July 2009, and has been in custody since. Her sentence will be backdated to that day.  
     
      
    20 I have regard to the evidence of Mr Chatfield’s abusive and violent behaviour towards her because, obviously, it is relevant to an assessment of the gravity of her crime. I have no evidence of his background, in which an explanation of his behaviour might be found. It is no part of my function to pass judgment upon him, and I would not presume to do so. His good qualities are apparent from victim impact statements I received from his parents, his sister and his son. These were moving testaments to their love of him, their grief and outrage at his untimely death, and the enduring effects this tragedy has had upon their lives. I expressed my deepest sympathy to them during the sentence proceedings, and I do so again now. I can but hope that the conclusion of these proceedings will be a small step towards their coming to terms with their loss, but I am well aware that no sentence I pass could relieve their pain.  
     
      
    21 There is no doubt that Ms Duncan is deeply remorseful for her crime. So much is apparent from her behaviour that morning. Before me, she expressed her remorse in no uncertain terms in evidence. She described the offence and the background to it in the composed manner to which I have referred. In fact, it appeared to me that she was making every effort to keep her emotion under control. However, when asked by her counsel, Mr Stratton SC, how she felt about Mr Chatfield, she broke down and sobbed. Through tears, she uttered one of the most sincere and abject apologies I have ever heard. Among other things, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I love him and I miss him and I am sorry for what has happened. I am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life …, it makes my heart ache knowing what I have done and I would like to say to them for their son, no-one wants to lose their children before their time. … there’s not a day since this happened that George hasn’t been on my mind. … it’s very hard not to be thinking about him. I wanted to grow old with the man. I love him. We had our problems … . There is not a day that I don’t pray for everyone involved with this.” 
        
       
      
    22 To say that Ms Duncan has led a blameless life is not to suggest that her background is entirely unblemished. She has two previous convictions, both of them for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol, in 2001 and 2002 respectively. On one of those occasions she had driven from the home to get away from Mr Chatfield after he had assaulted her. This minor criminal history is of no significance for present purposes.  
     
      
    23 By her own account, she appears to have been a fairly heavy drinker, and she regularly used cannabis. She was assessed for the purpose of sentence by the well known forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, who provided a report. He concluded that at the time of the offence she was suffering from substance use disorder and depressive illness. However, at the time he interviewed her in custody in August of this year, he considered the substance use disorder to be in remission and the depressive illness to be in partial remission. 
     
      
    24 While in custody she has been an Aboriginal delegate, which is a position of some trust. Her task is to act as a liaison between new Aboriginal inmates and the prison authorities, helping them adjust to their custodial status and ensuring that they have access to appropriate services. She herself has undertaken counselling courses in self management and recovery, and grief and loss.  
     
      
    25 Clearly, she has excellent prospects of rehabilitation. It is apparent from the testimonials I have received as to her character that she has support within the Moree community. In his report Dr Nielssen made some observations about her which I would endorse: 
     
      
       
        
        “She has reached an age of relative maturity with no major criminal convictions and without pursuing an unproductive or anti-social lifestyle. She has been employed in responsible positions in the caring professions for most of her adult life … . She has addressed her substance abuse disorder … . She does not have a psychiatric disorder that would predict further irrational or self defeating behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    26 That said, she would benefit from a reasonable period of supervised liberty upon her release to help her reintegrate into society. This is her first experience of imprisonment and, as she realistically pointed out in evidence, because of her conviction it is unlikely that she has any prospect of returning to employment in the government welfare sector. Accordingly, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    27 Manslaughter is an inherently serious offence, whatever the circumstances of the particular case, because it involves the unlawful taking of a human life. Nevertheless, the crime involves a very wide spectrum of criminality and it is necessary to examine the circumstances of each case to determine where it falls within that spectrum. Ms Duncan’s offence is clearly low in the scale of culpability. She killed Mr Chatfield by a single blow to the stomach with a knife. As I have said, she did not intend to kill him or to cause him serious injury. While the basis of manslaughter in her case is not excessive self defence or provocation, there are elements of both in her arming herself with the knife and striking as she did. She acted quickly and impulsively in the heat of a violent incident which, as Mr Stratton put it, was not of her choosing.  
     
      
    28 I am indebted to Mr Stratton and the Crown prosector for their reference to a number of manslaughter sentence cases, but they are of little assistance. To say that every case turns on its own facts is not to deny that some guidance might be obtained by examination of other broadly similar cases. It is unnecessary to go to the detail of the cases to which I have been referred. While at a superficial level they share some of the features of the present case, a closer examination discloses that the similarities are greatly outweighed by the differences.  
     
      
    29 It is appropriate that I record what those cases are. Three are decisions at first instance: R v Kennedy [2000] NSWSC 109 (Barr J), R v Melrose [2001] NSWSC 847 (McClellan J, as he then was) and R v Jukes [2006] NSWSC 1065 (Hoeben J). The remaining three are decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Edwards (1997) 90 A Crim R 510, Stephenson v R [2008] NSWCCA 266 and Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40. Two of them were cases in which a woman killed a violent and abusive partner: Kennedy and Melrose. Both were particularly distressing cases, in which the offender had been the victim of persistent and very severe abuse. Each of them was placed on a 4 year good behaviour bond.  
     
      
    30 I do not consider a non-custodial sentence to be appropriate in the present case, and Mr Stratton did not suggest that it was. Nevertheless, Ms Duncan is entitled to a marked degree of leniency. The circumstances of her offence speak for themselves. It was committed by a mature, responsible and caring woman who, I am confident, will never re-offend and who will have to endure the burden of her guilt for the rest of her life. I propose to fashion a sentence which will enable her release in the near future.  
     
      
    31 But for her plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of 3 ½ years. I shall reduce that term by 15% on account of the plea, producing in round figures a sentence of 3 years. I shall specify a non-parole period of 16 months. The sentence will commence on 26 July 2009. She will be released on parole on 25 November 2010, and her sentence will expire on 25 July 2012. 
     
      
    32 Judith May Duncan, for the manslaughter of Thomas George Chatfield you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, commencing on 26 July 2009 and expiring on 25 November 2010, and a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months, commencing on 26 November 2010 and expiring on 25 July 2012. I direct that you be released on parole on 25 November 2010.

	HOEBEN CJ AT CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   On 19 August 2013 the Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of having sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he was in the company of Donna O’Neill at the time, contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 12 years.
	
	
	On 7 March 2014 he was sentenced by Judge Maiden in the District Court to a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 January 2018 with an additional term of one year, four months and six days expiring on 27 May 2019.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on two grounds as follows:
	


1.   The Sentencing Judge erred in the finding relating to the objective seriousness of the offence.

2.   The Sentencing Judge erred in setting the non-parole period.

The facts


	
	There was an Agreed Statement of Facts at the sentencing hearing. The following facts are largely taken from the Sentencing Judge’s summary of those facts.
	
	
	On 19 February 2011 the complainant, who was then aged 15 years, had been asked to baby sit the children of the Applicant and his partner (the co-offender). The complainant was the daughter of friends of the Applicant and the co-offender, and there was a close relationship between the families of the complainant and the Applicant. The complainant had been the regular baby sitter for the Applicant and the co-offender.
	
	
	The Applicant and the co-offender had made an arrangement before the services of the complainant had been engaged to socialise that night at a local club. During that afternoon, the Applicant directed the co-offender to text the complainant with these words, ""Kenny wants to know if you would like to have a threesome tonight."" The complainant responded, ""Tell him no"". The Sentencing Judge concluded from the Agreed Facts that it may have been contemplated by the Applicant that despite the complainant's young age she would be provided with alcohol so that she may have been intoxicated and thus open to his suggestions.
	
	
	The complainant cared for the children during the evening, including bathing them and putting them to bed. The Applicant and the co-offender arrived home shortly after 1am. The complainant was still awake and was handed money for the baby sitting.
	
	
	After having a shower the Applicant went into the lounge where he had an argument with the co-offender. He then approached the complainant and said, ""If you don't have sex with me I'll hit Donna (meaning the co-offender) and you"". At that time the complainant walked into the bedroom of the Applicant and the co-offender because of her fear of a physical assault by him.
	
	
	In the bedroom the Applicant took off the complainant's clothing. The co-offender started kissing the complainant. The Applicant told the co-offender to take the complainant’s bra off, and she did so. The Agreed Facts then say this:
	


The offender asked the co-offender to start “doing stuff” to the victim but she replied, “No”.

This statement was interpreted by the Sentencing Judge in a particular way that becomes relevant for the first ground of appeal. I will return to it when discussing that ground.


	
	The Applicant then began kissing the co-offender and fondling her. He then kissed the complainant and put his hands down her underwear and then said, ""Oh, let's take these off."" He pulled the remaining clothing off the complainant and then inserted two of his fingers inside her vagina and moved them around inside of her. He then commenced to have penile vaginal intercourse with the co-offender and was kissing the complainant on the mouth and sucking her breasts whilst doing this. The co-offender also kissed the complainant as well as the Applicant. The co-offender also sucked the complainant’s breasts.
	
	
	The complainant attempted to move her body away and look away from both of them but during this time she was pulled back towards the Applicant. The Sentencing Judge commented at this point that it was clear at this time that the complainant was in fear for herself and what was happening to her. His Honour said that it was difficult to imagine the distress that she must have been suffering and attempting to endure.
	
	
	After ten minutes the Applicant took his penis out of the co-offender’s vagina and the co-offender performed fellatio on him. The Applicant then put his penis inside the complainant's vagina and commenced having sexual intercourse with her. The co-offender left the bedroom and went to the toilet. When she returned she said to the Applicant, “I thought you’d be done by now”, to which he replied, “No”. Shortly thereafter the Applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with the co-offender, and then again had penile/ vaginal sex with the complainant.
	
	
	After another matter of minutes, the co-offender re-entered the bedroom, lay on the bed and turned the television on. At this point the Applicant ejaculated inside the complainant’s vagina. The co-offender asked him words to the effect, ""Where did it go?"" and the Applicant replied, ""In [the complainant]"". The co-offender said, “Well, you better hope the pill works and she doesn’t get pregnant.” He said, “No, she won’t”. The Sentencing Judge observed at this point that the sex at this time was unprotected and there was no doubt that on this second occasion of penile vaginal intercourse that the Applicant had no regard for the safety and welfare of the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant left the room and went to sleep in one of the Applicant’s children's rooms. She was followed by the Applicant who asked her, in an abrupt way, if she wanted to have sex again. The complainant told him to go away, which he did.
	
	
	The next day the co-offender said to the complainant (the Applicant was not present), “Would you like to do it again?” to which the complainant replied, “Don’t ever mention it to me again”. The Sentencing Judge said that this highlighted the distress that the complainant had suffered and was suffering at that time.
	
	
	On 14 March 2011 the complainant made complaint to her mother and to the police.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the matter at the highest end of the range for such offences. By reason of the submissions made on behalf of the Applicant in respect of ground 1 it is necessary to set out exactly what his Honour said in that regard. He said:
	


In terms of the objective seriousness of this matter, the court is of the view that this must be at the highest end of the range for such offences. Section 66C(4) carries a maximum term of 12 years imprisonment. It is a statutory offence which mirrors other sexual matters where the complainant/victims are of different age, that is under 14 years. In those involving victims of a younger age, there is an increased penalty.

It should be borne in mind that in respect of the offence of aggravated indecent assault, section 66M(2) [scil. 61M(2)] of the Crimes Act, that particular offence carries a maximum sentence of ten years and parliament has recommended that there be a standard non-parole period of eight years. There is no such standard non-parole period here.

In respect of this matter there were, in the court's finding, a number of actions by this offender that amounted to indecent assaults, for which he was not charged, those matters being part of the overall criminal offending which involved penile vaginal sex.

The authorities, of which there are relatively few, have involved ordinarily cases where the offender is well known to the child. Often they are matters involving the step-father and/or another male person with a young female where there is a degree of affection which results in sexual behaviour between the victim and the person involved. Cases such as EIP v R [2011] NSWCCA 224 are matters involving that sort of case and what, in the finding of this court, severs this case or differentiates this case from that case is that this was a matter which involved a threat to the complainant initially, where the behaviour continued for a lengthy period of time, notwithstanding it was part of the one overall event and it was done in terms of what might be seen by a reasonable member of the public in circumstances of perversion, that is of two adults having or one of their number having sex with a minor, involving fellatio and other acts during the time that the incident occurred.


	
	His Honour then went on to consider the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. His Honour noted that he was then aged 29, that he was in a de facto relationship with the co-offender and that they had three children together. The Applicant was employed and had no prior criminal record.
	
	
	His Honour referred to a pre-sentence report from Ms Lauren Sanders which recorded that the Applicant said that he was unable to recall what had occurred on the day in question because of his intoxication. He blamed his behaviour on his consumption of alcohol. His Honour did not accept that explanation. In that regard his Honour drew attention to the planning that was involved in the text message.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant did not have any understanding of his actions and the damage it had caused to the complainant. His Honour noted the terms of the Victim Impact Statement from the complainant.
	
	
	By reason of the Applicant having no criminal record, having work experience, his relationship with his wife and children, and that he was previously well thought of by others, his Honour found special circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour found as a result of Ms Sanders’ report that the Applicant was at low to moderate risk of offending. However, his Honour was unable to assess whether or not the incident was what might be described as a “once only” matter.
	
	
	His Honour found that there was a need for general deterrence as well as specific deterrence.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour noted that the evidence showed that the Applicant suffered from no disability nor any intellectual or psychological defect that could give any explanation for his offending behaviour. That left his Honour with the view that what was done was done purely for his sexual gratification.
	


Ground 1:   Objective seriousness


	
	The Applicant submitted that in assessing objective seriousness the Sentencing Judge took into account irrelevant considerations. These considerations were the uncharged offences of aggravated indecent assault and the taking into account of a more serious offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the offence under s 66C(4) does not include an element of lack of consent or knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. If an offence under that section is committed in circumstances of lack of consent and knowledge that the complainant is not consenting it gives rise to the more serious offence under s 61J where the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The Applicant submitted that by his Honour finding the Applicant had committed offences of aggravated indecent assault it was implicit that he considered that the complainant was not consenting and that the acts occurred in circumstances where the Applicant knew she was not consenting. Similarly, the Applicant submitted that his Honour found that the fondling occurred in circumstances where the Judge found that the complainant was not consenting and the Applicant knew she was not consenting.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to the fact that the Sentencing Judge referred to how the complainant was in fear for herself and what was happening to her. The Sentencing Judge also said that the offence involved a threat initially to her.
	
	
	From these matters it was submitted that the Sentencing Judge was dealing with the sexual intercourse on the basis of a more serious offence under s 61J. In that way the assessment of objective seriousness was arrived at erroneously.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge’s reference to the indecent assaults was relevant to how the offence was committed in company. By referring to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the offence of indecent assault, the Sentencing Judge was explaining the seriousness of some of the other sexual activity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge did not expressly find that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse with the Applicant although his Honour erroneously included that the complainant showed her reluctance to engage in sexual activity with the co-offender. This was the matter referred to at [11] above. The Crown submitted that when the Sentencing Judge determined the objective seriousness at the highest end his Honour said that the initial threat to the complainant amongst other factors differentiated the case from one where there was a “degree of affection” between an offender and a complainant.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that if the totality of the remarks by the Sentencing Judge meant that, in effect, he concluded that the complainant was not consenting, his Honour was entitled to rely on that conclusion so long as his Honour did not also make a finding that the Applicant knew the complainant was not consenting in terms of s 61HA(3) of the Crimes Act. Reference was made to Hogan v R [2008] NSWCCA 150.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that had his Honour sentenced the Applicant for an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act the starting point would have been much higher than a term of six years and six months, his Honour’s starting point for the sentence he imposed. Not the least reason for that was that the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 61J is ten years.
	
	
	In Bakewell v R (Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 June 1996, unrep.) the applicant had been charged with an offence under s 61J arising out of sexual intercourse he had engaged in with a 13 year old girl. An arrangement appeared to have been reached and the charge under s 61J was withdrawn with the applicant pleading guilty to an offence under s 66C. The applicant submitted on the appeal that the sentencing judge fell into error by taking into account as an aggravating feature of the s 66C offence the fact that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse and that the intercourse occurred in circumstances of the use of force.
	
	
	The sentencing judge based his remarks and findings on the content of a statement of the complainant, the content of which was not in dispute. The transcript at the sentencing hearing disclosed that the sentencing judge was alerted to the fact that the applicant was charged with the lesser offence under s 66C and that the element of consent was immaterial.
	
	
	Justice Studdert (with whom Gleeson CJ and McInerney J agreed) said (at p.7):
	


His Honour’s task was a difficult one requiring considerable care not to take into account material that converted the offence charged with (sic) the more serious one under s 61J. That the Judge recited the facts such as would have supported the more serious offence does not necessarily constitute error, and indeed it seems to me that it was proper that he should recite the facts correctly. It does not follow from such recital that his Honour sentenced the applicant by reference to the additional elements of the aggravated offence contemplated by s 61J. The Judge did not say he was taking into account, in fixing a sentence, those aggravating elements.


	
	Ultimately, the appeal in that case was upheld only because the sentencing judge had placed before him a psychological appraisal of the complainant that assessed her on the basis that the intercourse had not been consensual.
	
	
	In Hogan v R the appellant appealed (inter alia) against the sentence imposed on him in respect of his conviction of an offence contrary to s 66C. One ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in sentencing the appellant by taking into account the complainant’s lack of consent as being relevant to sentencing in circumstances where, by doing so, that factor would have rendered him liable for a more serious offence contrary to the principles in De Simoni.
	
	
	The sentencing judge in that case said in her remarks on sentence:
	


A submission was made by Mr Hancock, [the appellant’s] counsel, that I ought not take into account in considering the factual circumstances and the objective seriousness of this offence because consent is not an element of this offence. But I think that the factual circumstances of the offence, particularly given the range of offences which can be covered by this offence can be taken into account. For example this offence could cover a situation where two teenagers close in age had consensual sexual intercourse. And I think that that situation is to be distinguished from the situation here which was that [TD] was fourteen years old, [the appellant] was, at that stage, twenty-nine years old, she was affected by alcohol and she was not a willing participant in the act which occurred.


	
	The appellant in that case contended that by taking the complainant’s lack of consent into account the court was in effect sentencing him for an offence against s 61J.
	
	
	Justice Beazley (with whom Johnson and McCallum JJ agreed) said:
	


[77]   In my opinion, her Honour has not offended the principle stated in De Simoni. In the first place, she was conscious that consent was not an element of the offence. Indeed, that had been a matter of submission to her Honour. Rather, it is apparent that her Honour considered the question of whether or not TD was a willing participant was relevant, having regard to the wide range of offences that may be covered by the section. It is also apparent that her Honour’s reference to TD not being a “willing participant” was made so as to gauge the relative seriousness of the offence in this case, as against other offences which might be charged under the section.


	
	In the present matter the Sentencing Judge made two and possibly three references to matters that related to the complainant’s lack of consent to the sexual activity described. One was the threat initially made by the Applicant to the complainant set out at [10] above. The second finding is set out in the first sentence in [13] above.
	
	
	The third is arguably what appears at [11] above. The Sentencing Judge summarised this aspect of the matter in this way:
	


In the bedroom the offender took off the complainant's clothing and there was what might be described as fondling initially and during the initial fondling, which would have amounted to an indecent assault, the complainant said the word ""No"".


	
	The statement in the Agreed Facts is set out at [11] above. The Applicant submitted that his Honour correctly understood the Agreed Facts as saying that it was the complainant who said “no”. That was supported from the surrounding facts which showed that the co-offender continued to participate in the sexual activity.
	
	
	I accept that the Agreed Facts are somewhat ambiguous, but it is not necessary to reach a final view on who said “no” to the Applicant. I do not consider the finding by the Sentencing Judge, if properly made, advances the submissions of the Applicant that his Honour has assessed the objective seriousness for some offence other than the one charged. Even if all of those references disclose that the complainant was not consenting to what took place, I do not consider that error has been shown by the Sentencing Judge’s references to those matters. The matter is not distinguishable from the way the sentencing judges had dealt with the matter in Bakewell and Hogan.
	
	
	It was necessary for the Sentencing Judge to set out all of the details surrounding the offending so that a proper assessment of the objective seriousness could be made. There were two acts of penile/vaginal intercourse and one act of digital/vaginal intercourse. There was no particularisation of which act constituted the offence. Whether the complainant was a willing participant, notwithstanding her age, was relevant, as Hogan makes clear, to the level of objective seriousness.
	
	
	A reading of the Remarks on Sentence as a whole leaves me in no doubt that the Sentencing Judge was aware that he was sentencing in respect of an offence against s 66C and not an offence either contrary to s 61J or s 61M. His Honour contrasted offences under s 66C with the offence of aggravated indecent assault under s 61M. He referred to the different maximum penalty and to the fact that the offence under s 61M carried a standard non-parole period of eight years whereas there was no such standard non-parole period under s 66C. His Honour made reference also to the fact that a number of the actions of the Applicant amounted to indecent assaults “for which he was not charged”. However, his Honour understood those matters as being part of the overall criminal offending.
	
	
	Nowhere does his Honour say or imply that the surrounding facts elevated the offence to one contrary to s 61J or s 61M. His Honour was, however, entitled and required to have regard to them for assessing the objective seriousness of the offending against s 66C.
	
	
	Had his Honour been sentencing under s 61J, as the Applicant submitted, it would have been necessary for his Honour to identify not only a lack of consent on the part of the Complainant but also knowledge on the part of the Applicant that the Complainant was not consenting. The Applicant submitted that his Honour went further than finding no consent and found that the Applicant must have known the complainant was not consenting. The Agreed Facts are silent about the matter. His Honour does not say anything about the Applicant’s knowledge or belief in that regard despite mentioning the matters relating to the Complainant’s lack of consent.
	
	
	Further, I accept the Crown’s submission that if his Honour had in fact been sentencing for an offence against s 61J a starting point of six years and six months for the whole sentence in the face of a standard non-parole period of ten years, even on a plea of guilty, would have needed some justification in the Remarks.
	
	
	In my opinion, this ground is not made out.
	


Ground 2:   The non-parole period


	
	The Sentencing Judge said that in his view the matter should carry a head sentence of six years and six months. From that period he discounted the sentence by 10% for a late plea of guilty which left the sentence at five years, ten months and six days. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances because the Applicant was a person with no record, had work experience, was in a relationship with his partner to whom he had children and was previously thought of well by others.
	
	
	His Honour then said:
	


Having found special circumstances, there is to be a non-parole period of four years and six months.


	
	Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that the balance of the term of a sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless the court decides that there are special circumstances. The non-parole period in the present case was 77% leaving the balance of the term at 23%.
	
	
	It seems clear that this was an error by the Sentencing Judge. As the Crown submitted, it could reasonably be expected that if his Honour had intended to shorten the balance of term when compared to the standard ratio period he would have explained why he had done so: R v Lupton [2003] NSWCCA 200 and R v So [2004] NSWCCA 362. It is clear that his Honour intended to provide for a longer parole period. The Crown accepted that this was so.
	
	
	I would uphold ground 2.
	


Re-sentence


	
	In the circumstances, this Court is required to exercise its independent sentencing discretion when it re-sentences the Applicant: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [43].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the available material to justify any adjustment to the non-parole period. However, the Crown conceded at the sentencing proceedings that it could not disagree with the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Applicant pointed to a number of matters including the fact that this was the Applicant’s first time in custody, that there was a need for an extended period on parole to assist his rehabilitation for problems associated with alcohol, and because he was said to be on protection in custody because of the nature of the offence charged. The Applicant relied on the combination of these matters.
	
	
	The only evidence concerning the custodial arrangements for the Applicant was contained in an affidavit tendered at the hearing of the appeal by the Solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions. That affidavit annexed a letter from the Manager of Security at Kirkconnell Correctional Centre where the Applicant is held. The letter disclosed that the Applicant was housed in the compound area of the Correctional Centre in unit style accommodation mixing with the rest of the population. He was enrolled to do certain courses in the Correctional Centre. There was nothing to indicate any restrictions as a result of the custodial arrangements.
	
	
	In my opinion, the highest special circumstances can be put is that this is the Applicant’s first time in custody and the pre-sentence report lists as one of his criminogenic needs, alcohol/drug problems. The report went on to say that the Applicant would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections including referral for sex offender related programs and treatment, and referral for alcohol related counselling/programs and/or treatment.
	
	
	In the event that only ground 2 was upheld, the Applicant did not contend that there should be any variation to the head sentence. In my opinion, an appropriate adjustment of the statutory ratio is to provide for a non-parole period of four years and one month being 70% of the overall sentence.
	
	
	Finally, it is necessary to say something about the selection by the Sentencing Judge of an overall sentence that referred to a period of six days in addition to the years and months specified. This Court has said more than once that it is inappropriate to provide for a sentence in that form. Where the application of some discount produces such a result the sentence should ordinarily be rounded up or down to the nearest month as is appropriate.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal upheld.

(3)   Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Maiden in the District Court on 7 March 2014. In lieu thereof sentence the Appellant to a non-parole period of four years and one month commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 August 2017 with an additional term of one year nine months expiring 21 May 2019.

The following written judgments were delivered:—



               May 6
               Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.
               
The applicant, Michael Jiminez, seeks special leave to appeal against his conviction of culpable driving for which he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention.
               
At about 11.00 p.m. on 13 June 1988, the applicant set out to travel south in his B.M.W. sedan from the Gold Coast in Queensland to Sydney in New South Wales. He was accompanied by three female companions, one of whom was Janelle May Stephanoni. Before setting out the applicant slept for four hours from about five o'clock in the afternoon. Stephanoni first drove the car for about 400 kilometres during which time the applicant slept. At about 3.30 a.m. on 14 June 1988, the applicant took over the driving of the car. At about 6.00 a.m. at Eungai Creek on the Pacific Highway approximately 30 kilometres north of Kempsey, the car failed to take a moderate right-hand curve in the highway. It travelled on to the eastern gravel shoulder, continued on and collided with a tree and then with two other trees. Stephanoni, who was sitting in the front passenger seat and not wearing a seat-belt, was killed. The other two passengers were in the rear seat.
               
At the scene of the accident there were four wheel marks commencing on the eastern gravel shoulder and extending south for some thirty-seven metres. The marks ended at the base of the first tree. About ten metres south of this tree were the two other trees against which the car had come to rest. There were patches of fog in the low-lying areas along the highway.
               
The applicant was taken to a local hospital where he was treated. Subsequently he was taken to the home of a Salvation Army minister who had attended the scene of the accident and he slept for some three to four hours.
               
A police constable, who also attended the scene of the accident, asked the applicant what had happened. He replied: ""I went to sleep."" Subsequently a record of interview with the applicant was made which contained the following questions and answers:
                     

                        
Q. How did the collision occur?

                        
                        
A. I really don't know. Before the accident there was a lot of fogs in the road, I lost control of the car. Everybody was asleep, the three girls and then it happened. I [sic] was just for a second. I lost control when I fell asleep. I'm not sure what happened.

                        
                        
Q. What is the last thing you remember before losing control?

                        
                        
A. I was in the road the last thing I remember. Before the accident I was going down a hill. The road goes around to the right and then I lost control of the car. I hit the tree.

                        
                        
Q. What speed were you travelling at immediately prior to losing control of the car?

                        
                        
A. Between 80 and 90 kms.

                        
                        
                        
Q. In answer to Q.29 [the first question quoted above] you said in part, I lost control when I fell asleep, were you feeling tired prior to the collision?

                        
                        
A. I don't know what happened, I was driving, I was thinking about stopping in the next town. The heater was on.

                        
                        
                        
Q. What caused your vehicle to run off the road?

                        
                        
A. I don't know why, I just lost control.

                        
                     

                  

               

               
At the hospital the applicant was asked what happened by another policeman. He replied:Janelle drove from the Gold Coast. She drove for about 400 kms. I took over driving around Coffs Harbour somewhere. I think I was travelling around a right hand curve and on to a straight section of road. I think I was travelling 80 to 100 kph. I think I must have gone to sleep. I woke up and the car was out of control to the left side of the road. I tried to control the car but I think I hit a tree.
               

               
In an unsworn statement at his trial the applicant said that at the time of the accident he intended to stop at the next main town for breakfast and that he did not feel like sleeping at all. He continued:Suddenly my car was off the road. I think I must have closed my eyes for a second. When I opened my eyes the car was off the road and I lost control.
               

               
The offence of culpable driving is created by s. 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 
                  N.S.W. and is relevantly as follows:
                     

                        
(1) Where the death of  any person is occasioned through:
                              
(a) the impact with any object of a motor vehicle in or on which that person was being conveyed (whether as a passenger or otherwise);

                              
                              
                           
and the motor vehicle was at the time of the impact  being driven by another person:
                              
                              
(f) at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public, the person who was so driving the motor vehicle shall be guilty of the misdemeanour of culpable driving.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
                        
(3) It shall be a defence to any charge under this section that the death  was not in any way attributable  to the speed at which or the manner in which the vehicle was driven.

                        
                     

                  
The only feature of the applicant's driving that is said to bring it within s. 52A is that, on the evidence, it was open to a jury to conclude that he was, while driving the car, tired and drowsy and had fallen asleep.
               
If the applicant did fall asleep, even momentarily, it is clear that while he was asleep his actions were not conscious or voluntary (an act committed while unconscious is necessarily involuntary) and he could not be criminally responsible for driving the car in a manner dangerous to the public. The offence of culpable driving is, in this respect, no different to any other offence and requires the driving, which is part of the offence, to be a conscious and voluntary act 
    [1]
  .



                        
R. v. Coventry (1938), 59 C.L.R. 633, at p. 638.


               
Upon the evidence, it appears that there was a short period of time after the applicant fell asleep and before the impact during which the applicant awoke and attempted to regain control of the car. It was not suggested that, while he was attempting to regain control, the applicant was driving dangerously. Drivers are often confronted with an emergency which requires them to take steps to avoid an accident. Even if the evasive action fails to avoid the accident it does not necessarily amount to driving in a dangerous manner 
    [2]
  .



                         (1938) 59 C.L.R., at p. 638; see also Simpson v. Peat , [1952] 2 Q.B. 24, at p. 28.


               
The offence of culpable driving as it applies in the present case requires a motor vehicle to have been driven in a manner dangerous to the public at the time of the impact which occasioned death. Even if the motor vehicle was not being driven dangerously at the precise moment of impact, a preceding period of driving in a dangerous manner may be so nearly contemporaneous with the impact as to satisfy this element of the offence. Contemporaneity is a question for the jury 
    [3]
  .


See McBride v. The Queen (1966), 115 C.L.R. 44, at pp. 47, 51, 52.


               
In the South Australian case of Reg. v. Kroon
                  
    [4]
  , King C.J. observed that an offence such as culpable driving requires the relevant driving to have been voluntary and that driving while asleep does not constitute a voluntary act. Thus, he said, ""a driver cannot be convicted of causing death or bodily injury by dangerous driving in respect of a period during which the driver is asleep"". But he went on to say 
    [5]
  :Every act of falling asleep at the wheel is preceded by a period during which the driver is driving while awake and therefore, assuming the absence of involuntariness arising from other causes, responsible for his actions. If a driver who knows or ought to know that there is a significant risk of falling asleep at the wheel, continues to drive the vehicle, he is plainly driving without due care and may be driving in a manner dangerous to the public. If the driver does fall asleep and death or bodily injury results, the driving prior to the falling asleep is sufficiently contemporaneous with the death or bodily injury (McBride 
                     
    [6]
  , per Barwick C.J.) to be regarded as the cause of the death or bodily injury.
                         The cases must be rare in which a driver who falls asleep can be exonerated of driving without due care at least, in the moments preceding sleep.
                  
As King C.J. recognizes, where the question is whether a driver who falls asleep at the wheel is guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, the relevant period of driving is that which immediately precedes his falling asleep. Not only must the period be sufficiently contemporaneous with the time of impact to satisfy the requirement of s. 52A but the driving during that period must be, in a practical sense, the cause of the impact and the death. The relevant period cannot be that during which the driver was asleep because during that time his actions were not conscious or voluntary. And, for the reasons which we have given, if the driver's actions upon waking up amount to no more than an attempt to avoid an accident, it cannot be that period of driving.



                         (1990) 52 A. Crim. R. 15, at p. 18.

                         ibid., at pp. 18-19.
                     

                            (1966) 115 C.L.R., at p. 51.


               
The manner of driving encompasses ""all matters connected with the management and control of a car by a driver when it is being driven""
                  
    [7]
  . For the driving to be dangerous for the purposes of s. 52A there must be some feature which is identified not as a want of care but which subjects the public to some risk over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle, including driving by persons who may, on occasions, drive with less than due care and attention 
    [8]
  . Although a course of conduct is involved it need not take place over any considerable period 
    [9]
  . Nor need the conduct manifest itself in the physical behaviour of the vehicle. If the driver is in a condition while driving which makes the mere fact of his driving a real danger to the public, including the occupants of the motor vehicle, then his driving in that condition constitutes driving in a manner dangerous to the public. In the same way, driving a motor vehicle in a seriously defective condition may constitute driving in a manner dangerous to the public 
    [10]
  , even though the defect does not manifest itself until such time as the vehicle is out of the control of the driver. But it should be emphasized, and it must always be brought to the attention of the jury, that the condition of a driver must amount to something other than a lack of due care 
    [11]
   before it can support a finding of driving in a manner dangerous to the public. Driving in that condition must constitute a real danger to the public. As Barwick C.J. said in McBride v. The Queen 
                  
    [12]
  :The section speaks of a speed or manner which is dangerous to the public. This imports a quality in the speed or manner of driving which either intrinsically in all circumstances, or because of the particular circumstances surrounding the driving, is in a real sense potentially dangerous to a human being or human beings who as a member or as members of the public may be upon or in the vicinity of the roadway on which the driving is taking place.It follows that for a driver to be guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public because of his tired or drowsy condition that condition must be such that, as a matter of objective fact, his driving in that condition is a danger to the public. Various matters will be relevant in reaching such a conclusion. The period of the driving, the lighting conditions (including whether it was night or day) and the heating or ventilation of the vehicle are all relevant considerations. And, of course, it will be necessary to consider how tired the driver was. If there was a warning as to the onset of sleep that may be some evidence of the degree of his tiredness. And the period of driving before the accident and the amount of sleep that he had earlier had will also bear on the degree of his tiredness. But so far as ""driving in a manner dangerous"" is concerned, the issue is not whether there was or was not a warning of the onset of sleep, but whether the driver was so tired that, in the circumstances, his driving was a danger to the public. The various matters which bear on that question, and the way in which they bear on it, should be carefully drawn to the attention of the jury.

In Hill v. Baxter 
                  
    [13]
   the respondent's motor-van behaved erratically after a period during which it had apparently been driven skilfully. The defendant was charged with the offence of driving in a dangerous manner. He could remember nothing after a certain point. Lord Goddard C.J. said 
    [14]
  :There was in fact no evidence except that of the respondent, and while the justices were entitled to believe him, his evidence shows nothing except that after the accident he cannot remember what took place after he left Preston Circus. This is quite consistent with being overcome with sleep or at least drowsiness. That drivers do fall asleep is a not uncommon cause of serious road accidents, and it would be impossible as well as disastrous to hold that falling asleep at the wheel was any defence to a charge of dangerous driving. If a driver finds that he is getting sleepy he must stop.
                         I agree that there may be cases where the circumstances are such that the accused could not really be said to be driving at all. Suppose he had a stroke or an epileptic fit, both instances of what may properly be called acts of God; he might well be in the driver's seat even with his hands on the wheel, but in such a state of unconsciousness that he could not be said to be driving. A blow from a stone or an attack by a swarm of bees I think introduces some conception akin to novus actus interveniens.  In the present case I am content to rest my judgment on the ground that there was no evidence which justified the justices finding that he was not fully responsible in law for his actions, and that his intention was immaterial as there was here an absolute prohibition.

The offence of driving at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public 
    [15]
  , or the more serious but related offence of culpable driving, is not an absolute offence, at all events in the sense in which that term is used in this country. But we shall return to that later. If, in the passage which we have set out above, his Lordship was saying that falling asleep at the wheel is inevitably preceded by a period of drowsiness such that the driver has an opportunity to stop, then we are, with respect, unable to agree. That may be a convenient assumption upon the view that ""it would be impossible as well as disastrous to hold that falling asleep at the wheel was any defence to a charge of dangerous driving"", but it is not otherwise supportable. No doubt it may be proper in many cases to draw an inference that a driver who falls asleep must have had warning that he might do so if he continued to drive or that otherwise he knew or ought to have known that he was running a real risk of falling asleep at the wheel. But it does not necessarily follow that because a driver falls asleep he has had a sufficient warning to enable him to stop 
    [16]
  .

Further, the passage which we have quoted may suggest that a person while asleep is capable of driving consciously and voluntarily. Such is clearly not the case and if that is the suggestion it appears to be made upon the basis that a driver can avoid lapsing into sleep, whereas he cannot avoid other states of unconsciousness or involuntariness, such as those induced by epilepsy or being stung by a swarm of bees. But if a person's condition is such that his actions are unconscious or involuntary, it does not matter what the cause is: he cannot be found guilty of an offence, whether statutory or otherwise, unless the acts which constitute it have been done voluntarily 
    [17]
  . As we have said, a driver who drives when tired or drowsy may, depending upon all the circumstances, be guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public. But if he does fall asleep, his actions during the period of sleep are neither conscious nor voluntary.


See Reg. v. O'Connor (1980), 146 C.L.R. 64.


               
A statutory offence which imposes absolute liability is one which, in addition to excluding the requirement of mens rea, also excludes a defence of honest and reasonable mistake 
    [18]
  . In a well-known passage in Proudman v. Dayman
                  
    [19]
  , Dixon J. drew a distinction between mens rea as an ingredient of an offence and an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make a defendant's act innocent. If honest and reasonable mistake is not excluded in the case of a statutory offence, it will afford an excuse for what would otherwise be an offence, although the burden of establishing the excuse will in the first place be upon the defendant. The burden on the defendant is evidentiary only, and the prosecution retains the burden of proving guilt by establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds in the existence of facts which, in the circumstances, would take his act outside the operation of the statute 
    [20]
  . The majority of the Court in Reg. v. Coventry  recognized that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available to a charge under the equivalent of s. 52A in South Australia. In that case the majority said 
    [21]
  :No doubt the language of the section does not exclude a defence of mistake of fact on reasonable grounds or of involuntariness (for example, interference by another person with the driving of the car), and perhaps there may be other exceptional excuses, based on special facts, to which a state of mind may not be immaterial. But, speaking generally, the expression ""driving at a speed, or in a manner, which is dangerous to the public"" describes the actual behaviour of the driver and does not require any given state of mind as an essential element of the offence.

In England the courts have not taken up the defence of honest and reasonable mistake and see themselves as having to decide between an offence requiring mens rea to be proved as an ingredient and absolute liability which excludes guilty intent entirely. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal has rejected the suggestion of Lord Goddard C.J. that the offence of dangerous driving is an absolute offence. They did so in Reg. v. Gosney 
                  
    [22]
  . That was a case in which the appellant drove in the wrong direction upon one carriageway of a dual highway. The appellant wished to prove that there was no indication that the right-hand turn she made into the carriageway was prohibited and that there was nothing to indicate to a competent and careful driver in all the circumstances that she was about to drive or was driving in the wrong direction. She was stopped from leading this evidence at first instance, but the Court of Appeal held that she was entitled to do so, saying that ""fault"" on the part of the driver was an element of the offence of driving in a dangerous manner 
    [23]
  . To our eyes what the appellant was attempting to do in Gosney  was to establish an honest and reasonable mistake, a defence which, in this country, makes it unnecessary to introduce fault as an element of that offence. Driving in a manner dangerous to the public is at once both the offence and, if it is relevant, the fault, but it will be a defence to establish an honest and reasonable mistake as to facts which if true would exculpate the driver. Perhaps the most obvious example is where a driver is unaware of the defective condition of his vehicle and believes it upon reasonable grounds to be in good working order. And the same issue is raised when, in a case like the present where the dangerous manner of the driving is said to consist in the likelihood of going to sleep, a driver claims that he had no warning of the onset of sleep.

                         (1971) 55 Cr. App. R., at p. 508; see also Reg. v. Spurge (1961), 45 Cr. App. R. 191.


               
It follows from what has been said above that it was necessary for the prosecution in the present case to establish that the applicant was affected by tiredness to an extent that, in the circumstances, his driving was objectively dangerous. It was open to the jury to draw an inference to that effect from a finding that the applicant went to sleep at the wheel. It was, however, also open to the jury to find that the applicant honestly and reasonably believed that, in all the circumstances, it was safe to drive. Apart from any inference that might be drawn from the fact that the applicant had fallen asleep, there was little in the evidence to support a finding that the applicant had felt drowsy or that he had reason to believe that he was tired. He had had four hours' sleep shortly before setting out on the trip and a further period of up to three hours while the deceased woman drove the car. He had not been driving for an excessive period before the accident. There was no evidence before the jury that he had consumed any alcohol or drugs. He was thinking of stopping at the next town, but that could be explained by his statement that he intended to have breakfast there. The fact that he slept for some hours after the accident could, in the light of the other evidence including evidence that he was emotionally upset and affected by grief, scarcely found an inference that he had had insufficient sleep beforehand. In these circumstances, the inference that the applicant believed that, in all the circumstances, it was safe to drive might have been drawn by the jury from the very fact of his driving. The absence of any warning of the onset of sleep, if the jury found that there had been none, laid a foundation for that being an honest and reasonable belief. Lack of warning as to the onset of sleep is only one of a number of circumstances that may bear on the question whether a driver honestly and reasonably believed that it was safe for him to drive. Ordinarily, the circumstances which bear on whether the driving was dangerous will also bear on this question.
               
If, in a case based on tiredness, there is material suggesting that the driver honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive, the jury must be instructed with respect to that issue. In particular, they must be told that if they conclude that the driving was a danger to the public, they must also consider whether the driver might honestly have believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive. And, of course, they must be instructed in appropriate terms that the onus of negativing that defence rests with the prosecution. That did not happen in this case, presumably because neither counsel nor the trial judge appreciated the real nature of the issue raised.
               
In the present case, where there was evidence that the applicant fell asleep at the wheel and there was no real evidence that he had any warning of the onset of sleep, it was also essential for the trial judge to identify the period of driving during which it was alleged that the driving was dangerous. Further, it was essential that the jury be informed that if the applicant fell asleep, his actions while he was asleep were not voluntary and could not amount to driving in a dangerous manner. The nearest the learned trial judge came to identifying the relevant period of driving in his charge to the jury was in the following passage:The issue is, was his manner of driving when his car left the road dangerous to the public? The Crown say to you that it seems clear he became tired, he closed his eyes and the car left the road.That passage is entirely equivocal and, in any event, does not raise any question of voluntariness.
               
The applicant's counsel raised with the trial judge the fact that he failed to allude to the ""involuntary nature of  the onset of the sleeping episode"". The trial judge suggested that counsel had not alluded to that matter either. After a rejoinder by counsel that he did so in so many words although he did not use the word ""involuntary"", the matter was allowed to rest. There was no redirection. Thus objection was taken (although hardly pressed) to the omission in the charge. In these circumstances there was a defect in the charge in an important respect and that defect amounted to a miscarriage of justice.
               
Special leave to appeal should be granted. The appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed. We have given careful consideration to the question whether a new trial should be ordered. It is now more than three and a half years since the accident occurred. The applicant has already been subjected to the expense, strain and inconvenience of a trial. The case against him was not a compelling one. There was no evidence that the applicant was affected by alcohol or drugs. There was evidence to the effect that he had had adequate sleep before commencing to drive and that he had had no prior warning, or otherwise ought to have known, that he was about to fall asleep. The sentence imposed, upon the applicant's conviction, was one of periodic detention which, if it had been served, would by now have expired. In all these circumstances, we have reached the conclusion that it would be inappropriate to order a retrial.
            


               
McHugh J.
               
I would allow this appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury and that the misdirections amounted to a miscarriage of justice. The facts and the terms of s. 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 
                  N.S.W. are set out in the majority judgment.
               
Having regard to the concessions which the Crown made in this Court, I think that the learned trial judge erred in his charge to the jury in that: 1. he did not direct the jury that, for the purpose of s. 52A, the vehicle was not ""being driven"" by the applicant during any period, however short, in which the applicant was asleep; 2. he did not direct the jury that the offence was committed only if the vehicle was being driven in a manner dangerous to the public contemporaneously with the impact; 3. he did not isolate for the jury the particular features of the driving of the applicant which, as a matter of law, could be in breach of s. 52A and did not relate those features ""to the criteria to be applied and the distinctions to be observed in determining whether any particular  manner of driving can have the quality, intrinsic or occasional, o being dangerous to the public""
                  
    [24]
  ; and 4. he did not instruct the jury that the applicant could only be convicted of the charge if he knew or ought to have known that there was a real risk of his falling asleep while driving.

                     ""Being driven""
                  
                  
On the hearing of the appeal in this Court, Mr. Howie Q.C., for the Crown, accepted that, on a charge under s. 52A, there must be a voluntary act of driving. In his written submissions, Mr. Howie also conceded that a ""driver who is asleep is not then driving in a manner dangerous to the public"". But, basing himself on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia in Reg. v. Kroon
                     
    [25]
  , he contended that a ""driver who falls asleep may have been driving in a manner dangerous to the public  if he knew or ought to have known that there was a significant risk of [his] falling asleep"".



                            (1990) 52 A. Crim. R. 15, at p. 18.


                  
The concession by the Crown that a person who is ""asleep"" cannot drive in a manner dangerous to the public is debatable. For the purpose of s. 52A and other laws regulating the driving of vehicles, I think that it is at least arguable that, upon the proper construction of such legislation, a vehicle is ""being driven"" by a person if he or she falls asleep at the wheel of the car ""for a second"", as the applicant alleged he did on this occasion. No doubt it would be inconsistent with the ordinary usage of the word ""driving"" to contend that a person is driving while slumped unconscious over the steering wheel 
    [26]
  . Nevertheless, I do not think that it is inconsistent with ordinary usage to say that a person is ""driving"" a vehicle during a period in which he or she drifts off to sleep momentarily while remaining upright in the driver's seat with his or her hands and feet on the controls 
    [27]
  . A vehicle is ""being driven"" by a person when ""he is in the driving seat or in control of the steering wheel and also has something to do with the propulsion""
                     
    [28]
  . It is a matter of degree whether a person who has ""dozed off"" has functioned at such a low cognitive level for such a length of time that it can fairly be said that the vehicle was no longer ""being driven"" by that person. In some cases, the loss of consciousness of the ""driver"" may be such that it cannot be said that that person was driving the vehicle; but in other cases, the loss of consciousness may be so transient that it can be said that the vehicle was ""being driven"" by that person.

The policy of s. 52A is to punish drivers for their actual behaviour ""at the time of impact"". The section ""does not require any given state of mind as an essential element of the offence""
                     
    [29]
  . Consequently, a person continues to drive for the purpose of the section even though that person has lost control of the vehicle because his or her mind has wandered to a subject remote from driving or has lost control because of excessive speed or some other external matter concerned with the control and management of the vehicle. The policy of the section, therefore, gives no support for drawing any distinction between the driver who is inattentive or who, though attentive, is unable to control the vehicle and the driver who is unable to control the vehicle because he or she has ""dozed off"".

I do not think that anything in the foregoing discussion is inconsistent with the basic principle of the criminal law that an act or omission of a person cannot be made the subject of a criminal charge unless the act or omission was voluntary 
    [30]
  . The issue under s. 52A is not whether that general principle applies to the statute — clearly it does; the issue is whether upon the proper construction of that section the vehicle was ""being driven"" by the accused ""at the time of impact"".

Falling asleep
                  
The approach of the Crown on this appeal, however, requires that this case be examined on the basis that the acts and omissions of a person, during any period in which he or she is asleep, cannot form the subject of a charge under s. 52A of the Crimes Act. Counsel for the applicant also accepted that the law on the subject was correctly stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia in Kroon . In that case King C.J. said 
    [31]
  :Every act of falling asleep at the wheel is preceded by a period during which the driver is driving while awake and therefore, assuming the absence of involuntariness arising from other causes, responsible for his actions. If a driver who knows or ought to know that there is a significant risk of falling asleep at the wheel, continues to drive the vehicle, he is plainly driving without due care and may be driving in a manner dangerous to the public. If the driver does fall asleep and death or bodily injury results, the driving prior to the falling asleep is sufficiently contemporaneous with the death or bodily injury (McBride,  per Barwick C.J.) 
    [32]
   to be regarded as the cause of the death or bodily injury.That being so, the applicant could only be convicted of culpable driving under that section if he drove in a manner dangerous to the public, prior to his falling asleep, and if that manner of driving was, in a practical sense, contemporaneous with the impact between his vehicle and the tree.

The summing up
                  
The summing up in the present case did not confine the relevant act of driving to the period, if any, when the applicant knew or ought to have known that there was a real risk that he might fall asleep if the vehicle continued in motion. Nor did the summing up draw the jury's attention to the need for the manner of driving to be contemporaneous with the impact causing death. The learned trial judge directed the jury as to the meaning of the words ""manner dangerous to the public"" in accordance with the judgment of Barwick C.J. in McBride 
                     
    [33]
  . Significantly, however, although on a number of occasions his Honour made use of the phrase ""at the time"", he did not add the words ""of the impact"". At the very least, the summing up was ambiguous on the vital issue of ""the contemporaneity, upon which the section insists, of the driving which is in breach of the section and the impact by or through which the person is killed or injured""
                     
    [34]

Furthermore, his Honour's summing up left it open to the jury to convict the applicant on the basis that the car was being driven in a manner dangerous to the public from the time the car left the road. After stating that he would ""review in a broad fashion"" the arguments of counsel, his Honour said:The Crown say that it is for you to assess the Accused's driving of the B.M.W. car when it left the road and hit a tree. It is for you to assess whether it was in all the circumstances in a manner dangerous.Later his Honour said:The issue is, was his manner of driving when his car left the road dangerous to the public?The Crown say to you that it seems clear he became tired, he closed his eyes and the car left the road.
                     
In dealing with the submissions of counsel for the defence, his Honour said:Counsel for the Accused reminds you that the Accused had no idea that he would fall asleep for the split second as he obviously did 
                        Evaluating the whole of the evidence the Defence counsel says that there was a sudden onset of sleep. It is not as though he acknowledges feeling sleepy prior to the accident and was fighting sleep for many kilometres.
                     

                  

                  
In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Lee C.J. at C.L. correctly commented that the overall effect of his Honour's summing up was ""to leave it to the jury to acquit the appellant if they were prepared to accept that the appellant had no warning of impending sleep"". Mr. Howie went further. He submitted that the effect of the summing up was that the applicant should be acquitted if he had no warning of impending sleep. However, at no stage did his Honour tell the jury that they were bound to acquit the applicant if they concluded that he had had no warning of impending sleep. To the contrary, after referring to his ""selective"" summary of the arguments, the learned judge told the jury that it was ""for you and you alone to determine what is significant in this trial and for you and you alone to attribute to those matters such importance as you consider they deserve"". This direction made express what was already implicit in his Honour's directions: it was a matter for the jury whether they accepted the factual basis of the submission of counsel for the defence and, if they did, whether that entitled the accused to be acquitted. Having regard to the way in which the case for the Crown was left to the jury, it would occasion no surprise if the jury convicted the applicant even though they were not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew that there was a risk that he might fall asleep.
                  
Accordingly, because of the concessions of law which the Crown thought it proper to make in this Court, the summing up contained significant misdirections. It is apparent that at the trial the Crown did not dispute that the vehicle left the road as the result of the applicant's falling asleep. Moreover, it was common ground in this Court that the ""driving"" of the applicant while asleep was an involuntary act. Yet the directions of the learned judge left it open to the jury to convict the accused in respect of ""his manner of driving when his car left the road"". Consequently, the summing up left it open to the jury to convict the applicant in respect of an act for which he was not legally responsible. Having regard to the concession which the Crown made in this Court, the only case which the Crown could put against the applicant was that he was guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public because he knew or ought to have known that there was a real risk that he would fall asleep. But that case was never put to the jury. To this misdirection must be added his Honour's failure to draw to the jury's attention the need for the contemporaneity of the dangerous driving and impact.
                  
By reason of the summing up, the trial has miscarried. This is so even though counsel for the defence, after raising the issue of voluntariness, did not press for a direction on that issue. Nevertheless, the case for the Crown at the trial was so radically different from the only case which could be put on the concessions of the Crown in this Court that there has been no trial according to law. The conviction must be set aside.
               
               
                  
The appropriate order
                  
A matter which has given me concern is whether this Court should order a new trial. It was open to the jury to find that the applicant knew that there was a risk that he might fall asleep. When asked by a police officer whether he was ""feeling tired prior to the collision"", the applicant replied: ""I don't know what happened, I was driving, I was thinking about stopping in the next town. The heater was on."" At the trial, the applicant asserted that he was only thinking about stopping in the next town because he wanted to have breakfast. However, no mention of having breakfast was made in his record of interview. The references to the heater being on and stopping in the next town in the context of a question concerning whether he was feeling tired prior to the collision tell powerfully against the applicant. Those references carry the implied admission that the applicant had become tired and was thinking of resting at the next town. Why else would he mention those two matters in answer to a question concerning whether he was feeling tired prior to the collision?
                  
But the sufficiency of evidence to support the charge is not the only factor to be considered. Other factors lead to the conclusion that, despite there being evidence which, if accepted, would make out a charge of culpable driving, a new trial should not be ordered. First, as a general rule, a new trial should not be ordered to enable the Crown to make a new case at a second trial 
    [35]
  . In the present case, a second trial would allow the Crown to make a case different from that which it put to the jury at the first trial. Secondly, the events which gave rise to the charge occurred nearly four years ago, and it is nearly two years since the applicant was convicted. Thirdly, the applicant was sentenced to six months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. Prior to being granted bail pending his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant served four weekends in gaol pursuant to the order of the learned trial judge. Fourthly, the Crown has always accepted that the accident which gave rise to the charge of culpable driving arose only from the applicant's falling asleep. The Crown has not suggested that speed or alcohol played any part in the car leaving the road. When all the circumstances are taken into account, the interests of justice do not require that the applicant should be put to the expense, stress and inconvenience of a new trial so that the Crown can put a case which it did not put at the first trial. The general rule that a new trial will not be ordered so that the Crown can put a different case at a second trial must prevail.

12104,2764459,Soong v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2014] NSWSC 1030,"Judgment

1On 20 March 2013, the plaintiff was convicted of five offences under s 255-110 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) in the Local Court for failing to provide security for tax liabilities as required by the Commissioner for taxation and was fined $1,000. The plaintiff appeals to this Court under s 55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), seeking that the conviction and orders made by the Local Court be set aside. Where an appeal involves a question of fact or mixed law and fact, leave of the Court is required: s 53(1). The defendant does not oppose leave being granted in this case. 

2Section 255-110 provides - 

You commit an offence if:

(a) the Commissioner requires you to give security under section 255-100; and

(b) you fail to give that security as required.

Penalty: 100 penalty units.

3It is worth observing that whether it is, in any case, reasonable or unreasonable for the Commissioner to require security is immaterial. Furthermore, as the offence is a ""prescribed taxation offence"" for the purposes of s 8ZL of the Act, ""a statement or averment [of a matter of fact] in the information ... is prima facie evidence of the matter so stated or averred"", although this does not apply to any ""fault element of an offence"". 

4The plaintiff contends that the learned Magistrate erred in concluding that the plaintiff ""failed"", within the meaning of s 255-110, to provide the required security or, in the alternative, that such failure was not voluntary.

The first four notices

5The plaintiff was a director of Panlirn Pty Ltd. On 12 January 2011 four notices to give security for the due payment of future tax-related liabilities were issued to the plaintiff. The first required security for $2,000, to be given by 11 February 2011, by way of cheque or by way of registered mortgage over property with a net value of at least $20,000 or an unconditional bank guarantee for $2,000; the second notice required security by 25 February 2011 for $10,000 by way of cheque, mortgage over property with a net value of at least $20,000 or bank guarantee for $10,000; the third notice required security for $30,000 by 11 March 2011 by cheque, mortgage over property with a net value of $40,000 or bank guarantee for $30,000; and the fourth notice required security for a further $30,000 by 11 March 2011 by the same modes as specified in the third notice. On 18 February 2011 the first notice was complied with by the plaintiff furnishing a cheque for $2,000. Absent payment by cheque or provision of bank guarantees, the plaintiff was required to provide a mortgage over property worth at least $100,000 to cover the remaining three notices.

6On 23 February 2011 Mr Nath (the plaintiff's solicitor) wrote to the Commissioner offering to give mortgage security in respect of the outstanding three notices over a property in St Ives said to be worth $650,000 which was subject to a mortgage for $550,000, thus yielding an unencumbered value of $100,000. Mr Nath sought an extension of the time limit of 25 February (specified in the second notice) to allow for preparation and execution of the relevant security documents. On the same day, the ATO responded, extending the time for compliance with the three outstanding notices to 23 March 2011, seeking the title details and a letter for the mortgagee as to the outstanding debt, consenting to the proposed second mortgage and production of the certificate of title to enable its registration and whether fluctuating priority would be required.

7On 23 March 2011 Mr Burns from the ATO spoke to Mr Nath. They discussed a caveat on the title in favour of Mr Nath's firm, which was to be withdrawn. Mr Burns also informed Mr Nath that the plaintiff would be required to pay $5,000 towards the Commissioner's costs of preparing the mortgage documents, with any excess to be refunded, and confirming an extension of time to 31 March. In a follow-up conversation, Mr Tully of the ATO informed Mr Nath that the upfront payment of $5,000 was not negotiable and the ATO would only permit solicitors on its panel (which did not include the plaintiff's solicitors) to prepare the mortgage documents. Mr Nath wrote to the ATO on 29 March, inter alia protesting about the amount of the fee and requesting verification that it was reasonable by production of the costs agreements or quotes. It was clearly implied that, until this was done, the plaintiff would not pay the $5,000 sought. Mr Nath said his client consented to the ATO lodging a caveat ""to protect its interest ... based upon our client's agreement to give security"" and asserted that this amounted to compliance with the notices. A further extension of the notices of four weeks was sought to ""finalise and register the second mortgage"".

8On 31 March Mr Burns responded by briefly summarising the communications to date and denying that the notices had been complied with. He agreed to obtain quotes from the ATO's panel of solicitors but pointed out that this could not be done before expiration of the time limited for compliance. He agreed that, if $5,000 were paid that day, time would be extended to 7 April to allow completion of the documents and registration. The other modes of compliance with the notices were also brought to Mr Nath's attention. Later that day Mr Nath responded. He contended that there was no proper basis for the ATO's insistence on an upfront payment or, even (on one reading) any payment at all for preparation of the security documents and sought an extension of time for compliance ""to allow for the issues to be resolved ... and execution and registration of the mortgage"". Mr Burns replied several hours later, repeating the offer to supply quotes and reimburse any excess. He asked if Mr Nath's client had decided to decline to comply with the notices by utilising any of the three options offered. On 5 April Mr Nath replied that the plaintiff was always ready to execute the mortgage and simply required the Commissioner to identify a proper basis for payment of the $5,000 which was described as an ""arbitrary"" precondition. The letter concluded - 

""Accordingly, we are instructed that should the Commissioner bring any action against our client as a result of our client's failure to comply with the Notices to Give Security, our client will rely upon the above as its defence.""

No security was provided.

Further notices requiring security

9On 12 April 2011 three further notices requiring security were issued, one requiring compliance by 18 May 2011 and the two others each by 6 June 2011. The first required security for $5,000 by cheque or bank guarantee; the second required security for $25,000 by cheque, mortgage over property worth at least $30,000 or a bank guarantee for $25,000; and the third required security for $28,000 by cheque, mortgage over property worth at least $30,000 or a bank guarantee for $25,000 (sic).

10On 2 May 2011 Mr Nath wrote to Mr Burns requesting particulars of the matters relied on by the Commissioner in making the allegations in the notices which formed the basis for the requirements in each notice. On 18 May the first of these notices was complied with when the plaintiff paid $5,000 to the ATO. On 20 May the plaintiff offered to comply with the notices by way of granting a mortgage over another St Ives property which was already mortgaged but had a remaining equity of $109,000. On 24 May a solicitor in the ATO, Mr Le, informed Mr Nath that an external firm would prepare the security documents and the costs were typically between $1,500 and $5,000 and he would let him know a few days what the costs were. Mr Nath said he would get instructions. On 27 May, Mr Le wrote to Mr Nath to indicate that the ATO accepted the plaintiff's offer on condition that the mortgage was registered by 6 June 2011, that the owner (a third party) give a written assurance that he had received independent legal advice and the plaintiff agreed to pay the Commissioner's reasonable costs of preparing and registering the security and provided by 6 June 2011 a bank cheque for $1,500, which would not be refunded if the mortgage did not proceed but, if it did, would be deducted from the final amount of costs. Mr Le indicated that an external firm would prepare the documents and that he expected the final bill to be about $2,000. 

11On 30 May Mr Le was informed that two caveats were noted on the title and, on 31 May, telephoned Mr Nath to ask if they would be withdrawn before settlement. Mr Nath said that he would respond when Mr Le told him whether withdrawal was a condition of acceptance of the offer. Later that day Mr Le wrote to tell Mr Nath that withdrawal was a requirement, together with provision of the mortgagee's consent and the certificate of title at settlement; evidence of the outstanding debt secured by the first mortgage and of valuation was also required. On 31 May Mr Nath telephoned Mr Le to tell him that he had not yet obtained instructions. There was no explanation as to why this was so. On 1 June Mr Le told Mr Nath that the documentation of receipt of independent legal advice was not then required, but should be provided prior to completion. On 3 June at 4.40pm (a Friday and the last business day before expiry of the period for compliance at 4pm on the ensuing Monday) Mr Nath telephoned Mr Le and said that the plaintiff required the costs to be fixed at $2,000 and wanted an extension of the compliance date because his client was negotiating with the caveators and at that stage it was unlikely settlement could take place in time. Mr Le said he would seek instructions and respond. On 6 June at 1.21 pm Mr Le confirmed in writing to Mr Nath, in substance, that the estimated cost of preparation of the security documents was $2,000 and should be paid as agreed, with any excess being refunded by the ATO and also that failing to provide the security required by any of the three means stipulated by 4 pm on that day would be regarded as a default by the plaintiff. At 3.50pm Mr Nath called Mr Le confirming his instructions to fix costs at $2,000 and renewing the request for an extension of time. Mr Le, in effect, refused this extension. 

12Neither on 6 June or thereafter did the plaintiff comply with the remaining two April notices.

13On 7 June 2011, Mr Burns sent Mr Nath his reasons for the decision to issue the April notices as requested on 2 May 2011.

Proceedings in the Local Court

14A separate Court Attendance Notice was issued in respect of each of the notices which the Commissioner alleged had not been complied with. The learned Magistrate commenced with the conclusion, which was not disputed, that security was not provided. The plaintiff's contention was that this did not result from a deliberate act or was involuntary because the plaintiff was impecunious and unable to comply with the alternatives to giving security by way of mortgage because of various of the conditions imposed by the Commissioner. The question his Honour considered and concluded adversely to the plaintiff was whether the failure was voluntary. The plaintiff's submission was - 

""The defendant [ie, the plaintiff here] was ready, willing and able to provide security by way of a mortgage, as required by the notices, but she was unable to register the mortgage on the property due to the additional requirements imposed by the commissioner which were not identified in the notices. To the extent that the matters were within the defendant's control, the defendant did all that she could to comply with the notices.""

Although it was submitted by the plaintiff before me that the Magistrate erred in not considering the question of whether the plaintiff had ""failed"" to comply with the notices, the only arguments in this respect were those summarised in the above quotation, which he set out in his judgment. 

15In substance, the Magistrate rejected the contention that the material relied on raised a doubt about the plaintiff's ability to comply with at least the other alternative modes of satisfying the notices. So far as the mortgage proposal was concerned, his Honour referred to Mr Nath's evidence that he did not have any instructions that the plaintiff could not, at least, pay the $5,000 upfront amount for costs and, in substance, (rightly) rejected the submission that compliance with the requirement as to this payment was impossible by virtue of impecuniosity. However, it appears that his Honour did not think it necessary to pursue the mortgage issue to conclusion, given his conclusion about the availability of the alternatives as to which he concluded there was no suggestion put to the Commissioner that the plaintiff could not comply with the notice by way of the other remaining methods of payment. There was no evidence that raised the issue of involuntariness; at all events his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the failure to provide security was voluntary and deliberate.

Consideration

16The plaintiff submits that, in each case, the reason for the security not being provided was that it was impossible for her to do so, an impossibility for which she was not responsible. It is argued that the prosecution bore the onus of proving that the plaintiff ""failed"" to comply with the notices and that the Magistrate should not have been so satisfied. It is submitted that she could not do so because of an impossibility for which she was not responsible, which arose in two respects: firstly, the Commissioner stipulated an unreasonable time for compliance with each Notice; and, secondly, the Commissioner unreasonably withheld his cooperation in respect of each Notice by making compliance conditional on the plaintiff making a down payment of an arbitrary sum towards the Commissioner's costs of preparing the mortgage documentation.

17It is submitted on the plaintiff's behalf that the Commissioner was required to prove that the times specified in the notices and subsequently extended were reasonable. The Magistrate, in substance, held that there was nothing to suggest that the time limits in respect of the two stipulated modes other than the mortgage were in any way unreasonable and, as they remained available to the plaintiff at all times, there was no reason to doubt that they could have been complied with. So far as the mortgage option was concerned, the plaintiff draws attention to the fact that, although the notices referred to the possibility of complying with the requirement by giving a mortgage, they did not explain that the documentation would have to be prepared by solicitors on the ATO's panel, that it was a prerequisite that an amount on account of costs would need to be paid and, in respect of the mortgagor being a third party, it would be necessary to provide evidence that he or she had obtained independent legal advice. However, it should be noted that, although the date for compliance was initially set at 25 February 2011 in respect of what I have called the second notice, the first communication by the plaintiff with the ATO in respect of it was on 23 February, when Mr Nath wrote to offer security by way of mortgage. There was no explanation for this delay which, on the face of it, appears to be entirely within the plaintiff's control and as a result of her decision. There was no evidence that, had the plaintiff acted promptly on receipt of the notices on 12 January, it would have been difficult to provide the required security by way of mortgage (had that been the plaintiff's choice) well before the compliance date for that notice, a fortiori for the notices requiring compliance by 11 March. The incidents of executing and registering a mortgage are notoriously the commonplace of a solicitor's work. Mr Nath never suggested the slightest difficulty in this respect. Furthermore, it is self evident that, although this was not expressly stated, the provision of security would necessarily have been at the expense of the taxpayer, otherwise the security would not have covered the amount specified. 

18The plaintiff notes that, on 23 March, Mr Burns for the first time imposed the condition that the caveats be withdrawn and the legal costs of $5,000 be paid as a precondition. As to these matters, the plaintiff obtained a significant extension of time. There is no evidence that the requirement as to the caveats could not be complied with within the new timeframe or, for that matter, that the amount in respect of costs could not be paid by then. It is true that the Commissioner did not seek to justify the costs except in a general way. However, Mr Nath did not propose any lesser sum as appropriate and there was no evidence that, in light of the ATO's experience in this regard, the amount was unreasonable especially given the undertaking to repay any excess. (During argument I expressed the view that the sum seemed excessive but this was not the case actually sought to be made before the Magistrate.) The case sought to be made before me was that the requirement should not have been imposed without giving a proper basis by way of quote or costs agreement in respect of the amount. Even if this were so, I am unable to see how the refusal to pay it - accepting this was the reason for not entering into security, as to which there is really no evidence - was rendered impossible in any relevant sense. The need for a reasonable time to be allowed is obvious: it must be actually possible, by reasonable diligence, to comply with the requirement. However, the plaintiff also submits that it is necessary that the conditions for compliance, such as the requirement of prepayment of legal costs, be reasonable. I do not agree that this is necessary in the same sense. It is obviously possible to comply with a requirement (otherwise within the person's capacity), even if that requirement is unreasonable. The argument about this matter is rather unreal in light of the failure by the plaintiff to lead any evidence at all on the amount of costs usually applicable to the preparation of a mortgage. I do not consider that the Commissioner bore any onus of proving that the requirement of an upfront payment for legal costs in the sum of $5,000 with an undertaking to refund any excess was reasonable. At all events, the requirement strikes me as completely reasonable. 

19The plaintiff complains that the extension of time granted on 23 March to 28 March gave her only five clear working days to ""raise $5,000 and forward it to the Commissioner; ... wait for the Commissioner to arrange for the preparation of the security documentation; ... obtain legal advice in respect of the documentation; ... execute the mortgage documents; ... and wait for the Commissioner to register the mortgage documents"". It is significant, to my mind, that Mr Nath did not complain about this extension. It was only on 30 March that Mr Nath raised a problem about the prepayment. He did not suggest that it was difficult, let alone impossible, to pay this sum and there was no evidence before the Magistrate that suggested this was the case. It is enough to say that I do not accept this contention. There is no reason to think that the time frame was not adequate, even if it might have been difficult to comply with.

20So far as the April notices were concerned, it is submitted that the time for compliance with the requirements notified on 31 May 2011 was unreasonable. The first point to be made is that Mr Nath, when he received the letter, did not suggest this was so and the only problems he raised were on 1 June about the letter of independent advice and on 3 June related to negotiations with the caveators. There was no disclosure, let alone evidence, as to the nature of these negotiations and it is impossible to evaluate their significance. The other conditions were patently able to be quickly satisfied. Furthermore, they were obvious requirements which any reasonably competent solicitor would have foreseen. It is fair to observe that Mr Nath did not suggest he did not have the information, let alone that he was surprised by the request for it.

21The plaintiff described the Commissioner's insistence on prepayment of the legal costs as an unreasonable withdrawal of cooperation. It is firstly argued (but not before the Magistrate) that there was no power to require such a down payment. Section 255-100 empowers the Commissioner to require a person ""to give security for due payment of an existing or future tax-related liability"" but not, it is argued, to require payment of the costs. Thus, it is said, the plaintiff was entitled to dispute it. In my view, the clear import of the power is that the costs of compliance lay with the taxpayer and it is necessarily incidental to permitting a taxpayer to provide security otherwise than by deposit or bank guarantee (necessarily to be obtained at the taxpayer's expense) that the costs of so doing be paid by the taxpayer. That the Commissioner required the work to be performed by one of the solicitors on its panel whose bill would be paid by the taxpayer is, to my mind, plainly within the power of the Commissioner as ancillary to the compliance regime. Not only was it lawful, it is for the reasons I have mentioned reasonable. At all events, the fact that a taxpayer disputes the reasonableness of a requirement does not make it impossible to comply with: the simple fact is that the plaintiff (for reasons which may have seemed justifiable to her) decided she would not comply.

22The prosecution accepted that it bore the onus of establishing the failure of the plaintiff in the relevant sense to provide the required security. It was necessary that it prove beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff's failure was intentional. A refinement of this element was the argument raised by the plaintiff that the omission to provide the security was not a failure in the relevant sense if it was impossible for the plaintiff to comply with the requirement. 

23The only evidence that the plaintiff was, as was contended in the Local Court and here, ""ready willing and able to provide security by way of mortgage"" was contained in the communications of Mr Nath. This was not an adequate basis for concluding this was in fact the position. Nor did they provide a sound evidentiary basis for the assertion that, in fact, the plaintiff did all that she could to comply with the notices. There was no evidence at all as to what she could or did do, except as asserted by Mr Nath. Quite apart from the delays to which I have already referred, there was no evidence, let alone explanation as to why the plaintiff could not - as distinct from would not - comply with the notices by adopting the alternative courses. The contention advanced on the plaintiff's behalf was her impecuniosity prevented it. The evidence said to support this contention was the imposition of a direct penalty of about $5 million, the service in March 2011 of a bankruptcy notice by the Commissioner, and the total sum of security sought, including in a previous notice relating to other companies of which she was a director. Quite apart from the fact that Mr Nath never suggested the plaintiff was impecunious or otherwise unable to adopt the alternatives, it is self evident that the mere existence of substantial debts or even of a creditor having taken the step of issuing a Bankruptcy Notice does not imply the impecuniosity of the debtor: many very wealthy persons have very substantial liabilities. Nor can it raise a doubt about the ability to pay. 

24Although I accept that the Commissioner bore the onus of establishing that the security was not provided as required and that this was due to the intentional act or omission of the taxpayer, the issue of impossibility because of impecuniosity was not raised by the evidence such as to require the Commissioner to prove that the taxpayer had the means to comply with any of the stipulated alternatives. 

25It is also contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the conduct was involuntary or, more precisely, that the Commissioner failed to prove it was voluntary. This argument also depends upon the alleged impecuniosity of the plaintiff, the unreasonableness of the timeframes imposed for compliance and the submission that the Commissioner withheld cooperation by making compliance by way of mortgage conditional upon down payment of the legal costs. For the reasons already given, this submission is without merit. The new argument is raised under this head that, by the time it became clear that ""the parties could not reach agreement in the preparation of the mortgage documents it was impractical to obtain the necessary cheques or bank guarantees"" (emphasis added). This submission cannot be accepted. That the parties did not reach agreement is plain, but this is by no means the same as agreement not being possible. Patently, it was possible for the plaintiff to have agreed with the Commissioner's requirements. Nor is there any evidence which suggests the impracticability, let alone the impossibility of the plaintiff complying by using the alternative methods. 

26The involuntariness argument was also put by way of contending that the Magistrate erred in concluding that the Plaintiff's failure to provide security was intentional. It is not improved by being recast in this way. In my respectful view the conclusion of his Honour about this matter was not only correct: it was inevitable.

Conclusion

27The summons is dismissed with costs.

      ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v. PETER ANDREW QUINN 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 By summons filed on 24 April 2007, the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales sought orders pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”). The Attorney General sought interim relief pursuant to s.16(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    2 On 24 April 2007, Hidden J made ex-parte orders abridging time for the service of the Summons and directed that the application for relief sought in paragraphs 1 – 4 of the Summons be heard and determined on an urgent basis and on or before 13 May 2007. On that date the court directed that the hearing of the claims for relief sought in paragraphs numbered 5 to 8 of the Summons be expedited. 
     
      
    3 The Attorney General (“the plaintiff”) claimed interim orders pursuant to s.16(1), s.21(1) and s.15(4) of the Act. The hearing in respect of such claims occurred on 8 May 2007. On 9 May 2007, I made orders pursuant to s.16(1) and s.20(1) of the Act. Additional orders were made pursuant to s.15(4) for the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate examinations and to furnish reports to the Court by 1 June 2007 and for the defendant, Peter Andrew Quinn, to attend such examinations. (Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 456). The order made pursuant to s.16(1) for the interim detention of the defendant was for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007. 
     
      
    4 On 7 June 2007, I made orders pursuant to s.16(3) of the Act that the interim detention order made on 9 May 2007 be renewed and to take effect from 10 June 2007 for a period of 28 days. The plaintiff’s claim for final relief was listed for hearing on 16, 17, 18 and 25 July 2007. 
     
      
    5 On 27 June 2007 the Common Law Duty Judge, Price J, made a further order extending the defendant’s interim detention. The court ordered that the previous order made on 7 June 2007 be renewed, to take effect from 8 July 2007 for a further period of 28 days or until the claim for final orders made by the plaintiff was determined, which ever was the shorter period. 
     
      
    6 On the hearing of the proceedings there was tendered reports of Dr Anthony Samuels and Dr Jeremy O’Dea, who were appointed by the Court for the purpose of examining the defendant and preparing reports. Dr Samuels’ report was dated 30 May 2007 and Dr O’Dea’s report was dated 1 June 2007. The defendant tendered the report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 19 June 2007. Those three medical witnesses also gave oral evidence. The defendant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    7 The principal order sought by the plaintiff by way of final relief, pursuant to s. 17(1)(b) of the Act, is an order for the detention of the defendant in a correctional centre for five years from the date of the order. Alternatively, an extended supervision order was sought in the event that the Court declined to make a continuing detention order. 
     
      
    8 On the hearing of this application for final orders, the Crown Advocate, Mr Lloyd Babb of counsel, with Dr David T Kell of counsel, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr Mark Austin, Public Defender, appeared on behalf of the defendant. 
     
      
       
      Evidence in support of the application for final orders 
       
      
    9 The plaintiff read and relied upon affidavit evidence, being the affidavits of the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “14. In support of the claims for final relief, the plaintiff has read the following 13 affidavits:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) affidavit of Sharon Klamer affirmed 2 May 2007;

          (vii) affidavit of Narcisa Sutton affirmed 5 June 2007;

    (ix) second (confidential) affidavit of Sue Knight affirmed 6 June 2007; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (x) affidavit of Christina Valentine affirmed 24 April 2007; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (xi) affidavit of Christina Valentine affirmed 2 May 2007; 
          
         
        
       
      
    (xii) affidavit of Denes Blazer affirmed 7 May 2007; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (xiii) affidavit of Mariella Schattiger affirmed 12 July 2007.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 Exhibited to the affidavit of Christina Valentine, affirmed on 2 May 2007, were copies of a number of files relating to the defendant, being files of the Department of Corrective Services. They were marked as Exhibit CJV 1(1) to (7). Documents constituting the Cubit treatment file relating to the defendant was tendered as Exhibit A (the file was labelled CJV1(8). 
     
      
    11 I note that the files of the Department of Corrective Services to which I have referred were produced pursuant to an order made by the Attorney General under s. 25 of the Act.  
     
      
    12 Any document or report which the Attorney General by order, under s.25, requires, and is referred to in s.25(1), is admissible in proceedings under the Act. 
     
      
    13 Mr Austin of counsel, correctly stated that the expert evidence directed to the issues under s.17(3) of the Act falls into three distinct categories. Firstly, the evidence concerning the statistical probability of the defendant re-offending based upon a consideration of what are termed the “static factors”. Secondly, the individualised assessment of the risk of the defendant committing further sexual offences on release based upon interviews and assessments of him by a psychologist. Thirdly, individualised assessment by three psychiatrists. 
     
      
       
      Expert evidence 
       
      
    14 Evidence was given by Ms Sharon Klamer, registered psychologist, for the plaintiff. Ms Klamer has worked as a psychologist with the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services since 2000. She presently holds the position of Forensic Psychologist, Sex Offender Programs, Forensic Psychology Services within the Department. She has held that position since March 2007. 
     
      
    15 Ms Klamer’s affidavit affirmed on 2 May 2007 included her Risk Assessment Report dated 18 April 2007, Exhibit 2 to her affidavit. Ms Klamer interviewed the defendant on 27 February 2007 for approximately two hours and on 2 March 2007 for approximately one hour. She undertook a risk assessment relating to him based upon both Static Risk Factors using the Static-99 Actuarial Risk Assessment Tool and upon Dynamic Risk Factors. Her overall assessment and conclusion was that the defendant is a high risk sex offender. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the statistical analysis was “simply a rough tool used by the experts in this case as a starting point for their assessment. Even though similar static risk analysis is considered, there is a fundamental conflict between the opinions offered by the psychologists and the psychiatrists giving evidence in these proceedings” (Defendant’s Outline of Submissions, at pp.9-10). 
     
      
    16 I will return to consider Ms Klamer’s evidence later in this judgment. 
     
      
    17 The medical evidence in the proceedings for final relief included the reports of Doctors Samuels and O’Dea to which I have referred and a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, consultant psychiatrist, dated 19 June 2007 (Exhibit 1). Dr Nielssen was retained on behalf of the defendant. 
     
      
       
      The statutory scheme for supervision and detention of serious sex offenders 
       
      
    18 The Act commenced on the date of its assent, namely on 3 April 2006. Pursuant to s.2 of the Act it came into operation on that date. The long title to the Act is An Act to Provide for the Supervision and Detention of Serious Sex Offenders; and for other purposes. 
     
      
    19 Section 3, Objects of the Act, provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        3 Objects of Act 
         
         
        The objects of this Act are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as-: 
         
         
        (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders.”  
        
       
      
    20 The expression “serious sex offence”, is defined in s. 5(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    21 Pursuant to s.14(1) of the Act, the Attorney General may apply to the Supreme Court for a continuing detention order against a sex offender who, when the application is made, is in custody in a correctional centre. The expression “sex offender” is defined by s.4 of the Act as meaning “… a person who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence, other than an offence committed while the person was a child”. The expression “Continuing detention order” is defined in s.4 of the Act as meaning “a continuing detention order made under s.17”. 
     
      
    22 No issue is taken in these proceedings on behalf of the defendant as to the application of the Act to him. In other words, it was accepted that the defendant came within the definition of a “sex offender” and that he was serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention for “a serious sex offence” or “an offence of a sexual nature” in accordance with the provisions of s.14(1). I will return to the application of this provision to the defendant: see paragraph [71] below. 
     
      
    23 The Second Reading Speech of the Minister on the Reading of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Bill recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Attorney-General will be able to seek two types of orders: extended supervision orders, dealt with under part 2; and continuing detention orders, dealt with under part 3 … 
        
       
       
        
        It is appropriate that the Attorney-General, as the first law officer of the State, consider any proposal to make an application – following advice from the Commissioner of Corrective Services to the Minister for Justice – before matters are filed in the Supreme Court …” 
        
       
      
    24 The Attorney General for the State of New South Wales is the person who has locus standi to make application to the Supreme Court for an order under the Act. Accordingly, the Attorney General has the statutory right to make an application under the Act and it is clear that the Attorney’s right to do so is one that is exercisable in the public interest. 
     
      
    25 The Act recognises that the administrative functions in respect of correctional centres for persons who are held in custody in the correctional centre is vested in the Commissioner of Corrective Services. The responsible Minister under s.32 of the Act, in terms of any review of it, may require the Commissioner of Corrective Services to provide information as to how the Commissioner’s functions in relation to the administration of the Act are being, and have been, exercised. 
     
      
    26 The statutory scheme established by the Act provides jurisdiction in the Supreme Court for the making interim orders (ss.8 and 16) and orders by way of final relief (ss.9 and 17). These are to be found in Part 2 and Part 3 of the Act. 
     
      
    27 Part 2 – Extended Supervision Orders provides that the Attorney General may apply to the Supreme Court for an extended supervision order against a sex offender. There is no definition of the concept of “supervision” as used in s.9(2). As earlier indicated, in the present proceedings, the Attorney General applies for an extended supervision order in the event that the primary relief sought, a continuing detention order, is refused. 
     
      
    28 Part 3 – Continuing Detention Orders, s.17 provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        17 Determination of application for continuing detention order 
         
         
          
          (1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for a continuing detention order:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) by making an extended supervision order, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) by making a continuing detention order, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) by dismissing the application. 
            
           
          
          
          (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) the safety of the community, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) the reports received from the psychiatrists appointed under s.15(4) to conduct psychiatric examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination, 
             
             
            (c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment, 
             
             
            (d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 
             
             
            (e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such program and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs, 
             
             
            (f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, 
             
             
            (g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004, 
             
             
            (h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 
             
             
            (i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature. 
            
           
          
         
         
        (5) Part 2 applies to an extended supervision order made under this section in the same way as it applies to an extended supervision order made under s.9 
        .” 
        
       
      
    29 Section 17(3) is a key provision. As the Crown Advocate, with respect, correctly submitted, the burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy the Court “… to a high degree of probability …” that (Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions, paragraph 37):- 
     
      
       
      (a) the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision; and 
       
       
      (b) adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 
       
      
    30 The plaintiff submitted that the phrase “adequate supervision” in s.17(3) means “supervision that is such as to eliminate or at least substantially reduce the likelihood that the defendant will re-offend”. (paragraph 4 of the Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions). The ordinary meaning of “adequate” includes “commensurate in fitness, sufficient, satisfactory”: Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Fifth Edition. 
     
      
    31 It was further submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the time at which the issue of the adequacy of the suggested supervision is to be assessed is the time when the Court is contemplating making an order under s.13(3). Accordingly, the plaintiff submitted that if the Court is satisfied as to the first stage of the test dealing with risk and is thus contemplating making a continuing detention order, the question of the adequacy of suggested supervision is to be determined at the present point in time, rather than by reference to what conditions may or may not be able to be put in place at some future time. This, he submitted, was because the fundamental objective of the legislation is the protection of the public referring, in that respect, to Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 (McClellan CJ at CL, 13 April 2006 at [21]). 
     
      
    32 In the present application, it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, in terms of the second part of the test in s.17(3), the court could not be satisfied that adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order in the circumstances established by the evidence in the present case. 
     
      
    33 Section 18 deals with the term or period of operation of a detention order and provides a maximum period of five years. It provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        18 Term of continuing detention order 
         
         
        (1) A continuing detention order: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) commences when it is made, or when the offender’s current custody expires, whichever is the later, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 
          
         
         
        (2) An offender’s custody under a continuing detention order is suspended while the offender is in lawful custody under any other Act or law, but that suspension does not affect the expiry date of the order. 
         
         
        (3) Nothing in this section prevents the Supreme Court from making a second or subsequent continuing detention order against the same offender.” 
        
       
      
    34 The Supreme Court has jurisdiction following the making of a detention order to revisit, on application being made, the order and make further orders in accordance with s.19, which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        19 Detention order may be varied or revoked 
         
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke a continuing detention order or interim detention order on the application of the Attorney General or the offender. 
         
         
        (2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to a continuing detention order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months. 
        ” 
        
       
       
      Proceedings under the Act 
       
      
    35 The Supreme Court is the only court with jurisdiction under the Act. Sections 7 and 15 provide for pre-trial procedures respectively in respect of extended supervision orders and continuing detention orders. Such procedures include a preliminary hearing into the application. It was at the preliminary hearing in the present proceedings that orders were made appointing Drs Samuels and O’Dea to whom I have earlier referred to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and in relation to which they have reported as required. An order was also made directing the defendant to attend those examinations, which, of course, he did. 
     
      
    36 Section 21 in Part 4 of the Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        21 Nature of proceedings 
         
         
        Proceedings under this Act (including proceedings on an appeal under this Act) are civil proceedings and, to the extent to which this Act does not provide for their conduct, are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings 
        .” 
        
       
      
    37 Section 22 provides a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from any determination of the Supreme Court to make, or to refuse to make, an extended supervision order or continuing detention order. Such appeal may be made on a question of law, a question of fact, or a question of mixed law and fact.  
     
      
    38 Section 24 of the Act provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        24 Preservation of Supreme Court jurisdiction 
         
         
        Nothing in this Act limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court apart from this Act. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    39 Section 27 of the Act makes it clear that a party to proceedings under the Act may appear either personally or by his or her legal representatives, may call witnesses and give evidence and may cross-examine witnesses and make submissions to the Court on any matter connected with the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The test under s.17(3) of the Act 
       
      
    40 Mr Austin, on behalf of the defendant, made a number of submissions concerning what he contended was the proper construction of the provisions of s.17(3), a key provision in the Act. It is convenient, here, to reproduce those provisions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “17(3) A continuing detention order may be made if, and only if, the Supreme Court is satisfied  
        to a high degree of probability 
         that the offender  
        is likely 
         to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision  
        and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order 
        .” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    41 In this submissions, Mr Austin observed that s.17(3) is composed of three parts:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The standard of proof  
      “if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability” 
      . This, it was said, works in conjunction with two facts that must be established, namely, (b) and (c) below. 
       
       
      (b) That  
      “the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence” 
       if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
       
       
      (c) That  
      “adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order” 
      . 
       
      
    42 It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the key to interpreting s.17(3) with the terms “if and only if”, “high degree of probability” and “likely”. Reference was made to the dicta of McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher (supra) at [34]. There, his Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… one potential difficulty with the subsection is the conjunction of that requirement, ie, that the Court be satisfied to a ‘high degree of probability’, with the question of whether the offender is ‘likely to commit a further serious sex offence’. The word ‘likely’ presently appears to me to be used in its ordinary meaning which, as the High Court pointed out in  
        Boughey v The Queen 
         (1986) 161 CLR at 10 conveys the notion of ‘substantial – a real and no remote – chance regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 percent’.” 
        
       
      
    43 McClellan CJ at CL at [35] added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, it will be necessary to give careful consideration to the context in which the word ‘likely’ is used in the present legislation upon the final determination of this matter.” 
        
       
      
    44 In the present case, the plaintiff contended for the interpretation in Gallagher (supra). Mr Austin’s submission on behalf of the defendant was that this Court should not apply that interpretation but should follow the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in TSL v The Secretary to the Department of Justice [2006] VSCA 199. That Court was concerned with the provisions of The Serious Sex Offenders’ Monitoring Act 2005 (Vic) (the “Monitoring Act”). 
     
      
    45 Section 11(1) of that Act provided:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court may only make an extended supervision order in respect of an offender if it is satisfied to a high degree of probability, that the offender is likely to commit a relevant offence if released in the community on completion of the service of any custodial sentence that he/she is serving, or serving at the time …” 
        
       
      
    46 In that case, the Victorian Court of Appeal considered the High Court’s judgment in Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR at 10 and the ordinary meaning of the word “likely”. Mr Austin observed that, whilst ordinarily there was no reason to think that “likely” must be more than 50%, the Monitoring Act contemplated an extraordinary remedy, namely, requiring a person who had served their sentence to be subject to monitoring if an order was made. He submitted that this had caused the Court to look at the meaning of the words chosen by Parliament and the context in which they appeared. 
     
      
    47 The Victorian Supreme Court concluded that the word “likely”, in context, meant that it should not be given its ordinary meaning, but rather than it required a high degree of probability. Mr Austin submitted that that Court preferred a meaning applying a much stricter test because it would be “inconceivable” that Parliament would have intended the word “likely” to bear its ordinary meaning as “all too many offenders are likely in that sense to commit a relevant offence” (at [10]). 
     
      
    48 Mr Austin further submitted that simply to make the decision based on likelihood would mean that too many prisoners, most of whom statistically had a chance of re-offending, would be caught by the legislation. He stated in this respect (defendant’s outline of submissions, paragraph (A)(h)):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the section required, first, a standard of proof requiring a high degree of probability of likelihood, which in turn had to be applied to facts which also have a high degree of probability.” 
        
       
      
    49 Reference was made, in this respect, to the observation of the Victorian Court of Appeal at [12]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The conclusion that the word ‘likely’ in s.11 is used in the sense of a high degree of probability, accords with the main purpose of the Monitoring Act stated in s.1.” 
        
       
      
    50 Section 1 of the Monitoring Act relates to the protection of society. Mr Austin observed that the purposes of the New South Wales Act was both the protection of society and the rehabilitation of the offender. He also observed that s.17(3) uses the words “if and only if it is satisfied” as against the relevant provision in the Victorian scheme which uses the phrase “if it is satisfied”. 
     
      
    51 Further reliance in support of the defendant’s submissions was placed upon the difference between the scheme that operates under the New South Wales legislation whereby a detention order may be made. In Victoria, only a supervision order can be made. 
     
      
    52 In Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605, Bell J considered the provisions of s.17(3). Bell J rejected the approach in TSL (supra) stating:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In this respect it seems to me that the plaintiff’s submission that s.17(3) of the Act should be construed in accordance with its terms not by reference to the approach taken to the Victorian Monitoring Act has force.” 
        
       
      
    53 Bell J, in applying the test, stated (at [165]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account the expert evidence, particularly the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Professor Greenberg and looking at the inferences to be drawn from the defendant’s pattern of past offending, upon the standard of proof of high probability, I consider the plaintiff has established that it is likely that the defendant will commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. In this respect, I note Professor Greenberg’s opinion … which is that in the absence of treatment over an extended period of time, the defendant’s risk of re-offending is greater than the chance of not re-offending.” 
          
        
       
      
    54 Mr Austin submitted that the approach and interpretation adopted by Bell J was wrong and should not be followed. He relied, in particular, on the principles stated in the case law which emphasises that statutory interpretation requires a Court to have regard to the context of the legislation in the first instance and not merely after some kind of ambiguity is established: CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] and Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Baldock [2007] NSWCA 35 per Spigelman CJ at [15]. 
     
      
    55 Mr Austin also relied upon the provisions of s.33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 which states that the interpretation of a provision of an Act which would promote the purpose of object underlying it should be preferred to a construction that that would not promote that purpose of object. 
     
      
    56 He submitted that the New South Wales Parliament could not be presumed to have been ignorant of the Victorian Monitoring Act and that the phrase “if and only if” plays an important role in the construction of the provision. In particular, it makes the New South Wales standard of proof “… stricter and reinforces the exceptional nature of the remedy provided for” (defendant’s outline of submissions A(o)). 
     
      
    57 Bell J in Tillman (supra) closely examined the analysis of the Victorian Court of Appeal in TSL (supra). Her Honour observed that the Court in that case took into account the provisions of s.7(2) of the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. Her Honour stated that she proposed to adopt (at [27]) the approach favoured by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher (supra), namely, to take the words “is satisfied to a high degree of probability” in s.17(3) as the statement of a statutory standard of proof which is higher than the civil standard, but lower than the criminal standard. Her Honour stated at [33]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I take into account his Honour’s observation that the inclusion of the words ‘if and only if’ emphasises ‘the care’ with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person’s liberty.” 
        
       
      
    58 Her Honour also noted the observations of McClellan CJ at CL that it would be necessary to give careful consideration to the context in which “likely” is used in s.17(3) on final hearing. Following reference to dicta of Gibbs CJ and of Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ in Boughey (supra), her Honour concluded that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The Act requires the Court to be satisfied of the likelihood of future offending. In this context it is not clear that likelihood is to be equated with ‘a real chance’, which I take to be a prediction falling well short of probability, albeit one that is more than a mere possibility. I have approached the determination in this case upon the basis that ‘likely’ in this context conveys the sense that it is probable, as distinct from possible, that the defendant will commit a further serious sex offence.” 
        
       
      
    59 Her Honour went on to state at [30]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff must establish to a high degree of probability that (1) the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision and (2) that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. If the plaintiff establishes both, the Court may make a detention order. In the event the plaintiff establishes (1) but does not establish (2) the Court may make an extended supervision order. The Court retains a discretion not to make either order.” 
        
       
      
    60 In his written submissions, Mr Austin contended that the Victorian Court of Appeal’s reference in TSL to the Charter of Human Rights did no more than state, what in the absence of the Charter, the common law would have required; a respect for basic common law principles. These, he contended (defendant’s outline of submissions, A(s)):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… include the right to liberty, an aversion to preventative detention, and a requirement for proportionality in sentencing. So much has been recognised in relation to the legislation which allows for indefinite determination. It has been held that this legislation is exceptional and to be sparingly exercised and to be sparingly exercised, and then only in clear cases:  
        Moffit v Crown 
         [1998] 2 VR 229 at 255 per Hayne JA.” 
          
        
       
      
    61 Mr Austin further submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(u) As a corollary to the argument that the powers be sparingly exercised and only in exceptional cases it can be asserted that legislation which derogates from fundamental common law principles must be interpreted so far as possible in a way that respects those principles unless a contrary intention is shown. Courts do not require a Charter or Rights and Responsibilities to do this.” 
        
       
      
    62 In support of this submission, specific reliance was placed upon the words of the section, in particular, “if and only if” and “a high degree of probability” which operate in conjunction with the word “likely”. Reliance was also placed upon the scheme of the Act and what was said in the Second Reading Speech and s.33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 as well as the legislation and what was contended was its “extraordinary” application. Finally, it was submitted that any interpretation must respect fundamental human rights and common law principles unless the contrary intention is shown. 
     
      
    63 The final submission on this question of construction was that “… this extraordinary legislation, with its extraordinary consequences, must call for an extraordinary interpretation of likelihood – a high degree of probability” (defendant’s outline of submission, A(w)). 
     
      
    64 In support of this latter submission, it was contended that to hold otherwise would mean that the large bulk of offenders would be caught by the test, given the real risk that anyone gaoled for a sexual (or other offence for that matter) was at risk of committing a further offence. 
     
      
    65 It is relevant at this point to refer to the principles of judicial comity, for they have a bearing upon whether there exists a basis upon which I ought follow and adopt the interpretation of s.17(3) as enunciated by Bell J or whether another course is and should be taken by me in relation to that question. 
     
      
    66 In Mustac v Medical Board of Western Australia [2007] WASC 128, Martin CJ stated at [38] that the practice of judicial comity is, of course, distinct from, but related to, the doctrine of precedent (or stare decisis) which compels each Court in a judicial hierarchy to follow and apply decisions of any Court higher in that hierarchy on questions of law. The practice of judicial comity applies to augment that doctrine by creating a non-binding practice applicable to decisions of Courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, or as between a Court in one judicial hierarchy, and a Court the same or a higher level in another judicial hierarchy, and provides that questions of law should usually (but not always) be determined the same way. Martin CJ there observed that the practice was well described by Burchett J in La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1992) 110 CLR 201 in the following terms at 204:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The doctrine of stare decisis does not, of course, compel the conclusion that a judge must always follow a decision of another judge of the same Court. Even a decision of a single justice of the High Court exercising original jurisdiction, while ‘deserving of the closest and respectful consideration’, does not make that demand upon a judge of this Court:  
        Businessworld Computers Pty Limited v Australian Telecommunications Commission 
         (1988) 2 ALR 499 at 504. But the practice in England, and I think also in Australia, is that ‘a judge of first instance will as a matter of judicial comity, usually follow the decision of another judge at first instance … unless he is convinced that the judgment was wrong’, Halsbury, 4th ed, Vol 26, para 580. The word ‘usually’ indicates that the approach required is a flexible one, and the authorities illustrate that its application may be influenced, either towards or away from an acceptance of the earlier decision, by circumstances so various as to be difficult to comprehend within a single concise formulation of principle. … Understood as expressing a usual or general rule, the following statement of Rogers J in  
        Hamilton Island Enterprises Pty Limited v FCT 
         [1982] 1 NSWLR 113 at 119 is consistent with the proposition I have quoted from Halsbury:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In my view, it is of cardinal importance in the proper administration of justice that single judges of State Supreme Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction should strive for uniformity in the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation. Unless I were of the view that the decision of another judge of co-ordinate authority was clearly wrong, I would follow his decision.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    67 Martin CJ also referred to the decision of Street CJ in Regina v Abbrederis [1981] 1 NSWLR 530 at 542 wherein it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As a matter of precedent, this Court is not, of course, bound by the decision of the Full Court of Victoria. But I have not the slightest doubt that, where a Commonwealth statute has been construed by the ultimate appellate court within any State or Territory, that construction should, as a matter of ordinary practice, be accepted and applied by the Courts of other States and Territories, so long as it is permitted to stand unchanged either by the Court of origin or by the High Court. The risk of differing interpretations amongst the States is thus negated and, in practical terms, a uniform application of Commonwealth laws throughout Australia is assured.” 
        
       
      
    68 In the circumstances of the present matter, the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal being concerned with Victorian legislation different in terms than the New South Wales Act, such decision cannot be taken as authoritative in relation to the provisions of s.17(3). Furthermore, given that Bell J specifically examined the Victorian Act the subject of that decision, her Honour having closely considered its provisions, construed “likely” to mean “probable”. In those circumstances, there is no basis for departing from or taking a different approach to the construction of s.17(3) to that set out in the judgment of Bell J unless I concluded that there existed a basis upon which I could conclude that the decision of Bell J was clearly wrong. I have closely examined her Honour’s judgment and there is no basis for so concluding. In those circumstances, I decline to depart from the construction of s.17(3) as enunciated by Bell J and apply it to the present application.

       Aggravated sexual assault without consent (s.16J, Crimes Act)

        (prior to NSWCCA reducing sentence, Cantrill CDJ had imposed sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a 9 year non-parole period) 
         
          
        (became eligible for parole on 13 May 2005; parole twice refused; full sentence expires on 13 May 2007) 
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    70 It is clear from the evidence that the defendant was serving a sentence of full-time imprisonment with the full term expiring on 13 May 2007. The offence in respect of which the defendant was charged, convicted and served his last sentence was the offence of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation: s. 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The aggravating factor in respect of that offence was that the victim was under 16 years of age at the time of the offence. The offence was punishable by imprisonment for seven years or more. Accordingly, it is clear, that, at the material date, the defendant was serving a sentence of imprisonment for “a serious sex offence” or an “offence of a sexual nature”.  
     
      
    71 An offence under s.61J of the Crimes Act is an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act. Accordingly, the definition of an “offence of a sexual nature” in s.5(2) of the Act has been satisfied. In those circumstances there was no issues that the requirements of s.14(1) of the Act have been met. 
     
      
       
      The defendant’s offences in 1985 and 1995  
       
      
    72 These two offences represent the two most serious offences committed by the defendant. The circumstances of each were summarised in the plaintiff’s written submissions dated 24 July 2007 and I reproduce below the summary in relation to each:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The 1985 offence 
       
       
        
        “59. The circumstances relating to the 1985 offences, the subject of the 1989 convictions, involved the defendant sexually assaulting a young woman who had been asleep on a country train travelling west across New South Wales. The victim was 18 years old and was previously unknown to the defendant. As McCredie DCJ recorded in his remarks on sentence, the victim had been asleep in her compartment on the train when the defendant entered and pulled her blanket down. He then grabbed or pushed her and she struck her head heavily against the side of the compartment. The defendant then required the victim to lie down and started interfering with her clothing while threatening her with violence with a clenched fist. He told the victim to undo her clothing which, in these circumstances, she partly did. He then inserted his fingers into her vagina and also forced the victim’s hand on to his penis. The defendant also required the victim to turn over and, after saying various unpleasant things to her, he attempted anal sexual intercourse. The attack stopped only when a conductor came on the scene and the defendant fled the compartment.” 
        
       
       
      (b) The 1995 offence 
       
      
    73 In the remarks on sentence, Acting Judge Cantrill, on 14 May 1998, recorded that the offence involved a 15 year old girl who had been visiting or spending time with a girlfriend at Lithgow. She had purchased something to drink and eat at a café near the railway station and proceeded to go to the toilet at the station whilst waiting for her boyfriend to arrive by train. His Honour recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “She was followed into the toilet by the accused who initially purported to offer her something called goey which I understand is a euphemism for some form of illicit drug. The young lade declined that offer and then was assaulted by the accused who firstly said to her words to the effect ‘Show us your tits then’, and proceeded to touch her on the breasts outside her clothes. 
        
       
       
        
        She tried to get away by climbing over the wall but he pulled her back and pulled her track suit pants down and her underpants and placed his hand on her genitalia, inserting his finger into her vagina. That is the sexual assault alleged, and while it is the situation as the Crown said, perhaps that it may not be the most serious in some respects of sexual assault in the sense that there was no penetration by or attempted penetration by the penis; nonetheless a woman, particularly a young girl of 15 is entitled to feel that she can safely go into a public toile on a public railway station without fear of violation or interference in any way, such as this.” 
        
       
      
    74 On 27 October 2000 the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the sentence imposed with respect to the 1995 offence. The defendant was re-sentenced to a term of nine years imprisonment with a seven-year non-parole period. 
     
      
    75 On 17 May 2005 and on 16 June 2006 the defendant was refused parole. 
     
      
       
      Factors to be considered in an application for a continuing detention order 
       
      
    76 The provisions of s.17 have been set out earlier in this judgment. It is clear, by virtue of s.17(4), that in the determination of an application for a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order the Court is required to consider nine matters as specified in s.17(4)(a) to (i) and, in addition, to “any other matters it considers relevant”. 
     
      
    77 The specific matters referred to in s.17(4) identify, inter alia, all psychiatric examinations of the offender by psychiatrists appointed under s.15(4) and “any other assessment” by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner … “as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further sex offence …”. The fact and extent of the offender’s participation in such examinations or assessments is a matter also to be taken into account. 
     
      
    78 A considerable body of evidence in the present proceedings focuses upon such “examinations” and “assessment” of the defendant himself. The evidence addressed matters that are required to be considered under the last mentioned provision. 
     
      
    79 Counsel for the plaintiff have emphasised in their submissions the criminal history of the defendant and, in particular, the nature and circumstances in which the offences occurred. Such matters fall for determination in accordance with s.17(4)(h) of the Act. In this context, emphasis was placed upon the fact that offences committed by the offender, including the last offence, occurred whilst he was on parole following the commission of previous sex offences. Before examining the evidence in relation to the defendant’s criminal history and any pattern of behaviour disclosed by that history, it is appropriate to examine relevant matters concerning the defendant himself as disclosed and analysed by the consultant psychiatrists to whom I have referred. Drs Samuels, O’Dea and Nielssen each addressed the issue of ”risk assessment” having regard to their assessment of the defendant, his history of offending, his general history including his drug and alcohol history and the issues that arise in circumstances where he is considered as being “an untreated sex offender”. 
     
      
    80 The defendant’s personality features, the nature and pattern of his criminal offending, and his underlying substance (alcohol) abuse disorder are all central to the issues of risk assessment and of risk management. Although these issues have been the subject of comment by a number of officers, in particular, psychologists employed by Corrective Services, the interrelationship between them had not been analysed as they have been by the medical specialists who have given evidence in these proceedings, the consultant psychiatrists. 
     
      
       
      Risk assessment 
       
      
    81 In February 2007, Ms Sharon Klamer, psychologist with the Department of Corrective Services prepared a Risk Assessment Report on behalf of the Commissioner of Corrective Services in anticipation of an application under the Act. The report was Exhibit 2 to her affidavit. It contains a comprehensive history of the defendant’s sexual and non-sexual offending. It notes, in terms of institutional adjustment, that the file suggested that he is a quiet and compliant inmate, although noting the defendant’s correspondence in relation to the CUBIT program and institutional convictions concerning unauthorised use of the telephone, gambling, failed urine test (8 October 2002) and refusal or fail to supply urine sample (25 January 2004). 
     
      
    82 Ms Klamer observed in her report that an offender’s acknowledgment of risk, the identification of risk factors and the development of future plans to address these risk factors, can enable an offender to reduce their likelihood of re-offending (p.9). 
     
      
    83 She considered that the defendant had very minimal insight into his sexual offending behaviour and that he failed to take full responsibility for it, primarily denying committing the offences or externalising responsibility to his alcohol abuse or the victims. Aside from alcohol abuse and relationship difficulties, Ms Klamer noted that he was unable to identify any further risk factors that led him to sexually offend. 
     
      
    84 Ms Klamer also noted the limited plans for release which she attributed to the defendant’s limited insight. He had planned to live with his fiancé, who was 18 years his junior and about which trial assessments conducted by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service indicated that she may be intellectually delayed and vulnerable. It was by reason of these concerns that accommodation for the defendant with his fiancé was not supported by the Probation and Parole Service until he had completed a sexual offender specific treatment program. The defendant, it was reported, had consistently dismissed those concerns. 
     
      
    85 Ms Klamer’s report addressed static risk factors as assessed using the actuarial risk assessment instrument, STATIC-99 and dynamic risk factors. On the basis of that assessment, she considered that the defendant was in the high risk category of sexual re-offending relative to other adult males. In this respect, she observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… an offender is able to manage his risk of re-offending by identifying his risk factors and developing management plans to address these …” 
        
       
      
    86 Ms Klamer again referred to the lack of acceptance of full responsibility and the externalisation of the responsibility and that, as a result, the defendant was currently unable to identify the risk factors that led him to sexually offend in the past. Accordingly, he has not been able to develop appropriate management plans to enable him to manage similar risk factors if they arose in the future. 
     
      
    87 Ms Klamer concluded that the defendant’s assessed risk of re-offending could be managed by participation in a program such as the CUBIT program, adding:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… given his identified risk factors, he might also benefit from further treatment of his addictive problems (alcohol and gambling), and from participation in the program to address his problems with violence, such as the Violent Offender Therapeutic Program (VOTP) …” 
        
       
      
    88 Ms Klamer observed that there was then no current treatment program available to address his high level of risk and needs in the community. 
     
      
       
      Programs and services provided to the defendant in custody 
       
      
    89 The defendant has undertaken or attended certain programs whilst in custody. In particular, in this respect:- 
     
      
       
      (a) He attended an Alcohol and Other Drug Group Program at Junee Correctional Centre. No reports were kept, the program having been conducted by inmates. 
       
       
      (b) He has had several one to one sessions in relation to alcohol related issues. 
       
       
      (c) He attended a Relapse Prevention Course. 
       
       
      (d) On 17 March 2003, as earlier noted, the defendant entered the CUBIT program until his discharge from it on 5 May 2003. (The catalyst for his removal from the program is recorded as having apparently been an incident where he is reported to have threatened another group member and the defendant requested that he be discharged.) 
       
      
    90 According to a report from the Parole Service, South West Region, 17 February 1994, the defendant had, at no time up to that time, seen a psychologist. The report records that at no time had the defendant committed himself to a long-term rehabilitation program and that, whilst he expressed a desire to make a life for himself in the community, he had not really addressed many of his past a recurring problems, namely, his abuse of alcohol and his repetitive assaults on females. The report added (Exhibit CJV-1(7), p.1540):- 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that there is a need for some kind of treatment program that could provide for his abuse of alcohol and his anti-social behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    91 A counsellor’s report dated 13 March 1994 recorded that the defendant had enrolled in a drug and alcohol group commencing 28 January 1994. The group was focused on “relapse prevention and ran for a duration of seven, one and a half hourly sessions. The defendant’s contribution to the group was reported as being ‘positive’ and extended to convincing at least one inmate of the value of such group sessions and recruiting him to a subsequent group” (Exhibit CJV-1(7), p.1544). That report included reference to the fact that the defendant’s post-release plans included enrolling in the Alcoholics Anonymous group at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney. 
     
      
    92 On 22 February 1994, the defendant participated at Junee Correctional Centre in the previously mentioned small alcohol counselling groups conducted by the Centre and was due to complete those groups in four weeks’ time. His attendance was reported as being “excellent” and that he was “committed to the program”. 
     
      
    93 On 31 March 1994, it was reported that the defendant had completed successfully an eight week drug and alcohol counselling program (Exhibit CJV-1(7), p.1542). 
     
      
    94 File records reveal that the defendant had a realisation or understanding of the connection between alcohol consumption and his offending (see, by way of example, Exhibit CJV-1(7), p.559, supplementary licence report dated 13 May 1983). 
     
      
       
      Defendant’s history of failure to comply with parole conditions 
       
      
    95 The plaintiff’s submissions emphasised the history as to past breaches of parole conditions by the defendant. That, of course, is an important matter in risk evaluation, as Dr O’Dea, amongst others, acknowledged in the course of his evidence.  
     
      
    96 The defendant’s conduct in committing serious offences whilst on parole bears directly upon the issue of his likely compliance with an extended supervision order if made under s.9 of the Act. It is a matter that the Court must have regard to in accordance with s.17(4)(f) of the Act. It, in particular, is relevant in determining the adequacy of supervision under an extended supervision order, for the history of offending whilst on parole suggests that the required level of trust in the defendant complying with any conditions imposed by an extended supervision order may not, at least at present, be achievable.  
     
      
    97 The affidavit of Joanne Kennedy, Acting Assistant Director of the Offender Policy Unit within the Department of Corrective Services, sworn on 5 June 2007, states that the offender has had a history of offending whilst on parole. According to a pre-release report dated 23 March 2005:- 
     
      
       
      • The offences of sexual intercourse without consent x 2 committed on 28 November 1985 occurred during a parole period in respect of an earlier offence that commenced on 12 April 1984 and which was due to expire on 7 April 1986. 
       
       
      • On 14 May 1998, the defendant was sentenced for the offence of aggravated sexual assault without consent (committed on 23 December 1995), the details of which have been set out earlier in this judgment. The offence occurred during the parole period which was due to expire on 1 February 1996. The sentence imposed was reduced on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal to nine years with a non-parole period of seven years. 
       
      
    98 Subsequently, release to parole was not recommended by Ms Kennedy in her reports dated 23 March 2005, 14 April 2006, 7 June 2006 and 16 June 2006. 
     
      
    99 The plaintiff’s written submissions refer to the defendant’s history of breaches of parole conditions and of his conviction on non-sexual offences during the period he was on bail pending the hearing of the last offence. In that respect, it was submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “137. These factors strongly suggest that the defendant would be unlikely to comply with any conditions imposed as part of any order for extended supervision and point to such an alternative order being inappropriate for the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    100 As the Crown Advocate submitted, a fundamental issue on the question of the effectiveness of any proposed conditions to an extended supervision order is that concerning likely compliance. On the history of the defendant’s parole breaches and offending, he submitted there are plainly grounds for a very significant doubt as to the likelihood of the defendant complying with any such conditions. Additionally, there was no evidence from the defendant in the present proceedings as to his commitment and confidence on the question of compliance. 
     
      
    101 The plaintiff’s submission was that the sex offences committed by the defendant had been brazenly committed against young women in public places. It was contended that it would be very difficult to provide any meaningful protection of the community by way of conditions under an extended supervision order. 
     
      
       
      The assessment undertaken by the consultant psychiatrists 
       
      
    102 I was impressed by Dr Samuels, both in terms of his detailed analysis as expressed in his report and in his oral evidence given on 17 June 2007. His examination and assessment focused upon the factors associated with the defendant’s offending pattern (which include details of the offences, the ages of the victims, the circumstances of the offences and historical or other source data available to him). He considered both relevant risk factors and made his own clinical assessment. 
     
      
    103 Dr Samuels cautioned that all forms of risk assessment are subject to inherent limitations in terms of predicting future dangerousness of offenders. He stated that such assessments are somewhat imprecise and a number of factors can affect the question of prediction. He observed that the validity and reliability of prediction was increased by the use of structured professional judgment which incorporates clinical guidelines, anamnestic methods (the historical examination of risk factors associated with the relevant offending pattern) and actuarial tools. 
     
      
    104 Dr Samuels concluded that he regarded the defendant “…as being at moderate to high risk of further sexual offences, particularly if he continues to abuse alcohol” (Report p.18). Dr Nielssen observed that the risk assessment instruments as they have been applied to the defendant … “are in my view unable to predict whether he will commit a further offence to a high enough degree of probability to warrant preventative detention on the basis of the findings of those scales.” 
     
      
    105 Dr O’Dea considered that the defendant should be considered as having a significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours (paragraph 56 of his report). He noted in this respect that this risk would be related “…to a number of parameters, in particular his alcohol and other drug use in the community and the presence of sexually deviant urges or sexually deviant fantasies” (paragraph 56 of his report). 
     
      
    106 Dr Samuels did not approach the subject of risk assessment and risk management as separate issues, but saw them as related. He stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        it is all very well to say someone is high risk or low risk or moderate risk. The real purpose of making a risk assessment is to say, if you can put in place a risk management plan. It really means nothing, moderate or high. It is really … there is an identifiable risk and what can we do about it.”  
        (Transcript, 17 July 2007 p. 58.45-50) 
        
       
      
    107 Similarly, in his discussion of dynamic risk factors and other risk factors he identified (p.15 of his report) (including the issue of violence and its pattern of escalation) the main purpose of the “Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol” was to “… highlight these risk factors in order to target interventions” (Report p.15). 
     
      
    108 Dr Samuels commented upon his scoring of the defendant on a range of items in terms of the Psychopathy Check List. He considered the defendant by an application of the actuarial tool relevant to static risk factors to have at least some psychopathic traits in his personality, a risk factor in all types of offending. Other aspects revealed limited insight, impulsivity, the need for stimulation through alcohol abuse, manipulative behaviour – all of which he took into account in evaluating risk factors. He suspected that there is a paraphilic component to the defendant’s offending behaviour, however, it was difficult for him to give a definitive opinion in that regard. 
     
      
    109 Dr Nielssen stated, having regard to the defendant’s history of conduct and pattern of offending that he met the criteria of “anti-social personality disorder”. He also observed that he meets the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of an alcohol abuse disorder. In oral evidence he stated that “… alcohol is his main risk factor” (transcript p.136, lines 15 – 20), adding that he has had “… a pretty serious alcohol abuse disorder …” noting, according to the history given to him by the defendant that nearly all of his offences and all of his sexual offences had occurred whilst affected by alcohol (transcript p.136, lines 15 – 20). He emphasised that appropriate intervention by way of a treatment program should seek to deal with his alcohol abuse disorder as the main issue in terms of the future management the identified risk, adding:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        and whatever can be done to reduce relapsed alcohol abuse will, I believe, greatly reduce the risk of further offences.”  
        (transcript p. 141, lines 21- 30) 
        
       
      
    110 Dr Samuels noted the defendant’s lengthy history of conduct disorder and anti-social history and its relevance:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In terms of Mr Quinn, he has had some employment from time to time, he doesn’t really have an, I suppose, a life plan and in terms of where to from here. He plans to live with is fiancée but he doesn’t have a very clear plan. I suppose, in terms of addressing the sexual offending behaviour as far as I can see, addressing the alcohol abuse. He feels the alcohol abuse is under control but there really is limited, I suppose, evidence to say that it is. So …, I felt that he was somewhat unrealistic in terms of where he was, how he was proposing to manage his situation in the community given his past history. 
        ” (Transcript 17 July 2007 at p. 57) 
        
       
      
    111 In terms of his past offending, he noted that some of his sex offending had been opportunistic and that he had been in an intoxicated state when the victim’s presence at a particular point of time coincided with his, adding, “…and the offending occurred. I don’t think it is planned or premeditated. I think it is … impulsive …” 
     
      
       
      The defendant’s alcohol abuse disorder 
       
      
    112 In both his report and in his oral evidence Dr Samuels identified the role alcohol abuse has played in the defendant’s criminal history. It was, similarly, a key factor in determining the defendant’s assessed risk of re-offending. The Crown Advocate asked him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You would see alcohol as a major prognostic feature to his risk of re-offending? A. I would see it as being a key factor in offending. I believe that when he becomes intoxicated he becomes less inhibited and acts in an aggressive manner. Sometimes sexually, sometimes in a generally violent manner, but alcohol seems to be a very important mediator of the aggression 
        .” 
        
       
      
    113 This theme of the causal interrelationship between the defendant’s alcohol abuse disorder and his past sexual behaviour and aggressiveness is evident throughout Dr Samuels’ analysis. He was asked by the Crown Advocate whether the defendant remained at a high risk of a relapse of alcohol abuse, having regard, in particular, to its remission whilst in custody. He confirmed that he considered that there remained a high risk of a relapse:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q That is taking into account his chronic history? A. Yes, and the fact that he has, appears to have slipped back into a pattern of alcohol use fairly quickly after being released from incarceration.”  
        
       
      
    114 In commenting upon his risk assessment Dr Samuels emphasised the opportunistic and impulsive nature of his past offending, observing that it could take months or even years before a set of circumstances emerged in which the defendant was intoxicated in combination with other circumstances. However, he also stated that it is certainly possible that the defendant could be released from custody and nothing could happen for a prolonged period or never (transcript 17 July 2007 at p.27, lines 45 – 50). He once again emphasised the alcohol disorder and its potential role:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… but certainly based on history, based on his personality structure, based on his risk of – and I would see it, as I’ve said before, I think alcohol has been a critical mediator of all of this, based on whether or not he drinks again, and that, that taking all of those factors into account that he is, and I would say more than … medium risk but not quite, not absolutely high …” 
         (transcript p. 57, lines 50 – 60) 
        
       
      
    115 Dr Samuels stated in his report:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Mr Quinn has a history of severe alcohol abuse since his teenage years. His general criminality and sexual offending appears to be related to his substance misuse. In my view he remains at high risk of relapse of alcohol abuse. I would see this as a major prognostic factor in terms of all types of future offending 
        .” (Report p. 17) 
        
       
      
    116 In cross-examination by Mr Austin, Dr Samuels confirmed that the alcohol abuse problem was “an integral component of his offending”.  
     
      
    117 The evidence established that the defendant has undertaken some alcohol counselling programs or courses whilst in custody. However, Dr Samuels agreed when it was put to him by Mr Austin that the fact that he had undertaken such alcohol counselling in custody would not change his opinion “… that he needs supervision in relation to alcohol, certainly upon any release into the community, if his risk of re-offending is to be reduced” (transcript 17 July 2007 at p. 67, lines 40 – 45). 
     
      
    118 Dr O’Dea also considered that the defendant’s offending was consistent with anti-social personality traits and that his general personality “is likely to have been significantly impacted upon by his alcohol and other drug use in the circumstances of his incarcerations” (paragraph 55 of his report). 
     
      
    119 Dr O’Dea stated that he tied the defendant’s alcohol abuse to his offending behaviour (quote p.97). He considered it appropriate for there to be a program to deal with the defendant’s alcohol problem, including the use of appropriate medication to control the urge to drink alcohol. He also stated that “psychotherapeutic interventions” could be implemented by way of treatment programs involving both psychiatrists and psychologists and other healthcare professionals, the intervention of psychologists being based on the cognitive behavioural therapeutic approach which is available in the community. The doctor considered that the defendant would only have limited benefit from “psychological treatment alone”. 
     
      
    120 Dr O’Dea stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In my view I think the key intervention is going to be abstinence from alcohol as a key thing to reduce his risk …”  
        (transcript 17 July 2007 p. 90, lines 25 – 28) 
        
       
      
    121 Dr O’Dea was asked:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Is it your view that a person who does have a history of chronic alcohol abuse needs to, in order to overcome the problem, engage in more than mere abstinence, but needs to have some sort of treatment, therapy or assistance of some kind? 
        
       
       
        
         A. The short answer is for a lot of people yes. I don’t think for everybody but I think a lot of people and I certainly I think Mr Quinn would fit into that group” 
         (transcript 17 July 2005 p. 95, lines 53 – 55) 
        
       
      
    122 Dr O’Dea referred to treatment and other support mechanisms including particular medications that are designed to control the craving for alcohol and involvement in organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous. 
     
      
    123 He stated that the “key issue” was going to be the defendant’s “motivation to stop himself drinking” and that “… what’s going to be important is him marshalling his own will power to remain abstinent from alcohol and that’s going to be the key issue” (transcript 101, lines 5 –15). He added that a treating psychiatrist would be in an ideal situation to monitor his ability to resist alcohol and, if necessary, to offer medication to assist him. (transcript p.101) He agreed, when it was put to him, “… this key risk factor is becoming intoxicated and potentially disinhibited and offending in those circumstances” (transcript p.101, lines 40 – 45). 
     
      
    124 Mr Austin put to Dr O’Dea:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … The most significant matter that needs to be dealt with in your opinion is past alcohol dependence and abuse, and it is your opinion that if he were not to be abusing alcohol in the community his potential for re-offending in the community drops significantly, he is at far less of a risk to offend if he is not abusing alcohol. 
        
       
       
        
        A. I think I would accept that. It is very difficult to be precise about far less. I think it is likely to have a significant impact upon his risk of re-offending.” 
         (transcript p. 101, lines 50 – 102.1) 
        
       
      
    125 He added that a treating psychiatrist could prescribe the required medication in relation to both problems but the need for such medication would better show itself during the course of therapy. He indicated that a psychiatrist experienced in those two areas would be the person to assess the need for medication assisted treatment. The issue of consent to medication may flow from a condition of release that required the defendant to subject himself to treatment as and when directed by a treating psychiatrist. 
     
      
    126 Dr Nielssen, like Dr Samuels and Dr O’Dea, related the defendant’s risk of further offending to his future use of alcohol, noting that his adherence to a condition of abstinence could be assisted by a prescription of anti-craving medication such as Acamprosate (Campral) and Naltrexone (Revia). He further observed that the consumption of alcohol can be readily monitored by a newly available test, Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT). He observed that, by reason of the defendant’s impulsive personality, he was more at risk of acting on impulse when uninhibited by alcohol:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I believe his risk of further offences, particularly offences of a sexual nature, is directly related to his future alcohol use.”  
        (Report 19 June 2007, p. 7) 
        
       
      
    127 In his written submissions (p.10), Mr Austin submitted that Ms Klamer had expressed her opinion that the defendant externalises his responsibility for sexual offending behaviour to alcohol abuse and to his victims, but that this was the only reference that she made to alcohol. He submitted that there was no suggestion that abstinence from alcohol would play any part in a risk minimisation strategy for the defendant. 
     
      
    128 Mr Austin correctly submitted (p.10):- 
     
      
       
        
        “8. The clear evidence of Dr Samuels and Dr O’Dea is that the abuse of alcohol has played a significant role in all of Mr Quinn’s past criminal offending. This covers the range of offences sexual and non-sexual nature. They are both of the opinion that minimising any risk of Mr Quinn committing a further sexual offence upon release into the community is dependent upon him continuing to abstain from alcohol consumption. They both suggest that appropriate treatment for his underlining (sic) personality disorder would be available in the community the ongoing counselling of, for example, a supervising psychiatrist. The real concern is that Mr Quinn presents a serious risk of re-offending if upon his release he returns to his past lifestyle of alcohol abuse.” 
        
       
      
    129 Mr Austin further submitted (p.11):- 
     
      
       
        
        “9. It is significant that in Dr O’Dea’s opinion there is nothing that could be done in custody to ameliorate the risk that upon release into the community Mr Quinn will return to the use and abuse of alcohol in those changed circumstances. The danger that Mr Quinn may begin to consume alcohol upon release into the community is the central consideration in the opinion of all the psychiatrists. It is this concern upon which the opinion that there is a serious risk that Mr Quinn may commit a further sexual offence upon release is based. In view of this any further participation in the CUBIT program is of little relevance when considering risk minimisation upon release.” 
        
       
       
      The CUBIT program 
       
      
    130 The custody-based intensive treatment program (CUBIT) is described as a high intensity, prison-based therapeutic program for male sex offenders. It is designed to minimise the risk of such persons re-offending when they are released from prison. According to evidence given by Mr Bright, forensic psychologist and Therapeutic Manager of the CUBIT program, the fundamental principle upon which it is premised is that the intensity of the treatment should match the risk at which the offender has been assessed. The program involves full-time residence in a therapeutic environment that includes group-based therapy sessions in addition to ongoing homework tasks and input from specially trained custodial staff who provide supervision and ongoing support. The program is designed for sex offenders with a moderate to high risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    131 Offenders admitted to the program are accommodated in a special, self-contained 40-bed unit located in the Metropolitan Special Program Centre at Long Bay Correctional Centre. The first intake into the program occurred in 1999. 
     
      
    132 Offenders who enter the program practise newly acquired skills, behaviours and attitudes with feedback and advice from trained psychologists and custodial officers. The program runs, on average, for about eight months although the precise length of the course would depend upon the progress of an individual participant. The new program is described in a document entitled “Institutional Programs for Sexual Offenders, CUBIT, Core and Custodial Maintenance” Exhibit DA1 (tab 9 to the affidavit of Mr Bright). Dr Samuels commented that the CUBIT program is a traditional cognitive behaviour therapy program, which looked at understanding the offence cycle, victim empathy, relapse and other issues. He stated that it adds in the component of social skills, training and addresses issues of anger management and alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    133 Mr Bright’s evidence was that group therapy is almost universally recognised as the treatment modality of choice with sexual offenders. The majority of such treatment programs are run using a cognitive behavioural approach in a group format. He did observe, however, that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        … however, it should be noted that despite sound theoretical rationales for employing group therapy rather than individual therapy, and despite the preference for group therapy among the majority of sexual offender treatment providers, there is little evidence of differential treatment efficacy with adult sexual offenders …” 
         (paragraph 36 of the affidavit of Mr Bright sworn on 2 May 2007). 
        
       
      
    134 Mr Bright also referred to studies which indicated that there was no significant difference in the rate of recidivism between two groups of comparable high risk sexual offenders who underwent a combination of group and individual treatment or individual treatment alone. 
     
      
    135 Mr Bright further stated that the formation of meaningful interpersonal relationships is recognised as one of the main “curative factors” of group therapy. In paragraph 41 of his affidavit, he identified the reasons why group based interventions for sexual offenders are preferred to individual interventions. The evidence, accordingly, does establish the benefits that may be derived from a program such as CUBIT. However, the evidence also leaves open the prospect that individualised treatment can, in the hands of a skilled psychiatrist or psychologist, produce results that reduce the risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    136 Mr Bright also emphasised that the final component of the CUBIT treatment program puts together a self-management plan for the offender which is designed to help him manage his risk of re-offending. This last component of the program is critical in terms of treatment progress and effective risk management of the offender. 
     
      
    137 Mr Bright’s opinion was that treatment for high risk sexual offenders is, in his view, likely to be ineffective when an offender starts but does not complete a program. He also observed that research supports the proposition that treatment is ineffective when a person starts but does not complete a treatment program such as CUBIT. That is an observation that has potential application to the defendant who commenced the program in 2003 but withdrew from it. 
     
      
       
      Application of the CUBIT program to the defendant 
       
      
    138 The evidence called by the plaintiff addressed the potential benefits of the program to the defendant. 
     
      
    139 The defendant, according to Mr Bright, was classified by the Department as a high risk sexual offender which meant, according to Mr Bright, that he was assessed as being “… of a high risk of sexual recidivism …”. The defendant’s current sentence was due to expire, as earlier noted, on 13 May 2007. 
     
      
    140 Mr Bright performed a risk assessment on the defendant and he identified documentation utilised for that purpose (paragraph 10). He explained that a fundamental principle upon which the CUBIT and DCS Sexual Offender Treatment Programs are premised, is that the intensity of the treatment program should match the risk at which the offender has been assessed. In this respect, he stated that high risk offenders, such as he suggested was an apt description of the defendant, should receive high intensity treatment.  
     
      
    141 The evidence indicates that the treatment afforded by these programs should address the “… criminogenic needs or dynamic risk factors of the offender …” (paragraph 17). The aim of such treatment is to reduce the likelihood of recidivism by changing those dynamic risk factors. 
     
      
    142 According to Mr Bright (paragraph 24):- 
     
      
       
        
        “During the program, and as an essential part of their treatment, participants are expected to take responsibility for their offending behaviour, examine victim issues, identify their offence cycle, and develop a detailed relapse prevention program. During the treatment program, one of the first tasks that an offender needs to undertake is to discuss (‘disclose’) all of their sexual offending behaviour. Acknowledging and taking responsibility for offending behaviour can be positive experience for offenders and helps in identifying risk factors.” 
        
       
      
    143 The participants in the program are expected, whilst remaining in a custom-build environment, to be working on the new skills that they are learning for the whole period of their confinement. 
     
      
    144 Mr Bright explained in his affidavit what he termed “the new CUBIT program” (Exhibit DAB1, Tab 9 to his affidavit, paragraph 28 of his affidavit). This refers to the introduction of “a maintenance program” which is held one morning per week. This component of the course is said to include “… streamlining and improvement of self-management programs for each offender which addresses his dynamic risk factors …” (paragraph 30). 
     
      
    145 CUBIT, as I understand the evidence, employs a cognitive behavioural approach in a group format. Mr Bright explained that sexual offending involves behaviour in which sexual offenders tend to demonstrate pervasive deficits and distortions in interpersonal relationships. Accordingly, so Mr Bright contended, group treatment “… is a highly beneficial modality …” (paragraph 37). He stated that acquiring new ways of thinking and interpersonal behaviour group processes have advantages over traditional individual treatment. 
     
      
    146 He stated that group based approaches represent a way of countering the isolation and alienation that is often experienced by sexual offenders (paragraph 39). 
     
      
        
      
    147 Dr Samuels reported on the defendant’s mental status examination and he specifically addressed issues concerning risk assessment at pp.14-15 of his report. He observed that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The defendant expressed some contrition in regard to the sexual assault on the train (1985) but basically denied his current offence and justified previous offences. He observed, in this respect:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… I thought that there was shallow affect; callousness and lack of empathy; poor behavioural controls; early behavioural problems; lack of realistic long-term goals; impulsivity; irresponsibility; failure to accept responsibility for own actions; juvenile delinquency; revocation of conditional release and criminal versatility.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The defendant scored 25 on the PCL-R (Psychopathy Check List – Revised). He stated that that was a conservative estimate and he observed (at p.14):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “A significant component of his score is derived from ‘factor 4’ – antisocial behaviours (juvenile delinquency; revocation of conditional release and criminal versatility) and ‘factor 3’ – affective (lack of remorse; shallow affect; callous; failure to accept responsibility). This suggests a significant antisocial component to his personality.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) Dr Samuels re-scored the defendant on the STATIC-99 and concurred with Ms Klamer’s score that Mr Quinn scored at least nine. 
       
       
      (d) On the SORAG (Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide), the defendant was scored between 25 to 30 on the basis of not having lived with biological parents until 16, elementary school maladjustment, history of alcohol problems, marital status at time of offence, criminal history, failure on prior conditional release, age at index offence and score of 25 to 34 on PPCL-R. That score rated the probability of violent recidivism at seven years as being 0.75. 
       
       
      (e) In relation to dynamic risk factors, the defendant had a number of such factors including “a chronic pattern of sexual violence (at least 20 years); escalation of sexual violence; physical coercion in sexual violence; psychological coercion in sexual violence; extreme minimisation of sexual violence; attitudes that condone sexual violence; psychopathic personality disorder; problems with substance use; violent ideation; problems with intimate relationships; problems with employment; non-sexual criminality; problems with supervision” (p.15). 
       
       
      (f) The defendant’s pattern of sexual offending, in keeping with that of a  
      “rapist” 
      , was the need for power, control and subjugation of the victim being paramount. He added (at p.15):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… his crimes appear to have been opportunistic and alcohol a disinhibitor. His choice of adolescent female victim may well relate to a perception that a young girl may be less inclined to fight back or resist his attack.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (g) He was unable to identify evidence to suggest any major mental illness in the form of an affective, anxiety or psychotic disorder. He said that the defendant had features which were suggestive of “Conduct Disorder” as an adolescent and “Antisocial Personality” features as an adult. 
       
       
      (h) There are inherent limitations in all forms of risk assessment purporting to predict future dangerousness of offenders. A review of sex offender treatment literature, treatment indicated variable outcomes and participant selection is a critical factor. He added that the defendant’s resistance to treatment may well be significant in terms of risk of future recidivism, adding that  
      “… coerced participation in the CUBIT program will not necessarily reduce his overall risk” 
       (p.17). 
       
       
      (i) The defendant had a moderate to high risk of sexual re-offending. He related his substantive criminal history, being one involving violence, to the defendant’s history of serious alcohol problems and antisocial personality features. 
       
       
      (j) In relation to the defendant’s substance misuse, Dr Samuels added (p.17):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… in my view, he remains at high risk of relapse of alcohol abuse. I would see this as a major prognostic factor in terms of all types of future offending.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    148 Dr Samuels observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        … I think continuing detention for the sole purpose of doing the CUBIT program is in my view unlikely to significantly alter his risk status. There may well be some rationale for detaining him in custody for other purposes. 
        ” (transcript 17 July 2007 p. 70, lines 5 –10) 
        
       
      
    149 Dr Samuels again stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        but in my view for the sole purpose of detaining him to complete the CUBIT program I see very limited benefit and I believe that at the end of completing that program we will be sitting in this courtroom looking at the same issues, because it will be very difficult to say that his risk has materially changed.”  
        (transcript 17 July 2007 p.70, lines 30 – 40) 
        
       
      
    150 Dr Samuels’ additional observations included the following:- 
     
      
       
      • He did not see a very clear rationale for detaining the defendant solely for the purpose of completing the CUBIT program. 
       
       
      • If the defendant undertook the program, that in itself would not necessarily lead to a material change in his risk of re-offending. 
       
       
      • At some point in time the position would be reached when he would be released into the community and the question would be whether provision is to be put in place to reduce the likelihood of future re-offending. 
       
      
    151 As Dr O’Dea understood it, the CUBIT program was not specifically directed at alcohol and other drug management issues (transcript 17 July 2007, page 95, lines 10 – 12). Other evidence indicated that components of the program, at least, address those matters, but not in terms of a supervised medical program. 
     
      
    152 The defendant entered the CUBIT program on 17 March 2003 but was discharged from it on 5 May 2003. He had twice been suspended from the program and on 5 May 2003, requested that he be able to leave the program. He was discharged on the basis of his request together with his poor treatment progress to that point in time. 
     
      
    153 On 16 August 2006, the defendant wrote inquiring about re-entry into the program (Exhibit DAB-1 to Mr Bright’s affidavit). 
     
      
    154 Between 29 August 2006 and 6 October 2006 there was correspondence which was tendered in evidence between the defendant and Mr Bright. In his letter dated 14 September 2006, the defendant confirmed that he wished to re-enter the program but made it clear that he would not be prepared to admit his guilt in respect of the last offence. He sought agreement to his re-entry on this basis. Mr Bright stated that he read Mr Quinn as seeking to dictate and impose conditions upon his proposed re-entry to CUBIT. 
     
      
    155 Further correspondence ensued on this matter between October and November 2006. Mr Bright stated that the defendant’s letter still raised issues of concern regarding his readiness to undertake treatment in accordance with the disclosure obligations in the CUBIT program. By November he stated the defendant would have had insufficient time to undertake and complete the program before the expiry of his then current sentence in May 2007. 
     
      
    156 I will return to the issue of the defendant’s participation, in any, in the CUBIT program at some point in the future. 
     
      
       
      Extended supervision 
       
      
    157 Dr Samuels addressed the alternatives of continued detention and extended supervision. In relation to the former, he noted that such detention would provide the defendant with an opportunity to complete the CUBIT program and for more suitable accommodation to be found, although expressing reservations, as noted above, about the value of such intervention. In this respect, he emphasised “… as I have already highlighted, even if Mr Quinn completes the CUBIT program and is then regarded as a ‘treated’ sex-offender, his level of risk may not in fact be substantially reduced”. 
     
      
    158 In relation to the issue of extended supervision, Dr Samuels stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This (extended supervision) would, in my view, be the key to reducing his medium to long-term risk of re-offending and should incorporate the following elements:- 
        
       
       
        
        1. A period of placement in a supervised accommodation setting (not to live initially with fiancée); 
        
       
       
        
        2. Follow-up with a psychiatrist with ext with expertise in dealing with sex offenders. (Some suitable experts would include Prof D Greenberg, Dr S Allnutt and Dr J O’Dea.) This would allow further and ongoing assessment of a possible paraphilic component and further consideration of the role of anti-androgen medication; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Abstinence from alcohol and mandatory attendance for drug and alcohol treatment in the community. 
        
       
       
        
        4. To be placed on sex offender register; 
        
       
       
        
        5. To have a curfew in place; 
        
       
       
        
        6. To have restrictions placed on travel; 
        
       
       
        
        7. Daily reporting requirements; 
        
       
       
        
        8. Not to be in company of females under the age of 17 unsupervised; 
        
       
       
        
        9. Random alcohol breath tests; 
        
       
       
        
        10. Outpatient monitoring follow-up via community sex offender treatment program and possibly follow-up via Justice Health Community Forensic Mental Health tem led by Dr Andrew Ellis which is providing some supervision and monitoring of sex offenders; 
        
       
       
        
        11. Any alcohol related offence, violent offence of any kind or public intoxication to be regarded as breach of conditions.” 
        
       
      
    159 Dr Nielssen, in oral evidence, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        … I would agree largely with the management plan suggested by Dr Samuels. Obviously the largest risk factor in this individual’s case is alcohol abuse and so the first measure that will be required will be some way of monitoring continued abstinence from alcohol. It will also be recommended that he have individual counselling after release to ensure or at least to raise issues relating to any relationships he may have.”  
        (transcript p. 137) 
        
       
      
    160 He stated that individual counselling by a psychologist or psychiatrist with specialised experience in sexual offending would be recommended. Most psychiatrists, he observed, would have some experience in drug and alcohol abuse problems. Dr Nielssen agreed that to contemplate the defendant’s return to the community there would firstly be a requirement to assess how his alcohol abuse disorder was to be managed and that, in turn, would require the input from a psychiatrist or other specialist experienced in the treatment of alcohol abuse disorders. The purpose of the assessment would be to determine appropriate treatment based on both cognitive behavioural therapy and to assess treatment requirements, including, in particular, anti-craving medication. An aspect of a rehabilitation plan, Dr Nielssen also observed, would involve assistance to the defendant in the development of a “life plan” which would include his placement, initially, in voluntary work, if paid work were not immediately available, as an antecedent step or progression to paid work, and assistance in securing appropriately supervised accommodation upon release. 
     
      
    161 In the Defendant’s Outline of Submissions, p.15, the following submission was made:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court may finally determine that Mr Quinn is likely (in the ordinary sense of the word) to commit a further serious sex offence if he is released into the community in circumstances where he is under no supervision and receiving no assistance in relation to his issues around the abuse of alcohol. The community certainly would be protected if an appropriate extended supervision order were in place. He should not be subjected to a further five year period of incarceration and the Court should consider orders which would allow for the necessary factors to be in place upon his release which would allow him to comply with a supervision order which would be consistent with the type of order envisaged by Dr Samuels and considered appropriate by Dr O’Dea and Dr Nielssen.” 
        
       
      
    162 In his oral submissions, Mr Austin emphasised:- 
     
      
       
      • The independent medical evidence had  
      “shifted the focus” 
       of the proceedings to that which was available at the time of the hearing at which the interim detention order was sought. 
       
       
      • On the assumption that I were to follow and apply Bell J in the construction of s.17(3) of the Act ( 
      Tillman’s 
       case (supra)), it was difficult for him to submit that, on the evidence, the defendant was not  
      “… likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he … is not kept under supervision” 
      : (s.17(3)). He submitted the position is otherwise if  
      “likely” 
       in s.17(3) has the meaning he contended for. 
       
       
      • The medical evidence would support a conclusion that adequate supervision can be provided by an extended supervision order and that such an order should be made. 
       
       
      • The evidence of Dr Nielssen suggested that he was a person who could, in co-operation with prison authorities, assist in the provision of appropriate accommodation for the defendant and the involvement of a person responsible for administering appropriate therapy or treatment. 
       
       
      • If the Court concluded that an appropriate supervisory regime could be put in place, then it should only make an order for continued detention for a relatively short period of time. That would carry with it the expectation that there would be a further application under the Act by the Attorney General. By the time that application was heard, evidence may be available which would indicate that an extended supervision order could then be implemented. 
       
       
      • The establishment of an adequate supervisory regime following assessment of all relevant factors could constitute changed circumstances sufficient to warrant the making of an extended supervision order upon the expiration of a continuing detention order that operates for a limited term. 
       
       
      Post-release support and supervision issues 
       
       
      (a) Available support services in the community 
       
      
    163 Until recently the evidence indicates that there has been little by way of progress for high-risk sex offenders in the community. Currently, the Corrective Services Sex Offender Program does not offer a high risk program in the community. Dr Samuels indicated there was “a range of other providers in that there are a number of psychiatrists who do see sex offenders in the community through Medicare” (p. 74, lines 50 – 55). Dr Samuels indicated that through the extension of medical benefits to psychologists presumably all programs run by psychologists would also be available. He confirmed that there were currently no community-based programs available for high risk six offenders. 
     
      
    164 On the last day of the hearing (26 July 2007) the Crown Advocate tendered Exhibit O, which is a letter written by Mr Weir, dated 25 July 2007, advising that the position as related by him in evidence had changed. The letter refers to the fact that the Department of Corrective Services recognised the need to develop a high intensity treatment program in the community. The Commissioner had approved the creation of two full-time psychologists’ positions for the purpose of using those two positions to create a community-based high intensity sex offender treatment program. The program is not likely to be operational in the community for at least six months. 
     
      
       
      (b) Developing a management plan for future supervision 
       
      
    165 Mr Austin, in his final submissions, correctly, in my opinion, emphasised the need to look ahead to the development of a management plan along the lines recommended by Dr Samuels that will provide the support and safeguards required for the defendant’s release. Efforts that are properly directed to custodial programs and treatment in custody are essential but not alone sufficient. Any continuing detention order must operate upon the basis that the detention will prepare the offender for release. The development of a management plan (discussed below) is essential. 
     
      
    166 Dr O’Dea stated, on the subject of a management plan to operate after release: - 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        in a structured and supervised management program on Mr Quinn’s release to the community, including specific focus on assisting him to control his use of alcohol and other drugs and to control any sexually deviant urges or sexually deviant fantasies, is likely to be more appropriate from a risk perspective and is likely to prove more effective 
         …” (paragraph 59 of his report) 
         
        
       
      
    167 The evidence of Dr Samuels casts doubt upon the extent of the benefits, that the defendant may obtain from participating in the CUBIT program in circumstances in which the key issue concerning his alcohol abuse disorder is not properly treated as a medical problem. Whilst the evidence of the psychologists relied upon by the plaintiff suggests that he could benefit (Mr Ware‘s evidence was that the CUBIT program is apt to be able to assist an offender with an alcohol abuse disorder), there remains the important question as whether the CUBIT program alone would be sufficient or adequate in reducing and managing the defendant’s risk of re-offending. Dr Samuels stated in this respect:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… my concern about detaining him in custody for the purpose of a psychological treatment program is that I am not certain that at the end of completion of that program, even if he has a certificate in his hand, his risk profile will have changed.” 
         (transcript 17 July 2007 at p. 68, lines 25 – 30)  
        
       
       
      The issues of “risk” and “rehabilitation” 
       
      
    168 The evidence relied upon by the plaintiff was principally directed to the issue of the “risk” of the defendant re-offending by committing sex offences if released from custody and upon the issue of the CUBIT program and the benefit that it may bring to the defendant in terms of his assessed risk of sex offending. A number of aspects of those two principal issues were explored in evidence. 
     
      
    169 The evidence strongly supports the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The defendant’s history of sex offences and his assessed future risk of committing such offences in the future is related to both an antisocial personality disorder and to his alcohol abuse disorder. 
       
       
      (b) The alcohol abuse disorder has been in remission for many years whilst he has been in custody. Alcohol abuse has a historical causative link in the defendant’s past history of sex offending. Drs Samuels, O’Dea and Nielssen all share the opinion that the risk of future offending is directly related to any relapse leading to the use of alcohol and that is a  
      “key” 
       issue affecting the future risk of offending and his prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
       
      (c) In order to reduce the assessed risk referred to in (a) and (b), there is a need to support the defendant’s prospects of rehabilitation by therapy and related assistance which targets both the personality disorder that is related to a propensity for sex offending (eg., by the CUBIT program) and his alcohol abuse disorder which is presently in remission by appropriate therapy or treatment (in particular, by means of a psychiatrist-supervised program that addresses addiction propensities which are susceptible to relapse). 
       
       
      (d) The evidence in the plaintiff’s application addressed the first (personality issues related to his sex offending), but not the second (the strategy to prevent a relapse of his substance abuse disorder). 
       
       
      (e) Whilst the defendant has undergone alcohol counselling courses in custody (see the schedule entitled  
      “Some References to DCS Documents (and DSC psychologists) and Quinn and Alcohol” 
      , 25 July 2007) in the past, such courses do not constitute the supervised relapse prevention treatment or therapy referred to in the evidence of the consultant psychiatrists. 
       
       
      (f) As there is presently no program or strategy in place directed at the defendant’s alcohol abuse disorder in order to prepare him for his release from custody, the CUBIT program is unlikely to  
      “facilitate the rehabilitation” 
       of the defendant as a serious sex offender that being one of the principal objects of the Act: s.3(b). 
       
       
      (g) It follows that any  
      “continuing detention” 
       of the defendant imposed under an order made under s.17 should only occur in circumstances in which both disorders referred to in (a) above are addressed by appropriately qualified personnel. Anything less than that carries with it the real prospect that the defendant will remain without the assistance the medical evidence indicates is essential for his rehabilitation. 
       
       
      (h) It is equally essential that the defendant is willing to participate in treatment programs to which I have referred and that he does so on a bona fide basis. 
       
       
      (i) Before the expiration of any period of continuing detention, it is necessary that the defendant be assessed in a timely manner by a consultant psychiatrist and others for the purpose of preparing a detailed management plan involving the supervision, support and other protective measures identified by Dr Samuels and set out in his report dated 30 May 2007, pp.18-19. Such a regime and its administration should be the subject of oversight by an appropriate person or agency. 
       
      
    170 There remains for consideration the determination of whether any order should be made as sought in the application and, if so, the type of order and its terms. 
     
      
       
      (a) On the evidence, no other conclusion can be reasonably reached other than that there is a moderate to high risk of the defendant committing a serious sex offence if released into custody. 
       
       
      (b) In terms of s.17(3) of the Act, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. In reaching that conclusion, I have regard, in particular, to the safety of the community (s.17(4)(a) of the Act) and to the evidence of both the examining psychologist, Ms Klamer, and the consultant psychiatrist (s.17(4)(b) of the Act). 
       
       
      (c) I am also satisfied to a high degree of probability that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. In so concluding, I have had regard, in particular, to the following:- 
       
       
        
        • the nature and circumstances of the defendant’s past sex offending conduct; 
        
       
       
      • the nature of his personality disorder; 
       
       
       • the risk of a relapse of his alcohol abuse disorder; 
       
       
        
        • the history of the defendant’s past breaches of parole (s.17(4)(f) of the Act); 
        
       
       
        
        • the defendant’s limited participation in the CUBIT program; 
        
       
       
        
        • the fact that, although he will require supervision and support upon his eventual release from custody, no plan has yet been developed to this end. 
        
       
      
    171 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that the application should be determined by the making of a continuing detention order under s.17 of the Act for a period of 12 months. 
     
      
    172 In the course of the hearing, I raised a question as to the Court’s power to impose conditions on a continuing detention order made under s.17 of the Act. In the “Plaintiff’s Supplementary Note” dated 1 August 2007, the plaintiff submitted that the Court does not have such a power. Mr Austin, in his reply submission, accepted that position. In the Plaintiff’s Supplementary Note (paragraph 18), it was accepted that nothing in the terms of the Act would prevent the Court from including, in its reasons for judgment when making a continuing detention order, recommendations regarding matters relating to the rehabilitation of the offender while in custody, including matters as to treatment, assessment and implementation having regard to the expert evidence that the Court has heard in the proceedings. The Crown Advocate, with respect, properly observed “the Court would expect that proper regard would be had to any such recommendations”. 
     
      
    173 In Attorney-General (Qld) v Francis [2005] QSC 381; (2005) 158 A Crim R 399, the first yearly review of a continuing detention order made pursuant to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 (Qld) (after the expiry of the respondent’s sentence) was before the court. At the time of making the original order, the court was told of a commitment by the Department of Corrective Services to implement a treatment plan which would involve some release of the respondent into the community. Under the relevant legislation, there was no provision for the court to place conditions on the continuing detention order. At the time of the first yearly review of the order, some aspects of the plan, including completion by the respondent of a substance abuse and managing relapse program, had been achieved. However, a number of other aspects of the treatment plan (including release) had not been carried out.  
     
      
    174 In light of the treatment plan not having been completely carried out, the Supreme Court of Queensland ordered that the respondent continue to be subject to the continuing detention order as it was determined that he remained a serious danger to the community and that the risk could not be managed by a supervision order.  
     
      
    175 Mackenzie J stated, at paragraphs 31-33:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The case of a person detained indefinitely for the protection of the community, especially one where there is evidence that treatment and gradual return to the community may provide some hope that the person may afterwards cease to be a serious danger to the community, is one where steps to achieve that end ought to be taken promptly. The objective of the legislation is that care and control by way of imprisonment should continue for only so long as there is acceptable cogent evidence to a high degree of probability that the person is a serious danger to the community because of unacceptable risk that he will commit a serious sexual offence if released from custody. ""Treatment"" is one of the three reasons for retaining the prisoner in custody after his sentence is completed. 
        
       
       
        
        Where there is, as in this case, medical evidence supporting the possibility of reintegration of the prisoner into society after treatment issues have been addressed, it is incumbent on his custodian to ensure that the suggested treatment occurs. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It cannot be lost sight of that the Act is concerned with preventative detention after the prisoner would otherwise have been released by effluxion of his finite sentence. Undue protraction of incarceration of the person because administrative procedures either do not exist to enable him to rehabilitate sufficiently to be released, or to prove that the actual risk in his case is not unacceptable, or because the administrative procedures unduly delay such rehabilitation or proof, is hard to convincingly justify. The Act is, after all, intended by its terms to allow continued detention only for as long as the unacceptable risk to the community clearly exists. It is not intended to lock up people and throw away the key if they may have prospects of rehabilitation to an extent where they can be released, given the opportunity, but are denied that opportunity due to administrative or procedural inadequacies.” 
        
       
      
    176 Mackenzie J also stated, at paragraphs 135-137:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The reason for raising the issues just discussed is not to make gratuitous criticism of the Department. It is to raise an important issue, that unless procedures exist for this special class of prisoner, the difficult question of drawing the boundary between making a continuing detention order which involves further imprisonment, or a supervision order, which does not, will have to be addressed more acutely than is necessary in this case. Of all kinds of prisoners, this category, if ready to be integrated back into the community by staged release, will need intensive supervision at least in the early stages to ensure that the conditions of release are strictly observed. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Lack of some kind of scheme under which prisoners of this category can be supervised intensively in the initial period of the stage of release is a serious deficiency. In particular, the lack of a facility in which the prisoner can reside where someone has authority to deal with and responsibility for dealing with observance of the terms of release seems to me to be a minimum requirement in the interests of the protection of the community. If that cuts across existing or proposed Departmental policy, the policy may have to be reconsidered in relation to this category of prisoner. If it requires significant commitment of resources, even though the Department may wish to deploy them in other ways, hard decisions will have to be made. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Department provides no means of effectively staging release of this category of prisoner back into the community, it may be that decisions about whether to further deprive a person of liberty, beyond the term of imprisonment imposed when the person is originally sentenced, will have to take that into account. It will have to be put into the balance, along with the fact that preventive detention is an extraordinary sanction, the consequences that flow from it by reason that it allows potentially open-ended deprivation of liberty and the inherent element of uncertainty in predicting further offending.” 
        
       
      
    177 Whilst the provisions of the Queensland Act considered in the above case are not identical to those in the Act the subject of the present proceedings (e.g. the differently worded test in s.17(3) of the Act and s.13(2) of the Queensland Act and the review provisions in s.30 of the latter Act) there is in my opinion sufficient similarity between them to render the above observations both relevant and significant in securing the shared objectives of both statutory schemes (s.3 in both Acts), namely, the protection of the community and the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. 
     
      
    178 I recommend that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Advice be obtained from a consultant psychiatrist as soon as practicable in relation to any assessment and treatment considered necessary for the defendant’s rehabilitation in light of the evidence in the present proceedings. 
       
       
      (b) That a supervised program be devised and implemented in accordance with any assessment and advice referred to in (a), such program to be reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist at such intervals as are practicable. 
       
       
      (c) That a management plan be developed in preparation for the defendant’s eventual release from custody including, in particular, a supervised program of monitoring and support with appropriate protective measures. In the development of such a plan, consideration should be given to the approach and arrangements that will be required for the implementation of the  
      “elements” 
       of extended supervision outlined by Dr Samuels in his report dated 30 May 2007, pp.18-19. 
       
       
      (d) That there be maintained, by a responsible office, during the 12 month period of continuing detention under the order set out below, a record of the development and implementation of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (c) above. 
       
      
    179 The above recommendations are made upon the basis that there will exist during the term of the continuing detention order the necessary willingness and participation of the defendant.

    180 Pursuant to s.17(1) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, Peter Andrew Quinn is to be detained in a correctional centre for one year from the date of this order (10 August 2007).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Maguire in the District Court of New South Wales on 23 January 2003 in respect of an offence under s.25(1) of the Drug (Misuse & Trafficking) Act 1985 of supply prohibited drug, to wit, ecstasy, committed by the applicant on 16 August 2002. 
     
      
    3 The offence was punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $200,000. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had adhered before his Honour on 23 January 2003 to the plea of guilty he had entered before a magistrate on 16 August 2002 pursuant to s.51A of the Justice Act 1902. 
     
      
    5 The applicant came forward at the time of sentence aged 56 years, having been born on 8 October 1946. He had been fined on 16 July 2002 at the Downing Centre Local Court $300 for possessing a prohibited drug and on 18 February 2003 had been fined $50 at the Central Local Court for using a vehicle which did not comply with the standard. 
     
      
    6 The learned trial judge imposed upon him a sentence of imprisonment for three years to date from the imposition of that sentence on 23 January 2003 with a non-parole period of two years to commence the same date. 
     
      
    7 The applicant had been on bail from the day following his arrest, but had been subject to stringent conditions requiring reporting three times per week and to continue to reside at his home premises. 
     
      
    8 His Honour referred to the statement of facts in his remarks on sentence. I take the following statement from his Honour’s reference to those matters:- 
     
      
       
        
        “At 1.20 am on Thursday 16 August 2002, police observed the defendant leaving the premises at 110 Cathedral Street, Woolloomooloo with two other male persons. The defendant, in the company of these two males, entered into vehicle KOS-00N, a black coloured Nissan Skyline sedan, which was parked and unattended upon the southern kerb of Cathedral Street approximately 10 metres east of the intersection of Riley Street, Woolloomooloo. 
        
       
       
        
        Upon reaching the intersection of William Lane, police stopped the defendant and subjected him to a roadside breath test, which proved negative. He then produced his New South Wales driver’s licence number 3493 LX and as a consequence, a routine check was made upon the defendant’s vehicle and his licence. Certain information was received from police radio. As a result, the defendant and his two male passengers were removed from the vehicle and searched. When the defendant’s person was searched, police located an amount of Australian currency in the left hand pocket of his cargo trousers. 
        
       
       
        
        This amount of cash totalled $4,050 (81 x $50). A further amount of Australian currency was located within the defendant’s wallet. This amount of cash totalled $790 (4 x $100, 5 x $50, 6 x $20, 1 x $10, 2 x $5). The defendant was then cautioned regarding the money. He informed police the cash was winning proceeds on poker machines at the Star City Casino. The police then searched the defendant’s vehicle. Located in the front off-side driver’s floor mat was four plastic resealable bags containing a total of 92 tablets of varying colours. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was cautioned in relation to the tablets to which the defendant then identified the tablets as being ecstasy. The tablets were then photographed in situ. The defendant was arrested and conveyed to the Kings Cross Police Station and placed into the holding cell. He was then given a s.10A which was explained to him. At 2.20 am the defendant was removed from the holding cell and witnesses the weighing of the tablets (27.80 grams). The drugs were placed in drug bag number B199196. The defendant was given the opportunity to complete a handwritten statement or participate in an electronic interview. 
        
       
       
        
        At 4.12 am the defendant was subjected to an electronic interview to which he made certain admissions. The defendant admitted using ecstasy for the past 12 months. The defendant advised the police he’d purchased ‘two thousand something’ dollars worth of ecstasy tablets from an Indonesian male known only as Abdul in the disco section of the Star City Casino. The defendant advised police the cost of each tablet was worth ‘$25 each’ for ‘around about 80 tablets’. 
        
       
       
        
        When questioned regarding the Australian currency, the defendant stated ‘I won $10,400 the night before’ (15/8/02), on the poker machines and then ‘some more at the casino tonight’ (16/8/02). When asked the purpose of his buying the ecstasy tablets, the defendant informed police ‘You don’t usually hear the music at the disco’ and to share with his friends in the Double Bay region. At 4.35 am the electronic interview was terminated and adopted by Sergeant Purvis.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour concluded that the applicant’s early plea of guilty should attract substantial consideration for its utilitarian value, but did not quantify that consideration. His Honour noted that the offender was caught with the drugs in his possession but made immediate admissions. He referred to a probation report tendered in evidence disclosing that the prisoner was then a single man aged 54 who had, except for the matters to which I have referred, a clear criminal history. He had been maintaining good relations with his ex-wife and his two daughters, but had become a persistent gambler, frequenting Star City Casino were he had, on occasions, gambled his entire weekly income. His Honour referred to the conclusion of the Probation and Parole Officer that the applicant was addicted to gambling, but noted that the appellant had been substantially employed over many years.10 On his arrest, the applicant had been found in possession of a considerable amount of money. Records produced from the Star City Casino in answer to subpoena confirmed that his account that he had obtained the money from winnings at the Casino was consistent with the Casino’s records. As to that, however, his Honour said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, these records do not disclose how much money was invested, and accordingly it is impossible to calculate whether the prisoner was a net winner. There is a truly remarkable coincidence between the frequency of those involved with drugs who also have in their possession large sums of money, the proceeds of successful gambling activities. I do not make any finding as to this aspect, I simply note that those who are involved with drugs seem to be lucky gamblers.” 
        
       
      
    11 At this portion of his remarks on sentence, his Honour does not relate his observations to the particular case of this applicant, although his Honour goes on later to say that he was sceptical of the prisoner’s account as given in the record of interview and would not automatically accept what he told the police was a reliable account. His Honour then adverted to the fact that the applicant did not give evidence and concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, I am entirely unconvinced as to the accuracy of all that he told the police.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour then referred to the applicant’s account that he had purchased the ecstasy tablets from funds supplied by friends who were to use the drug at a party and expressed the view that the applicant had been at pains to minimise his own drug use in what he told the police. His Honour said in this regard:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not prepared to accept that the prisoner simply purchased the ecstasy tablets for some $2,000 with a view to simply handing them over to friends at a party on a non-commercial basis.” 
        
       
      
    13 This, of course, was not a positive conclusion of any involvement in substantial commercial activity, nor does his Honour later come to such a conclusion. 
     
      
    14 His Honour then adverted to frequent statements of the Court of Criminal Appeal that custodial sentences are normally required whether or not a profit has been obtained for “trafficking alone in any substantial degree”. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentences involving substantial deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and only in exceptional circumstances would a non-custodial sentence be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        I hold no doubt that the prisoner obtained the drugs for the purposes of supply and for the purpose of reward, albeit there is no evidence by which I could accurately gauge the financial benefit to him. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour said of the applicant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not regard the prisoner as a Mr. Big in the drug supply scene, but nevertheless he was engaged in supplying some 92 tablets or thereabouts, involving some 27.5 grams, many times the trafficable quantity.” 
        
       
      
    16 He adverted to whether right thinking members of the community were justifiably frustrated and angered by a seeming impunity enjoyed by those who supply drugs and that when such persons were successfully prosecuted there should be a “meaningful price to pay”. He expressed the view that “some other would be Mr. Chong will be deterred when news of this sentence is published”. However, his Honour concluded that special circumstances lying in the prisoner’s age and his not having previously served a sentence existed warranting a variation of the non-parole to parole period ratio. Presumably by this, his Honour was referring to an extension to the parole period such as would arise by reason of the variation of the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. His Honour did impose a non-parole period of two years in respect of the sentence he imposed of three years expressed to be a significant, if not substantial, reduction below the normal statutory proportion. Regrettably, his Honour failed to make an order under s.50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 directing that the applicant be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    17 It will be necessary whatever otherwise might be the outcome of the appeal for such an order to be made. 
     
      
    18 One ground of appeal was articulated in support of the appeal. That ground was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in respect of the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    19 For my own part, I find such a ground difficult to understand. In Regina v. Simpson (2001) 126 A. Crim. R. 525, this court constituted by five judges examined the principles underlying the fixing of non-parole periods as they had existed under various sentencing regimes in New South Wales. Subsequently to Simpson (supra), the legislation with which Simpson (supra) was concerned has been amended. A new s.44 has been provided which requires the court to first set a non-parole period for the sentence and then refer to the balance of the term of the sentence. That provision applies to all offences committed on or after 1 February 2003. 
     
      
    20 Its predecessor applicable to the circumstances of this applicant’s offence required the court:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).” 
        
       
      
    21 By s.44(2) it is provided that the non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less. No provision was made by the statute to the extent to which the non-parole period may be less or for any particular proportion for the non-parole period to the entire sentence to be observed once special circumstances had been found. 
     
      
    22 The nature of the relationship between the non-parole period and the total term once special circumstances have been found, is governed by the general principles of sentencing law including those relating to the nature and purpose of parole: Regina v. GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376. It is important to note that an appropriate non-parole period in a given case whilst reflecting the considerations appropriate to the fixing of sentence generally: see Bugmy v. The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525, must be fixed having regard to the different purpose for the two parts of the sentence: Bugmy (supra) at 531 and be referrable to all the relevant considerations applicable in the particular case. 
     
      
    23 Thus, those matters which operate as factors in the synthesis may be reflected differently when weighed from the point of view of the fixing of a head sentence to when weighed from the point of view of fixing a non-parole period. But, as the review of the authorities to be found in the judgment of the Chief Justice in Simpson (supra) shows the non-parole period remains the minimum period of imprisonment which the offender must serve before being given the benefit of mitigation of punishment by the prospect of being released on conditional liberty: see Power v. The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 having regard to all the circumstances. 
     
      
    24 As that review of the authorities makes clear, rehabilitation still remains an important factor, particularly when coming to fix an appropriate non-parole period. 
     
      
    25 In my view the concern on this appeal is not as to some legal error in expressing the proportion of the non-parole period to the overall sentence arising from the fixing of the individual non-parole period, but whether or not the sentence or the non-parole period, having regard to all relevant considerations, are inappropriate to the crime of the offender and the offender’s circumstances such that appellate intervention under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is called for. 
     
      
    26 The particular circumstances of a case may mean a longer non-parole period and thus a shorter parole period or visa versa may need to be imposed. It may be that because of the statutory proportion, the fixing of a head sentence in the absence of special circumstances will mean that the non-parole period is defined by the statute. But once special circumstances are found, then it is for the trial judge consistent with the general principles and the exercise of a proper discretion to consider in the circumstances of the particular offender and the particular case what is, having regard to the importance of such matters as rehabilitation and objective seriousness, the minimum period of imprisonment an offender should serve for the particular crime and in compliance s.44, to do that (as that section stood at that time) in the context of having first focused on the length of the head sentence. 
     
      
    27 It can be seen that in an individual case all this may involve a delicate balance to ensure that the components of a proper sentence and non-parole period all rightly observe the relevant requirements, having regard to the important circumstances of the individual case. 
     
      
    28 It was contended in oral argument, that the trial judge had failed to consider whether other circumstances to those to which he had referred, that is, the prior clean record and age of the appellant, merited a reduction of the non-parole period. In particular, it was argued that his Honour had erred in appearing to consider the evidence concerning the applicant’s winnings as not sufficient to displace any suggestion of any substantial commercial benefit from this sale on his part. After all, the 92 tablets of ecstasy had not been sold. Apparently his Honour was seeking to consider that commercial activity of a substantial kind would be undertaken by the supply of the 92 tablets. 
     
      
    29 Reference was made to the statistics from the Judicial Commission which indicated that a non-parole period was at the top of the range for such offences as this on a plea of guilty and that this applicant was entitled to the full utilitarian discount for the plea and his prior good character.  
     
      
    30 It was submitted that the evidence showed the applicant did not appreciate the seriousness of his offence and particular regard was paid to the Probation and Parole Officer’s report which seemed to accept that the applicant was upset at being treated like a criminal and did not appear to acknowledge or understand the illegality of his actions. It was submitted that it was clear the applicant would find the experience of imprisonment more onerous than the average offender, although it appears to me that this is the matter to which his Honour was adverting when he referred to the combination of the applicant’s age and this being his first sentence. 
     
      
    31 It was put that the issues relating to drug use and gambling addiction plainly required in the community’s interest a longer than usual term to facilitate rehabilitation. 
     
      
    32 On behalf of the Crown, it was submitted his Honour adverted to those matters and that all the circumstances of the case required an appropriate minimum term of incarceration. It was submitted that the period fixed by his Honour, notwithstanding that it was at the top of the range and that this was plainly a case in which the circumstances might have mitigated towards a non-parole period somewhat less, nonetheless this non-parole period fell within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion such that no error of the kind referred to in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 existed. 
     
      
    33 I am unable to accept that submission. Once one accepts that it is not a matter of retaining some relationship by way of externally prescribed ratio based on considerations of how long each of the components of a valid sentence should be in relation to the other, once special circumstances are found and once one accepts that the appropriate course is to impose a non-parole period which is the minimum period the offender should spend incarcerated before having an opportunity (which might come at any time or not come at all until the end of the sentence) to be released on conditional supervised liberty, the focus of the enquiry in an appeal such as this will be on whether the non-parole period, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, fell within the range of the proper exercise of a discretion which was required to focus on the length of that minium period not the proportion the non-parole period bore to the head sentence. His Honour recognised this was a case for a reduced non-parole period. He did not advert to any considerations other than the offender’s first time in custody and age as warranting the reduction of the non-parole period from the statutory proportion to the two years non-parole period he imposed. He appears to have approached the task by seeking to vary the usually pre-determined ratio rather than by seeking to find that minimum period to which I have referred. 
     
      
    34 In my view, the non-parole period failed to have regard to all relevant factors mitigating that period and which it was appropriate be taken into account to determine what was an appropriate non-parole period. Such a period would, in my view, have provided for a longer parole period which would have met the need in this case for a longer period to be available for the offender’s rehabilitation and opportunity to be released. But that is incidental except insofar as the length of that period bears upon how long the non-parole period should be. 
     
      
    35 In my view, a non-parole period of 18 months would, taking all relevant matters into account, have been appropriate as the minimum period in all the circumstances the offender should serve. I therefore consider that the matters meeting the necessary criteria in s.6(3) have been made out. 
     
      
    36 For these reasons, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted; the appeal allowed; the sentence confirmed; the non-parole period imposed be quashed; and a non-parole period of 18 months be imposed to commence on 22 January 2003 and to expire on 21 July 2004 should be imposed and a direction should be given that the applicant be released to parole on the expiration of that non-parole period, but that it be recommended that he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and a requirement that he obey all reasonable directions of that Service including, in particular, directions concerning his gambling and drug use.

12452,2766540,R v Feuerstein [2015] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: The respondent, Michael Feuerstein, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment charging 25 counts of sexual offences committed against boys. He was found guilty of 21 of them. He also pleaded guilty to 2 charges on a separate indictment, referred to in this court as the second indictment. These were possessing and disseminating child abuse material. The sentence passed for the first of those charges, possessing child abuse material, took into an account an offence of possessing prohibited weapons on a Form 1.
	
	
	For the 2 offences on the second indictment he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 2 ½ years and 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 December 2011. For the 21 offences of which he was found guilty at trial he was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 14 years, comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 1 June 2012. The total sentence, then, was imprisonment for 14 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 9 ½ years.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against those sentences, asserting that they are manifestly inadequate and were affected by specific errors in the trial judge’s approach. I should record that there was a further matter on a s 166 certificate, for which the respondent was convicted without penalty, but that is not the subject of appeal.
	


Facts


	
	It is necessary to summarise the facts of this unusual case at some length. In relation to the offences of which the respondent was found guilty at trial, this is best done by reference to the trial judge’s findings expressed in his remarks on sentence, which include his assessment of the gravity of the offences.
	


The trial offences


	
	These offences were committed over a 20 year period, between 1991 and 2011. The offences were the following:
	



	
	counts of aggravated sexual assault: s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment;
	
	
	12 counts of aggravated indecent assault: s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment;
	
	
	2 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16: s 66C(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment;
	
	
	1 count of sexual intercourse without consent: s 61I of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.
	


Some of the later offences under s 61J and s 61M of the Act also carried standard non-parole periods: 10 years under s 61J and 5 years under s 61M.


	
	There were seven complainants, aged between 10 and 16 years at the relevant times. For the purpose of sentence, his Honour accepted tendency evidence admitted at the trial which established that:
	



	
	The respondent was sexually interested in young boys and motivated to act on that interest.
	
	
	There was a pattern of behaviour whereby he would befriend young boys, reward them “with such things as jobs, washing cars, small amounts of money, treats, playing with his guns, which he used as a security guard, dressing up and things of that nature, and providing them with pills and other drugs, including alcohol.”
	
	
	He would punish some of them by beating them with a cane or other items, and recorded details of this activity in notebooks.
	
	
	He photographed the boys in sexual poses where possible, and “indecently assaulted or sexually assaulted them if the opportunity arose.”
	



	
	As to the various counts, his Honour expressed his findings in his remarks as follows:
	


“Counts 1 and 2 [ss 61J and 61M] involved the complainant JC. All are said to have occurred at Rosemeadow in 1991. JC said that when he was about 12 or 13 he was a regular visitor to the offender’s home at Romeo Crescent, Rosemeadow. ... . JC, as a boy, would stay overnight. He would drink and take pills given to him by the offender. One night after drinking and taking a ‘red pill’ he woke in the offender’s bed to find the offender sucking his penis. He then passed out. JC said the next time he woke the offender had ejaculated on him and was rubbing the ejaculate into his chest with his hand. … .

JC spoke of another incident when after a massive drinking session or bender he woke to find himself naked in the offender’s bed. The offender was beside him also naked. He was rubbing JC’s chest and crotch. This touching was an assault. What was done, particularly to a young boy who was semi‑conscious, was indecent. JC was at the time aged 13, the offender 31. The offender exploited the complainant’s violent relationship with his own father. He exploited the child’s vulnerability by offering him work and a refuge and then taking advantage of him while he was a guest at Rosemeadow. There appear to be only two incidents during the many years that the offender had contact with JC.

I am prepared to accept that the offender also took an interest in other aspects of JC’s welfare; this was a common factor with many of the complainants. Whether that was genuine or simply to further his sexual desires I am unable to determine. I suspect that in his mind, both were present, despite their obvious incompatibility. The two offences involved the offender taking advantage of the fact that JC, a child, was drunk on liquor made available to him by the offender.

Count 3, an offence of sexual intercourse without consent knowing he was not consenting, involves GS. GS was then 16 or 17. He stayed at the offender’s Rosemeadow home. … . One night while watching TV on a lounge GS was given pills. He woke to find the offender sucking his penis. … . There was no consent because GS was asleep or knocked out by the pills. The offender was well aware of this as he had given him the pills. GS was 17, the offender 35. GS was a vulnerable young man with family problems who welcomed the opportunity of work and refuge at Rosemeadow.

Here the sexual act appears to be an isolated one in the context of a long relationship which continued after the event and well into GS’s adulthood. That relationship, as with others, had within it elements generically described as ‘grooming’ but part of that relationship also involved the complainant allowing the offender to take pleasure from the company of an attractive young man in exchange for gifts and other support.

                                                                                                             …

Such relationships can as here involve mutual interdependence. Something the offender, I believe, cultivated or instilled in the witness while he was young and vulnerable. The act itself, the subject of count 3, was a serious crime. GS was given pills; he was deliberately rendered helpless so the offender could sexually assault him.

Counts 4, 5 and 6 involve JD. Counts 4 and 5 involve s 66C(2) Crimes Act offences, sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and 16 [having the victim fellate him]. Count 6 is a s 61J(1) Crimes Act offence of sexual intercourse while a person was under authority.

In relation to Counts 4 and 5, I note the offender invited a troubled young man into his home. The offender became his foster carer for a short time but then asked JD to leave. After leaving the house JD returned and with friends broke in and stole a significant amount of property from Mr Feuerstein. The offender later ‘arrested’ JD and took him to police. JD was charged and convicted. On arrest he made a complaint the offender had forced on him anal intercourse. This complaint was unfortunately not followed up by the police; this was not JD’s fault.

The offender knew JD had a drug problem. He knew how old he was. He offered him money to suck his penis. The young man did this and was paid for what he did. … . JD was then under the accused’s authority. Count 5 relates to an almost identical allegation a few weeks later.

In relation to Count 6, as with Counts 4 and 5, money was offered to the complainant while he was living with the offender and after the offender had taken on the duties as his foster carer. This time the money was offered and accepted to engage in anal sex. After that intercourse commenced the complainant said ‘Stop. It’s hurting; I don’t want to do it.’ The offender said, ‘It’s all right. It will be all right’. He kept going despite continued protests until JD pulled away after about 30 seconds.

JD was a particularly vulnerable young man, aged 14, homeless, with a drug problem. The accused took him in and was paid to be his foster carer. He knew JD needed money for drugs. He exploited that need, JD’s obvious vulnerability, and his position of authority. Each offence involved a humiliating and degrading experience for the young boy. The intercourse, the subject of count 6, particularly so. While there was a form of consent, in the circumstances here the offender gains little in mitigation from it, given the objective facts and the method used by the offender to exploit the young man to gain his consent.

Counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 involve DH. Counts 7 and 8 are s 61M(1) Crimes Act offences. They involve incidents where the offender caned DH. DH’s evidence dealt with two specific incidences of caning which establish count 7 and 8. When DH was about eight years old in school Year 3 he was in the games room and was told to pull down his pants, bend over a stool and allow the offender to hit him on the bare buttocks using a cane. During the incident he was called a “sook” and his hair was pulled. Later, he said he was given $50 and dropped off home. He described another incident when he was in Year 5 when he was given a US $100 note after the offender hit him six times on the bare buttocks after he had got him to lean over a stool in the red room at Rosemeadow.

                                                                                                           …

Counts 9 and 10 involve s 61J(1) Crimes Act offences involving DH. On occasions when DH slept over at Rosemeadow he was given pills. He was told they were Valium. One time when he was in Year 5 he woke to a weird sensation and found the offender sucking his erect penis. He was told to relax and the offender kept going. This event started and continued without consent. As he was asleep when it started there could be no consent. A few weeks later DH was on the couch at Rosemeadow. Again, he woke to find the offender sucking his penis. This ‘freaked’ him out but the offender kept going, he said, for 15 minutes.

Count 11 involves an offence of indecency from 2001, s 61M(1) Crimes Act. One night at Rosemeadow the offender masturbated DH’s penis over his clothes, there was no skin on skin contact. DH was then in Year 6. This occurred on the couch in the red room.

DH was the youngest of the complainants. He was caned from when he was nine years old and while the offence period covers three years his association with the offender continued until he was a young adult. His association with the offender followed the now familiar pattern. He was young, with a difficult home life. He was drawn to the offender by the apparent security of the home at Rosemeadow and also the jobs, gifts and money that were provided to him. Again, in relation to count 10 he was given a pill and woke to find the offender sucking his penis. Later incidents did not appear to involve pills.

Again, each offence resulted in serious interference with the physical integrity of the child. While I am prepared to accept the canings were not as harsh as described in the notebooks they still involved the infliction of pain. They were part of a grooming process and had the capacity to cause DH significant long term emotional and psychological harm. Again, the child was groomed to play a part in the offender’s ongoing fantasy and sexual interest in young boys. That interest went well beyond fantasy. He recruited DH into acting out those fantasies, taking advantage of and exploiting his youth and naivety.

The next matter is count 16. It involves EC. It is a s 61M Crimes Act matter said to have occurred in 2001. EC was another young man who would hang around the office of the accused’s security business. On one occasion he was taken to a separate office and told to ‘drop his trousers’. He was caned on the bare buttocks by the offender who then touched the spot that had been caned. … . EC said he used to hang around the office but did not return after this. This matter appears to be, so far as this one complainant is concerned, an isolated incident.

Counts 17 through to 23 involve JK. They are all matters charged pursuant to s 61M(1) Crimes Act. They all occurred in 2007. JK lived in a house that was built in front of the offender’s home at Rosemeadow. … . Counts 17 to 23 all involve allegations of assault and an act of indecency on JK when JK was under the age of 16.

Count 17 involves a bet JK had with the offender about a firecracker. He lost the bet and so was hit on the buttocks. He was not sure in evidence if they were bare or not, when he was hit with a cane or a strap but he said he was hit five to eight times. … .

Count 18 involves an offence that occurred in the study room. The offender was sitting on the computer chair and he pulled JK over his lap, pulled his pants down and hit him multiple times on the bare buttocks with a wooden flute until it broke. JK said that he ended up with a lot of purple bruising. … .

Count 19 involves an offence where JK was caned or strapped on the bare buttocks when he bent over a pool table after he lost a game of pool. He was in Year 7. … .

Count 20 involves caning of JK because he was ‘sooking’ about bruises from an earlier caning. … .

Count 21 involves an incident where JK was handcuffed and bent over a black chair and caned.

Count 22 follows another bet between JK and the offender in which JK first caned the offender. He lost the bet and the offender then ‘Made me pull my pants down and caned me on the bare backside.’

Count 23 occurred before a trip that JK and the offender took to the town of Harden. He was caned, apparently to prevent him misbehaving on the trip. JK could not remember the exact circumstances of the caning.

Each allegation occurred while JK was under 16. Each relates to a separate and specific act of caning, each involved an assault; each involved an act of indecency because of the circumstances, particularly those involving the caning on the buttocks of the child. More so, where those buttocks were bare. … .

The offender actively sought out JK, the son of his next door neighbours. JK was not as vulnerable as the other complainants but the offender successfully exploited his youth and immaturity. He offered him jobs, holidays and gifts. He gradually introduced JK into his own fantasy world and induced him to act some of those sexual fantasies out. JK was intelligent and mature enough to end his association with the offender prior to there being any further escalation of indecent activity. These crimes, however, involved a significant abuse of a young child and while the offender may pretend to himself that JK was his friend, the relationship was exploitative and wrong.

When I examine each of these matters individually I do form the view that they fall, however, well below the middle of the range of objective circumstances. Individually, they are not mid-range offences. When I come to impose a sentence I must impose individual sentences for each matter but the collective impact of this series of offences cannot be underestimated.

Counts 24 and 25 involve matters involving sexual intercourse between the offender with JC, while JC was under the authority of the offender. They are the most recent allegations.

The offender had been employed as a security officer for many years. It then appears he was for a period unemployed. He sought and obtained a job as a youth caseworker with a reputable youth support agency. The offender abused that position by first, bribing JC and then because of those bribes and pressure, that is by abuse of his position and authority, made JC suck the offender’s penis while in the lounge of the agency’s home at Canyonleigh: count 24. While the child obeyed the direction and did not protest there was no consent; that is, conscious and voluntary agreement. The offender knew this was the case as demonstrated by his own words and actions towards JC, as JC described them to the jury.

It is not in dispute JC was a child under 16, so each element of the charge was well established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence. So far as Count 25 is concerned JC’s account must be accepted. One night he woke to find the offender had placed his penis inside his anus. He did so for only a short period as JC soon, and understandably, objected. As JC was asleep he could not consent, and as the offender was staying at the home overnight as part of his job of caring for the child it is beyond reasonable doubt that JC was under his authority. Given the description of how JC was lying on the bed the event must have happened in the room he moved to after a fire at Canyonleigh, that is, after 17 August 2011.

The events of 2011 indicate the offender’s criminal behaviour had escalated to another level. I can only find that he had one motive for taking the position with the youth support agency and that was the access it gave him to young boys. He got the job because he presented as a person of good character with a genuine interest in the welfare of young people. Both were lies.

JC was in his care and under his authority. The offender owed a special responsibility to JC by virtue of his position. He had read JC’s extensive file. He knew his vulnerabilities and I suspect believed that JC was unlikely to complain and that if he complained, unlikely to be believed. The offender used his position to compel the intercourse of count 24 and sexually penetrated the sleeping child under his care, count 25. While this was a relatively brief episode it was a gross violation of the child’s physical integrity.”

The complainant JC in counts 1 and 2 is not the same person as the complainant JC in counts 24 and 25.


	
	As to these offences generally, his Honour said:
	


“It is well recognised that sexual crimes can lead to psychological upset, confusion and difficulties later in life. Here each child was in their own way vulnerable. All looked up to the offender. He preyed on their vulnerabilities, which were known to him. He, I find, presumed that confusion, shame and embarrassment would inhibit complaint and that because of his position and their vulnerabilities they would not complain. He was right.

Sexual abuse of children was and remains of grave concern to the community and the courts. Children should grow up free of such crimes. Serious and repeated sexual interference with children calls for substantial punishment, particularly where, as here, trust and in some cases a position of authority was abused. Had some of the indecent assault matters occurred in isolation a gaol sentence might have been avoided but these offences did not occur in isolation. They were part of a pattern of offending involving exploitation of multiple child victims over two decades.

While the offender will only be punished for the crimes specifically before the Court for sentence his behaviour in securing the compliance of his victims deserves condemnation. There is, for offences which involve such a manipulation of children, a community expectation that they merit severe punishment. That said, however, a proper purpose for the criminal law is not to give effect to the irrational prejudices of ill informed public opinion, see Justice McHugh in Ryan v R (2001) 206 CLR 267 cited in Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [40] ((sic) [42]).”


	
	Later, his Honour said:
	


“Each complainant in evidence exhibited obvious distress, not only in regard to what was done to them at the time but also at having to return to what was for them clearly a distasteful and disturbing event Their disgust at the accused’s denials of committing offences toward them was palpable as they gave their evidence.

While the offender is not to be punished for exercising his right to trial the continuing impact of his offending behaviour of each of his victims should never be underestimated. A Court in sentencing any offender must recognise the harm that their offending caused.”

The second indictment


	
	As I have said, the second indictment charged two offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty: possessing child abuse material and disseminating child abuse material, each an offence under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	There was an agreed statement of facts, which can be summarised relatively briefly. On 1 December 2011, police executed a search warrant at the respondent’s home, then at Glen Alpine. A large variety of child abuse material was found. On computers a large number of photos and videos amounting to child pornography were found. As to the photos, there were over 7,000 images containing child pornography or child abuse material. A large number of them depicted young boys, both clothed and naked, being caned. There were 280 videos containing child abuse material. The photos and videos embraced material of a gravity within each of the five categories of the Child Exploitation Tracking Scheme (CETS).
	
	
	Police also found a little over 2,500 printed photographs depicting young boys, naked or in various stages of undress. Some showed the boys being caned or spanked. Some of these photos had been downloaded from the internet, but others had been taken by the respondent, including photos of victims of the trial offences.
	
	
	Police also found 13 written “stories”, describing in explicit detail the sexual pleasure to be derived from caning young boys, particularly on the naked buttocks. Some went on to describe sexual experiences subsequent to the caning, ranging from homosexual experiences between boys to anal intercourse between adults and boys, as well as boys being tied and caned and subjected to sexual abuse. Most of these stories were within category five on the CETS scale, as they depicted sexual sadism. Others were categorised as two to three on the scale.
	
	
	Also found were two books described as “punishment books”, detailing chastisement of boys with a cane, strap or paddle for various “offences”, such as disobedience, stealing, talking in class, and smoking. In addition, three personal diaries were found providing additional detail about the incidents in the punishment books, and describing the respondent caning particular boys, fondling their genitalia, being himself caned by boys, and generally fantasising about the boys in the punishment books. As I understand it, this material included the notebooks recording the caning of boys referred to in relation to the trial offences. Finally, police located a “consent form” purporting to be available for signature by boys prepared to agree to a variety of corporal punishments set out in the document.
	
	
	All this material, apparently accumulated over many years, constituted the child abuse material the subject of the first count. As to the second count, disseminating child pornography, police located email communications between the respondent and a man in America in the later part of 2006. There were multiple emails, including photos, of a sexual nature, demonstrating a homosexual interest in boys in their early teens, including caning. In these communications the respondent pretended to be a teenage boy.
	
	
	The offence on the Form 1, taken into account on sentence for the first count, was possession of prohibited weapons without a permit: s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act. During the search of the respondent’s home police also found six handcuffs and an extendable baton. He had no licence or authority to possess those items.
	
	
	In the light of the material found at his home, his Honour was satisfied that the respondent derived sexual pleasure from the corporal punishment inflicted on the victims of the relevant trial offences. The respondent conceded in evidence at the trial that he fantasised about the administration of corporal punishment, to which, he acknowledged, there might be a sexual element. His Honour accepted that some of the written material relating to corporal punishment was the product of fantasy – in particular, the stories to which I have referred – but was satisfied that other material recorded real events. He acknowledged the policy of criminalising acts of fantasy of this kind, referring to the judgment of Howie J in Jarrold v R [2010] NSWCCA 69, but added:
	


“I do not regard fantasy communications or fantasy documents as being as serious as those involving actual children but even fantasies produce a distorted view of reality in which sex with children is somehow seen as appropriate.

Here my main focus must be on the number and type of images of real children possessed by the offender, and the number and nature disseminated by him.”


	
	His Honour had regard to the matters relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences of possessing or disseminating child pornography considered by R A Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140, 201 A Crim R 243, at [81]-[95] (257-261). He emphasised the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for crimes of this kind, noting that prior good character is entitled only to limited weight as a mitigating factor. He discounted the sentence for each count by 15% in recognition of late pleas of guilty.
	


Subjective case


	
	Born on 20 September 1962, the respondent was aged between 28 and 49 over the period of his offending (from June 1991 to December 2011). He is now 52. He has a minor criminal history, relating to his failure to maintain a firearms register (presumably arising from his involvement in the security industry). His Honour treated him as a person of prior good character. He added, however, that that factor was not entitled to significant weight, given the pattern of repeat offending over a period of time during which he “used his position in the community to further his own sexual gratification.”
	
	
	As I have said, the respondent’s employment at relevant times was as a security officer. He had formerly been an officer of the Australian Federal Police. Because of that background, and the nature of his offences, he had been on protection in conditions of “non-association” and “limited association.” His Honour noted that they are harsher regimes for any prisoner, and found that he would probably spend the bulk of his sentence in some form of protection. His Honour also accepted that a fear of physical attack upon him because of his status as an ex-police officer and a child sex offender would continue “to prey upon him.”
	
	
	His Honour also took into account evidence that the respondent has a number of medical problems, which were likely to increase during his time in custody.
	


Other sentencing issues


	
	His Honour considered the related issues of accumulation, concurrence and totality, with reference to relevant authority. He recognised the need for at least partial accumulation in a case where an offender stands for sentence for “separate and discrete criminal acts.” He added:
	


“Courts must always be cautious in accumulating sentences because of the compounding impact of long sentences. Each year in gaol has a greater impact on any person than the year preceding it. Sentences should not crush any hope or desire for rehabilitation that a prisoner might belatedly feel … .

The impression, however, should never be given that there is some kind of discount for multiple offending … . A court must maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed.”


	
	His Honour related that last sentence to a case, such as the present, involving multiple offences against different victims. Turning to the issue of the non-parole period, he said:
	


“The aggregate non-parole period here must reflect the minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the crimes call for such a detention … . All the purposes of sentencing relate both to the parole and non-parole portions of a sentence but these purposes are given different weight because the parts of a sentence themselves serve different purposes … .”


	
	His Honour had regard to the age of the offences, and the changes in the sentencing regime over the long period during which they were committed. The first seven offences, committed between 1991 and 1999, were subject to the Sentencing Act 1989. The remaining offences were governed by the current legislation, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which came into force in April 2000. (The eighth offence, committed between January 2000 and December 2001 spans those periods.) That said, with the exception of counts 4 and 5, under s 66C(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, which has since been replaced, the maximum sentences have not changed. The remaining offences (counts 9 to 25), committed between 2001 and 2011, are either aggravated sexual assault under s 61J(1) or aggravated indecent assault under s 61M(1). Of those the last nine, committed between 2007 and 2011, attract a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In the District Court the respondent was represented by Mr Scragg of counsel, who also appeared in this court. His Honour noted Mr Scragg’s submission that a number of the trial offences were “historical”, requiring the imposition of a lesser sentence than might be expected now. Reference was made to the judgment of Button J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50, a case involving sentences for historical sexual offences, albeit very much older than those in the present case. Button J dealt with this issue at [82] ff. In this court Mr Scragg focused upon the following passage at [127]-[129]:
	


“[127]   The fifth factor is judicial memory. Bell JA referred to it in Featherstone v R, when her Honour said at [45]:

‘[T]his review of a small sample of cases involving broadly similar sexual offences does support the applicant's submission that there has been a significant upward trend in the length of sentences for offences of this character in recent years. It is an impression that accords with my recollection of the pattern of sentencing for sexual offences before the introduction of the Sentencing Act.’

[128]   RS Hulme J referred to it in PWB v R, when His Honour said at [68]:

‘Although as I have said, the Applicant was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards applicable at the time of his offending, in the case of the second offence, 1991, it is not easy to determine what those standards were. I have no difficulty in accepting that they were more lenient than at present. This has been recognised in Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71 at [45]; McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48 at [62]; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147 at [176] and accords with my own recollection of events. However, such recognition provides no indication of what the standards were.’

[129]   My impression is identical to that of Bell JA and RS Hulme J: sentences have indeed increased for serious sexual      offences over the past quarter century, in some cases markedly. The concession made in this Court by the Crown Prosecutor, who happens to be a most experienced practitioner in the area of criminal law, lends support to my recollection.”


	
	His Honour accepted Button J’s analysis, while adding that it did not convey that categorisation of an offence as “historical” necessarily meant that a lesser sentence was required. However, relevantly for the present case, he perceived a general increase in sentences in respect of offences for which a non-parole period had been prescribed, citing a passage from a Judicial Commission publication in 2010, Impact of Standard Non-Parole Periods, Research Monograph 33:
	


“Generally the impact of these provisions on sentencing has been to increase both terms of sentence and non-parole periods for standard non-period offence.”


	
	His Honour found special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the ratio between sentence and non-parole period, although acknowledging that it should only be “relatively modest.” Special circumstances were found because of the measure of accumulation of sentence which he proposed, together with the need to help the respondent adjust to normal community life after a lengthy period in custody. His Honour noted that he would need sex offender programs while in custody and, upon his release, would “also need to be closely supervised and, in my opinion, the longer the better.”
	


The appeal


	
	The principal ground of the appeal is that the total sentence, including the effective non-parole period, is manifestly inadequate. The other grounds are for the most part particulars of that ground. In summary, they assert the following:
	



	
	The aggregate sentence for the trial offences is manifestly inadequate, having regard to the totality of criminality involved, and the non-parole period is inadequate to reflect the criminality of those offences.
	
	
	Each of the sentences for the offences on the second indictment is inadequate, noting that the sentence for the first count had to reflect the offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	The 15% discount for the pleas of guilty to the offences on the second indictment is excessive, given the timing of those pleas.
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding special circumstances, so as to ameliorate the total effective non-parole period.
	
	
	The degree of accumulation of the aggregate sentence upon the sentences for the offences on the second indictment is inadequate, failing to reflect the totality of the criminality of all the offences.
	


The aggregate sentence


	
	As to the aggregate sentence, the Crown prosecutor in this court submitted that the indicated sentences for the various offences conveyed that his Honour had not given appropriate consideration to the maximum penalty and, where applicable, the prescribed standard non-parole period for each of them. He acknowledged that the indicative sentences were not themselves appellable, but relied upon authority that a sentencing judge must assess the criminality of the individual offences and that an erroneous approach demonstrated in an indicated sentence may reveal error in the aggregate sentence: R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, per Grove AJ (with whom Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreed) at [17].
	
	
	I do not understand the Crown prosecutor to have argued that his Honour failed to have regard to the maximum sentences or applicable standard non-parole periods. His Honour said in his remarks, “Careful attention to maximum penalties and where applicable, standard non-parole periods, is always required.” He went on to develop that proposition, referring to Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2006) 228 CLR 357. Rather, the Crown prosecutor’s argument was that his Honour appears to have given inadequate weight to those factors in arriving at the indicative sentence for each offence.
	
	
	That argument was not developed by reference to the indicative sentences individually. They are to be found in the table set out at [10] above. They range from 6 months (for several of the offences of indecent assault by caning the victims) to 8 years for anal intercourse with the last of the victims. Non-parole periods are also indicated for the offences carrying a standard non-parole period, ranging from 9 months (for a caning offence) to 6 years (for the anal intercourse). In my view, an examination of the indicative sentences in the table demonstrates careful attention to the gravity of each crime, having regard to the widely varying circumstances of them. None of them appear to me to demonstrate an erroneous assessment of their criminality.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this court provided Judicial Commission statistics of full time custodial sentences imposed for the trial offences. He did so acknowledging the caution which this court has consistently urged in the use of that material, reiterated recently by Bellew J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreed) in MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183, particularly at [44]-[46]. The statistics relate to the offences under the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act: s 61J(1) and s 61M(1) (both before and after the introduction of the relevant standard non-parole periods), s 61I and s 66C(2). The Crown prosecutor relied upon these figures in respect of all the offences, even though they cover the period from 2007 to 2014, embracing only counts 16-25.
	
	
	There are statistics for head sentences and non-parole periods in respect of all offenders. However, for the offences which do not carry a standard non-parole period only the head sentences are relevant. I do not propose to summarise these figures. As one would expect, they show a wide range of sentences for each of the relevant offences and, in relation to the offences carrying a standard non-parole period, an equally wide range of non-parole periods. There is also a considerable variety in the number of cases upon which they are based.
	
	
	These figures provide no useful guidance in assessing his Honour’s indicative sentences. I might add that, with three exceptions, all those sentences fall within the ranges disclosed by the statistics. The three exceptions are counts 20, 21 and 23, indecent assaults by caning the complainant. For each of those the indicative sentence was 6 months. However, there is force in Mr Scragg’s submission that those offences in isolation would not necessarily have warranted a full time custodial sentence.
	
	
	The question remains whether the aggregate sentence, including the non-parole period, adequately reflects the overall criminality of the trial offences. To this I shall return.
	


The child pornography offences


	
	Turning to the child pornography offences, it will be recalled that for the possession offence, taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 ½ years, and for the dissemination offence a fixed term of 1 year and 3 months. In this court the Crown prosecutor treated both terms as equivalent to the non-parole periods of sentences which might otherwise have been imposed. Noting the 15% discount for the pleas of guilty, he pointed out that the undiscounted figures would have been 3 years and 1 year and 6 months respectively. Given the level of criminality of both offences and the maximum sentence for each of them of 10 years imprisonment, and noting that the sentence for the first count embraced the criminality of the offence of possessing prohibited weapons, he argued that each sentence is manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor took issue with his Honour’s observation (quoted at [18] above) that he did not regard fantasy communications or documents as seriously as those involving actual children, citing Jarrold v R (supra). That case involved charges, among others, of producing child pornography arising from internet communications between the offender and other men in which he described sexual activity between himself and children. The sentencing judge had found that this material was the product of fantasy rather than real events (although he recognised the gravity of the dissemination of perverted material of that kind). It was in this context that Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) made the observation at [53]:
	


“Whether or not the material discussed in the communications was the result of fantasies or accounts of actual events was irrelevant. If there was evidence to prove these events actually happened, other charges might have been brought against the respondent. If his Honour’s finding was made in order to diminish the seriousness of the offences, then he was in error.”


	
	Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124 was an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case in respect of child pornography offences. Some of the material comprised text messages sent by the applicant to another man describing his fantasies of engaging in sexual acts with boys. As in the present case, the sentencing judge had expressed the view that those communications were not as serious as they would have been if they described real events, although they remained serious because they produced a distorted view of reality in which sex with children was seen as appropriate. In the Court of Criminal Appeal the leading judgment was given by Beech-Jones J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed). In relation to this issue Beech-Jones J said at [54]-[55]:
	


“[54]   However, the applicant also contended that the ‘fantasy’ nature of the material meant that its production and dissemination was less serious than the material depicting sexual activity involving actual children, and the fact that it was it was only a communication between two persons via SMS meant that ‘other people’ would not be likely to view it.

[55]   In relation to the former contention it was one that his Honour accepted in this case although his Honour noted that a different approach was adopted by Howie J in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [53]. I see no error in his Honour's characterisation of the material in this case. However each case depends on its facts. There are undoubtedly situations in which the production and dissemination of material that does not involve the depiction of real children can still constitute an extremely serious breach of s 91H(2).”


	
	Both those cases were concerned with the dissemination of child pornography and, plainly enough, communication to others of material of this kind is a serious matter even if it is the product of fantasy. In the present case it appears to me that his Honour’s observation about fantasy was directed primarily, if not entirely, to some of the material the subject of the possession charge. While his Honour’s observation about fantasy was expressed to relate to “communications or fantasy documents”, it was made early in the remarks on sentence before he turned to the facts of the child pornography offences and it has the character of a statement of general principle. Later, when considering the facts of the offences, he said of the respondent:
	


“I accept he did fantasise about caning and he did invent the stories in the ‘punishment books.’ Given the diaries included ordinary events, however, I do not accept his assertion that those parts relating to caning and which could be regarded as admissions were in fact fantasy. They, like the captions on the photographs in the punishment books, may have been in part fantasy but they also held a kernel of truth.”


	
	That said, the emails the subject of the dissemination charge did describe homosexual activity with teenage boys which included caning. Whether his Honour’s finding about a measure of fantasy extended to those communications is unclear. However, even if they did, the statement of Howie J in Jarrold should not be understood as one of universal application. I respectfully agree with the flexible, case by case, approach expressed by Beech-Jones J in Martin.
	
	
	In relation to these offences also, the Crown prosecutor sought to support his submission that they are inadequate by reference to Judicial Commission statistics in relation to offences under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. These again focus on cases in which full time custodial sentences were passed, but here after a plea of guilty. They cover the period from January 2009 to March 2014. Head sentences range from 6 months to 6 years (a sample of 46 cases), and non-parole periods from 6 months to 2 years (a sample of 19 cases). Here also, the figures do not assist in evaluating the sentences passed in the present case. Certainly, given that those fixed terms should be viewed as equivalent to non-parole periods, the figures do not demonstrate that either of them is manifestly inadequate.
	


The pleas of guilty


	
	In relation to the child pornography offences, the Crown prosecutor also submitted that the discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty is excessive. Those pleas were not entered until the day fixed for trial. Reference was made to the familiar passage from the judgment of Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, 195 A Crim R 1, at [31] (9):
	


“As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case. The amount of the discount cannot depend upon the practice of the particular court based upon its administrative arrangements. It is difficult to see how, in the usual case, a plea of guilty on arraignment could justify a discount of more than about 15 per cent. There was nothing in the present case that justified a discount above that range.”


	
	His Honour found the pleas to have had “some utilitarian value.” It seems that the fact that they were entered so late arose from their inclusion in the same indictment as the trial counts but, in my view, nothing turns on this. The fact remains that what Howie J had to say in Borkowski was no more than a guide to the exercise of an undoubted discretion and is not prescriptive. There is no basis on which it could be said that the discount applied by his Honour was beyond the bounds of the legitimate exercise of his discretion.
	
	
	In this court the Crown prosecutor submitted that the discount should have been no more than 10%, without conceding that it should have been that high. The practical effect of this dispute is a difference of no more than a matter of months. This ground of appeal is without substance.
	


Special circumstances


	
	In relation to the aggregate sentence for the trial offences, the Crown prosecutor challenged his Honour’s finding of special circumstances and the extent of the reduction of the non-parole period from the statutory proportion of that account. He acknowledged that the accumulation of the aggregate sentence on the sentences for the child pornography offences justified some reduction, but only such as would maintain a proportion of 75% between the effective non-parole period and the total sentence. That reduction would be modest because the accumulation was only by 6 months. In fact, the total sentence of 14 ½ years and the effective non-parole period of 9 ½ years left a period of parole eligibility of 5 years.
	
	
	The application of the 75% ratio to the total sentence would have produced an effective non-parole period of about 10 years and 11 months, leaving a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months. The Crown prosecutor noted that, apart from accumulation, his Honour found special circumstances in the respondent’s need to adjust to community life after a lengthy period in custody and to be closely supervised for “the longer the better.” He referred to cl 218(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulations 2014, which limits the period during which a parole order may require an offender to be subject to supervision to 3 years. Thus, he argued, the application of the statutory proportion would provide a period of eligibility more than sufficient to meet the purpose of supervision.
	
	
	However, as Mr Scragg pointed out, the respondent’s parole would not come to an end when supervision was terminated. For the remainder of the balance of his term he would still be subject to the sanction of parole, whereby his rehabilitation and the protection of the community would continue to be fostered. There is ample authority for the proposition that a finding of special circumstances, and the measure by which it is reflected in the length of the non-parole period, are matters of discretionary judgment although, of course, guided by principle: see, for example, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, 53 NSWLR 704.
	
	
	That said, in Simpson Spigelman CJ reminded us at [63] (718) that “there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.” The Crown’s primary complaint in the present case is that the effective non-parole period does not achieve that end.
	


Accumulation/Manifest Inadequacy? 


	
	It is the issue of accumulation that gives rise to the Crown’s primary complaint about the total sentence. The asserted inadequacy of that sentence is said to arise from the lack of an appropriate measure of accumulation. The Crown prosecutor argued that the 14 year aggregate sentence for the trial offences is the result of inadequate accumulation of the indicative sentences. He noted that the sentences for the child pornography offences were directed to be served concurrently, and that they were accumulated upon the aggregate sentence for the trial offences only by 6 months. He submitted that there should have been partial accumulation of the sentences for the child pornography offences and a greater measure of accumulation of those sentences upon the aggregate sentence. The result, he argued, is an overall sentence inadequate to mark the totality of the respondent’s criminality.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor referred us to two decisions of this court dealing with sentence for offending of this kind, again acknowledging the line of authority, also referred to by Bellew J in MLP at [40] ff, that reference to other cases can only be of limited assistance. These were R v Woods [2009] NSWCCA 55, 195 A Crim R 173 and, more importantly, R v Gommeson [2014] NSWCCA 159, both of them Crown appeals. In both cases the respondent had pleaded guilty. The Crown prosecutor did not take us to the facts and circumstances, or the reasoning of the court, in either of those cases, but relied upon them generally as some indication of an appropriate range of sentence.
	
	
	In Woods the respondent had committed a large number of sexual offences, of varying degrees of gravity, upon three boys during two discrete periods in 2005 and 2007. He had also shown the boys pornographic films. A Crown appeal succeeded and sentences totalling 9 ½ years with an effective non-parole period of 6 ½ years were passed, but after a discount of 40% for the respondent’s early pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities in the investigation of the matter.
	
	
	In Gommeson the respondent was dealt with for 19 sexual offences committed against seven boys, aged between 9 and 16, over a period between early 2005 and late 2011. There were 11 further offences of that kind on a Form 1. In relation to some of the boys the charges were representative counts, being part of a continuing pattern of abuse. He also showed the boys pornographic videos. He was also dealt with for a charge of possessing child abuse material, being photographs he had taken of his victims. In the District Court he had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 8 ½ years. Re-sentence after a successful Crown appeal led to an overall sentence of 17 years with an effective non-parole period of 12 years.
	
	
	The error found by the Court of Criminal Appeal was an inadequate measure of accumulation of the individual sentences. Johnson J, with whom Harrison and Garling JJ agreed, reviewed authority on the issue of accumulation at [106] ff. In particular, at [114] his Honour referred to the need in cases involving several victims to ensure a proper level of accumulation “to guard against a view that, in reality, there is virtually no penalty at all imposed for sexual offences committed against one or more victims”: citing his own judgment in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302.
	
	
	Neither Woods nor Gommeson involved the use of the aggregate sentence procedure under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the present case it was used. As I have said, the indicative sentences ranged from 6 months to 8 years. Plainly enough, there was a significant measure of accumulation to arrive at the aggregate term of 14 years. It should also be noted that Gommeson did not involve “historic child sex offences being dealt with long after the commission of the offences”: Johnson J at [88]. In the present case a number of the earlier offences did fall into that category and, as I have said, his Honour took that matter into account.
	
	
	Woods and Gommeson turned on their own facts, as does the present case. I have referred to his Honour’s remarks on sentence comprehensively, including quoting significant passages from it, to demonstrate the thoroughness with which he approached the matter. The remarks betray a careful assessment of the objective features of the case, and an equally careful examination of the sentencing issues which arose with reference to relevant principles. This included the issue of accumulation in which, of course, the question of totality loomed large. This was a difficult sentencing task, involving a determination of the appropriate punishment for offences extending over a lengthy period, affected by different sentencing regimes and patterns of sentence.
	
	
	All this the Crown prosecutor fairly acknowledged. Nevertheless, he maintained his submission that the total sentence and the effective non-parole period are inadequate. I am not so persuaded. Since preparing these reasons I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Schmidt J, and I acknowledge the force of her Honour’s observations about the gravity of these offences. Nevertheless, the sentencing outcome is a substantial overall sentence and effective non-parole period. It may fairly be seen as lenient, but I remain of the view that it does not call for this court’s intervention on a Crown appeal. Schmidt J has referred to the recent decision of the High Court in CMB v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] HCA 9. The well established principles governing Crown appeals were restated in that case by French CJ and Gageler J at [35], and need not be repeated here.
	
	
	I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	PRICE J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the draft judgments of Hidden J and Schmidt J. I agree with Hidden J that the overall sentence and effective non-parole period may be regarded as lenient, but as his Honour points out that does not call for this Court’s intervention on appeal. After profound deliberation, I am not persuaded by the Crown that there is an appealable error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Accordingly, I find myself in disagreement with Schmidt J’s conclusion of manifest inadequacy of the aggregate sentence for the trial offences, the sentence for the child abuse material offences and the overall sentence.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In this case I find myself in disagreement with Hidden J, who has come to the conclusion that there was no error in his Honour’s assessment of the criminality involved in any of Mr Feuerstein’s individual offences, in the aggregate sentence imposed for the trial offences, or in the overall sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was sentenced for 23 separate sexual offences against young boys, having been charged with 25 counts, of which he was found guilty at trial of 21 and having entered a late plea to 2 others: one count of possessing child abuse material and another of disseminating such material. The earliest of his offences was committed in 1991. They came to light after execution of a search warrant at his home in December 2011, after the latest and most serious of his sexual abuse offences, involving anal intercourse while his victim was asleep.
	
	
	In CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9, Heydon JA’s observations in R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at [12], in relation to Crown appeals were referred to with approval at [33] - [34]:
	


""if [the Court of Criminal Appeal] is to accede to the Crown's desire that the respondent be sentenced more heavily, it must surmount two hurdles. The first is to locate an appellable error in the sentencing judge's discretionary decision. The second is to negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised.""


	
	The purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence. As discussed in CMB at [35], Crown appeals should be brought only to establish some matter of principle, which is to be understood as “encompassing what is necessary to avoid ... manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards” (drawn from Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; (1994) CLR 295 at 300) and to afford an opportunity for this Court to perform its proper function in laying down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts.
	
	
	In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, it was observed at [42], however, that cases might arise where the Court concludes that the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked, that it amounts to ""an affront to the administration of justice"" which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. In such a case the Court is justified in interfering with the sentence. Whether this is such a case here arises for consideration.
	
	
	This appeal raised manifest inadequacy in the context of the imposition of an aggregate sentence imposed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for a considerable number of child sex offences committed against 7 victims, over the course of some 20 years and in respect of the sentences imposed for offences involving possession and dissemination of child abuse material, a significant amount of which fell into the highest categories of seriousness.
	
	
	The eight grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown raise inadequacy in the aggregate sentence imposed for the 21 trial offences; an inadequate total non-parole period for the totality of the offending; error in granting a 15% discount for the late plea; manifestly inadequate sentences imposed for the child abuse offences; error in providing only a 6 month partial accumulation for the sentence imposed for child abuse material possession offence; error in making the sentence for the dissemination offence completely concurrent with that imposed for the possession offence; error in the finding of special circumstances; and manifest inadequacy of the overall sentence.
	


The parties’ cases


	
	The Crown’s case was that while a significant total sentence of 14 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months, was imposed, because of a number of errors in this complex sentencing exercise, the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate, given the totality of the criminality of Mr Feuerstein’s offending.
	
	
	Neither party challenged his Honour’s factual findings in relation to the trial offences, but Mr Feuerstein did not accept all of his Honour’s conclusions as to the objective seriousness of various of his offences.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s case was that his Honour had properly applied all the applicable sentencing principles which bound him; that the indicative sentences were not unduly lenient; and that both the aggregate sentence and overall sentence imposed were the result of the proper exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. It was also relevant that some of his individual offences would not have attracted a custodial sentence, had they been standalone offences.
	
	
	On Mr Feuerstein’s case there was no error in his Honour’s fact finding and that the sentence imposed properly reflected the totality of the criminality involved in his offending, as well as paying proper attention to the evidence of his subjective circumstances. The total sentence was proportionate to the total criminality of his offending and was the result of the proper application of the principle of totality. The sentence imposed was well within sentence patterns revealed by the statistics and individual indicative sentences were within the available ranges. Matters of accumulation and concurrence were within the sentencing judge’s discretion and there had been no error in his Honour’s approach, warranting the Court’s intervention on appeal, including in relation to the question of special circumstances and the need for supervision.
	
	
	On Mr Feuerstein’s approach, in the circumstances of his case, even if error were established the Court would exercise its residual discretion, particularly given the difficult circumstances under which he must serve his sentence. The Court would not tinker with the lengthy sentence already imposed upon him and in the circumstances, even if error were found, the Court would exercise its residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed upon him.
	


There was error in this sentencing exercise


	
	What reveals manifest inadequacy of a sentence which is out of the range of sentences that could have been imposed for particular offending, is a consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence (see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [60]).
	
	
	In Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 it was explained at [227] that when an aggregate sentence is imposed:
	


“... it must be remembered that the indicative head sentences cannot be the subject of an appeal to this Court. It is only the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period that can be the subject of an appeal. It follows that it is not a matter of this Court analysing each indicative sentence and determining whether it is erroneous. Rather, it is a matter of looking at the whole of the sentencing structure in order to determine whether the aggregate sentence can stand or not.”


	
	Nevertheless, an erroneous approach at the stage that specific indicative sentences are set, may reveal error in the aggregate sentenced reached (see R v Clarke [2013] NSWCCA 260 at [56]).
	
	
	In this case, after giving indicative sentences for the 21 trial offences, Haesler DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence of 14 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years, commencing on 1 June 2012 and expiring on 31 May 2021. The sentence expires on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	I consider that this aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate, for reasons which I will explain.
	
	
	That aggregate sentence was then partially accumulated on the sentence imposed for the possession of child abuse material offence, for which a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months was imposed after a 15% discount, taking into account the Form 1 weapons offence. That sentence commenced on 1 December 2011 and expired on 31 May 2014. The sentence for the dissemination of child abuse material offence was a wholly concurrent term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 1 December 2011 and expiring on 28 February 2013. Those sentences were accepted on appeal as reflecting the non-parole period imposed for each of those offences.
	
	
	Given the gravity of the child abuse material possession offence, I consider that the sentence imposed for that offence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein was the result of his Honour’s application of the principle of totality and the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I also consider that his Honour erred in the application of the principle of totality. The result of his approach to questions of concurrence and accumulation was that for the entirety of the applicant’s objectively grave offending, a non-parole period totalling only 9 years and 6 months and a total sentence of 14 years and 6 months was imposed. That was only 6 months longer than what was already an erroneously lenient aggregate sentence, for the 21 trial offences.
	
	
	The result was that the overall sentence was also manifestly inadequate and below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for these offences, consistently with applicable sentencing standards (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [24]).
	


The aggregate sentence


	
	In my view, the conclusion which Haesler DCJ reached failed to give effect to the sentencing principles which he was bound to apply, even though his Honour made extensive reference to those principles, including those which apply to historical sexual offences discussed in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50. As Button J there observed at [82], that judgment “says nothing about appropriate sentences for such offences committed today, or in the more recent past”.
	
	
	His Honour proceeded on the basis that there was a notable increase in sentences imposed after the introduction of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) and a general increase after the introduction of standard non-parole periods for some offences in 2003. The earliest of Mr Feuerstein’s offences were committed in 1991.
	
	
	His Honour noted that many of the trial offences had come to light after police found the material which became the subject of the child abuse material charges at Mr Feuerstein’s home and investigated what was thereby revealed. His Honour considered that the jury had accepted the Crown case on each count to be overwhelming. He found that while individual sentences had to be imposed for each offence, the collective impact of the offences on the victims could not be underestimated and that the Court had to recognise the harm which this offending had caused them.
	
	
	His Honour noted that each offence had occurred on a separate occasion; that where a sentence for one offence can impact the criminality of another, the sentences should be served concurrently, but that otherwise there should be at least partial accumulation to reflect the separate and distinct criminal acts committed. Care had to be taken, however, because of the compounding impact of long sentences. Nevertheless, the impression could not be given that there was some kind of discount for Mr Feuerstein’s multiple offending.
	
	
	These were undoubtedly difficult considerations to reconcile in this case. As his Honour also observed, in a case of multiple offences and different victims, the approach discussed in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 must be adhered to. That is, the final aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence, must result in a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved. That was not achieved in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The evidence at trial to which Haesler DCJ referred in his sentencing remarks, which shed light on the criminality involved in Mr Feuerstein’s offending, revealed that he had a sadistic sexual interest in young boys. His youngest victim was aged 8 years. His offences took place between 1991 and 2011. In 2011 he came to the attention of police who investigated, with the result that there the child abuse material was discovered, which led the police to other victims.
	
	
	By that time, the seriousness of his offending had increased to the point where Mr Feuerstein’s last offence involved anal intercourse with a sleeping child. The 21 trial offences had each involved young boys, who Mr Feuerstein knew to be vulnerable for various reasons. He manipulated his victims in various different ways, in order to put them into the position where he was able to commit serious offences upon each of them. Many of these offences involved caning, some resulting in physical injury. That was an aspect of those offences which had to be taken into account on sentencing. In some cases the young victims were given alcohol. In others they were drugged. Mr Feuerstein kept written and in some cases photographic records of what he did to his victims. He also wrote stories fantasising about what he had done and wished to do. From those records it would appear that there were other victims.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was at one time a police officer. For many years he worked as a security guard. He finally obtained work as a youth case worker with a reputable youth support agency, in order, his Honour found, to gain access to young boys, he having lied about his good character and interest in the welfare of young people. It was then that the offences against JC, his final victim, were committed. In 2011, while JC was at Mr Feuerstein’s home, in abuse of his position and the result of pressure and bribes, he made JC suck his penis (count 24). On a later night JC woke to find that Mr Feuerstein had placed his penis inside his anus, albeit for only a short period, because he objected (count 25).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for both these s 61J offences was 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10. In R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, the effect of the introduction of the standard non-parole period was explained generally to be increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies. They became one of the statutory guideposts which had to be taken into account in the case of such offences, together with the maximum penalty for the offence (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]).
	
	
	For the fellatio offence the indicative sentence was 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. By comparison, for the anal intercourse offence the indicative sentence was 8 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years. The latter was a very lenient a sentence in the circumstances, given the victim’s age; the breach of trust involved in the abuse of Mr Feuerstein’s position of authority; and that it has long been recognised that an offence of this kind is further aggravated by the degrading nature of anal intercourse, even though such an offence, in any circumstance is, of its nature, always degrading. (see R v Russell (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 21 June 1996 unrep) These were all factors which had to be taken into account in assessing where this particular sexual assault offence lay on the spectrum or scale of seriousness (see Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; (1987) 163 CLR 447).
	
	
	There were six other victims involved in Mr Feuerstein’s 19 other trial offences. The indicative sentences imposed for those offences ranged from 6 months, for three offences committed in 2007, when Mr Feuerstein caned JK (counts 20, 21 and 23), to 5 years for the anal intercourse offence against JD in 1998 (count 6) and 4 years for the first fellatio offence committed against JC (a different victim), in 1991 (count 1).
	
	
	There were no standard non-parole periods applying to Mr Feuerstein’s offences, before those committed in 2007. Counts 1 and 6 each attracted maximum penalties of 20 years. The 1991 offence against JC, then aged 12 or 13, occurred when he stayed overnight at Mr Feuerstein’s home. He was given drink and a “red pill” and later woke to find Mr Feuerstein sucking his penis. He passed out and when he woke again, found that Mr Feuerstein had ejaculated on his chest. The 1998 anal intercourse offence, involved Mr Feuerstein paying JD, then aged 14.
	
	
	The caning offences against JK each attracted a maximum penalty of 7 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. They included counts 19 and 22, when JK was caned on his bare buttocks, a sentence of 1 year, with a non-parole period of 9 months were imposed.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed also encompassed 19 other offences, involving 4 other victims, for which the indicative sentences ranged from 4 years to 6 months.
	
	
	The result of his Honour’s approach was that, notwithstanding the indicative sentences given for these 21, separate offences involving 7 different victims, an aggregate non-parole period of only 9 years and a total sentence of 14, was imposed. Given the criminality involved in all of this offending; the serious criminality involved in some of the individual offences, reflected in the higher indicative sentences given; and Mr Feuerstein's significant moral culpability for what he did, notwithstanding the evidence as to his subjective circumstances, the conditions under which he would serve his sentence and the conclusions which his Honour reached as to special circumstances, the error in his Honour’s conclusion as to that aggregate sentence is, in my view, manifest.
	
	
	As his Honour observed, the total non-parole period finally imposed had to reflect the minimum period of actual incarceration that Mr Feuerstein had to spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his crimes and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629).
	
	
	The 9 year non-parole period was in my view an insufficient minimum period of incarceration, for the overall criminality involved in this serious offending. That error was compounded by his Honour’s approach to the sentences imposed for the two offences to which pleas were entered and to the application of the principle of totality, in arriving at an overall sentence for the entirety of Mr Feuerstein’s offending.
	


The child abuse material offences


	
	In his sentencing remarks, his Honour did not refer to the agreed facts, which revealed how very serious the two offences to which Mr Feuerstein entered his late pleas were.
	
	
	The agreed facts revealed that the electronic material found at Mr Feuerstein’s home in December 2011 included some 37,000 still images and 800 videos falling into every category of the Child Exploitation Tracking Scheme, including category 4, (depicting penetrative sexual activity between children and adults) and category 5, (depicting sadism, bestiality or humiliation).
	
	
	The print material was some 2,507 images of boys aged between 8 and 12 years in various stages of undress or naked, taken at Mr Feuerstein’s residence. Some of these images had been downloaded from the internet. Others were taken by Mr Feuerstein and had notations written on them, with dates and descriptions. There were photos of boys with their penises and buttocks exposed, some with welt marks from caning. Some were taken without the children being aware.
	
	
	The bulk of the 13 written stories found by police were categorised as level 5, the rest 2 and 3. There was also a punishment book found, recording punishment Mr Feuerstein had administered, listing 29 different boys ranging from 9 to 18 years, but mainly aged 12 to 13. It recorded the number of cane strokes administered and where. One was dated from December 1999 to February 2009. The other from January 2001 to February 2009. Three personal diaries provided further information about these incidents, including fondling boys’ genitals, as well as fantasies about the boys in the punishment books. The agreed facts provided examples of these entries. A consent form designed to be signed by boys who were to be caned, was also found.
	
	
	The dissemination charge related to email communications of a sexual nature between August and September 2006 to a male in the United States, in which naked pictures of identified victims and others were provided.
	
	
	The Form 1 weapons offence related to six handcuffs and an extendable baton also found at Mr Feuerstein’s home. Ten canes of varying lengths and thicknesses were also found there, but were not the subject of this charge.
	
	
	For the late plea entered to these two offences a 15% discount was given, Haesler DCJ concluding that “there was still some utilitarian value in them”. That was plainly a very favourable result, given that it was observed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2009] NSWCCA 309 at [65] per Spigelman CJ at [154] - [156] and [160] that there should be a discount towards the bottom of the range for late pleas such as those entered on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. There was nothing of that kind here.
	
	
	His Honour considered that these two offences were of considerable gravity and moral culpability, noting that there were actual children used in the depictions, with over 1000 falling within the two worst categories. He considered that general deterrence was important in sentencing for these offences. He also considered it relevant that some of the material was fantasy, which was not as serious as that involving actual children. That observation was directed at parts of the written material the subject of the charge, not the images.
	
	
	Despite these conclusions, the result of his Honour’s approach was a sentence for the very serious possession of child abuse material offence, with an effective non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and for the dissemination offence an effective non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. That period had to adequately reflect Mr Feuerstein’ moral culpability for his offending (see GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96 at [12]; McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [28] - [29]). The sentence imposed did not do so.
	
	
	Proper regard was not paid to what had been discussed in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [41] - [44], as to the particular need for deterrence, in offences of this kind. Given the very serious nature of many of these images and videos, it had to be borne in that:
	


“41    In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material.

42    What makes the crime callous is not just that it exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes.

43    And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.

44    It is for that reason that this is a crime in respect of which general deterrence is of particular significance. In my opinion the sentencing judge too readily dismissed from consideration the need to convey the very serious manner in which courts view possession of child pornography.”


	
	The conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate is reinforced when consideration is given to the role which the Form 1 offence had to play in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	That offence had to be taken into account with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate. As discussed in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42], that had to be done firstly, by greater weight being given to the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the possession offence indicated. Secondly, by giving greater weight to the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for Mr Feuerstein’s serious offences.
	
	
	The 2 years and 6 months non-parole period imposed for the possession offence revealed that these considerations were also not given sufficient weight.
	
	
	The sentence was, in my view, manifestly inadequate, given the objective seriousness of this offence, Mr Feuerstein’s moral culpability for his offending, the account which had to be taken of the Form 1 offence and the role which both general and specific deterrence had to play in this sentence.
	


The overall sentence


	
	When these errors are considered together with his Honour’s approach to the principle of totality, which resulted in the sentence for the dissemination offence being made totally concurrent with the sentence for the possession offence and all but 6 months of that sentence being made concurrent with the already inadequate aggregate sentence, the manifest inadequacy of the overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein is stark.
	
	
	The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship between individual sentences and severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence, as his Honour observed (see R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15] - [18]). Nor should a crushing sentence that will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release be imposed on an offender (see MAK at [17]). What such a sentence is, must be determined, however, by reference to the offences committed, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality (see Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; (2011) 219 A Crim R 104).
	
	
	Questions of accumulation and concurrency must be determined by reference to the question of whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of another offence (see R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] and [13]). Relevant considerations include the number of victims and whether the offences committed against each occurred on separate occasions (see Van Der Baan v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 5 at [117]).
	
	
	Here, the criminality involved in the child abuse material offences was not comprehended by the offences dealt with at trial. Certainly the images included some images of victims of the trial offences, but given the number and nature of those images and what was involved in these offences by comparison to those dealt with at trial, there was no question of double punishment for common elements of Mr Feuerstein’s offending of the kind considered in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [40].
	
	
	The sentencing discretion, in my view, miscarried, with the result a manifestly inadequate sentence for the criminality involved in the entirety of Mr Feuerstein’s offending. In the result the appeal must be upheld.
	


The residual discretion


	
	The sentence imposed being erroneously lenient, consideration must, nevertheless, be given to whether the residual discretion should be exercised in this case. The Crown accepted that it had to establish that the residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein, should not be exercised. Mr Feuerstein’s case was that it had not satisfied that onus.
	
	
	It is not only the considerable inadequacy of the sentence which must be considered at this point, but also other matters, such as the delay since Mr Feuerstein was sentenced, although there was here no delay by the Crown in lodging the appeal (see R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [60]; R (Cth) v Cheung; R (Cth) v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244; (2010) 203 A Crim R 398 at [151]; R v Hersi [2010] NSWCCA 57 at [55]). The fact that the sentences for the child abuse material offences has already expired, is also relevant (see Hernando at [30]).
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s subjective circumstances, particularly while in custody, about which further evidence was received on appeal, must also be considered. In determining whether to exercise the discretion, the Court is not required to put itself back in the position of the sentencing judge at the moment of conviction, but must take into account this further evidence (see R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154 at [19]; R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562).
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein’s release on parole is not imminent. He was sentenced on 28 November 2013 and the appeal was lodged in December 2013. One ground was then advanced: manifest inadequacy. The grounds were amended on 3 November 2014, to raise 7 additional grounds. The appeal was heard on 24 November 2014. Further evidence was then received. An affidavit sworn on 11 December 2014 by Mr Michie, a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the conditions of Mr Feuerstein’s custody, dealt with in the affidavit which he had sworn on 20 November 2014, was received in December 2014. Further submissions were received in March 2015.
	
	
	The sentences imposed for the child abuse material offences commenced on 1 December 2011. They have both expired, the possession sentence on 31 May 2014, long before the hearing of the appeal. The aggregate sentence for the other 21 offences commenced on 1 June 2012 and is due to expire on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	The 9 year non-parole period imposed on Mr Feuerstein for the trial offences commenced on 1 June 2012 and is due to expire on 31 May 2021. His sentence expires on 31 May 2026.
	
	
	Haesler DCJ’s finding of special circumstances rested on his conclusion as to the accumulation of the sentences imposed and the period Mr Feuerstein would require to adjust to normal community life on release, while under close supervision for “the longer the better”. His Honour took into account his subjective case, which included evidence of health problems which might increase while he remained in custody and to evidence that as a convicted sex offender and former police officer, he would spend time in protection, which his Honour found imposed harsher regimes for any prisoner, especially in respect of non-association, lockdowns and the ongoing fear of physical attack. The evidence led on appeal shed further light on the conditions under which Mr Feuerstein would serve his sentence.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein was aged 52 when he swore his affidavit, where he attested to the conditions of his custodial history, protective custody while on remand and movement to a segregation unit after conviction. He referred to circumstances of a disciplinary charge and complaints he had made to the NSW Ombudsman, his removal from protective custody and threats received from other inmates, given his past professions, one of which resulted in a physical attack. He was then housed in protective custody with other sex offenders, with little access to training programs. His health problems continued.
	
	
	Mr Michie’s affidavit, to which was annexed relevant records, confirmed relevant aspects of this account. There was in the result no issue between the parties that the conditions of Mr Feuerstein’s custody will be harsher than that of other prisoners.
	
	
	Bearing all of these matters in mind, I have come to the conclusion that while the overall sentence imposed on Mr Feuerstein is so inadequate that it amounts to “an affront to the administration of justice”, the residual discretion not to interfere in the sentence imposed in relation to the child abuse offences should be exercised. That conclusion follows from the delay, which has had the result that Mr Feuerstein has already served the entirety of the sentences imposed for those two offences.
	
	
	The same conclusion is not available in relation to the aggregate sentence for the trial offences which, in my view, must be set aside and Mr Feuerstein resentenced. To do otherwise in all of the circumstances I have discussed would, in my view, result in an affront to justice.
	


Resentencing


	
	Section 68A(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) prohibits the Court from imposing a less severe sentence on an appeal such as this, than would otherwise be considered appropriate, because of any element of double jeopardy involved in a respondent being sentenced again, or on the basis of any distress and anxiety suffered by a respondent (see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49).
	
	
	In this case, on resentencing, it is necessary to take into account that it has long been considered that safety while in prison is a relevant consideration on sentencing(see York v The Queen [2001] HCA 60; (2005) 225 CLR 466); that every year in protective custody is equivalent to a longer loss of liberty under ordinary conditions of imprisonment (see AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; (1999) 198 CLR 111); and that custody for former police officers will involve a greater degree of hardship than might otherwise be the case (see R v Jones and Kelly (1985) 20 A Crim R 142).
	
	
	The evidence received on appeal from Mr Feuerstein, corroborated by that led by the Crown, sheds further light on the considerably difficult circumstances under which Mr Feuerstein will continue to serve his sentence, given his former occupations. That evidence must be taken into account, by ameliorating the sentence which would otherwise be imposed upon him.
	
	
	I will not reiterate the circumstances of the trial offences, which I have earlier discussed, or all of the other relevant matters I have earlier referred to. I agree with Haesler DCJ’s conclusion that Mr Feuerstein should have an extended period of supervision once released on parole, given his need for strict supervision when so released.
	
	
	For the trial offences, I would resentence Mr Feuerstein to a total non-parole period of 11 years and a total term of 16 years. This reflects indicative sentences which do not depart from those indicated by Haesler DCJ, but with less concurrency than his Honour concluded was appropriate, resulting in an inadequate aggregate sentence for that total criminality involved in those 21 offences.
	
	
	I also consider that in the circumstances, for reasons already explained, that the application of the principle of totality should not result in any concurrency between the fixed term sentences imposed for the child abuse offences, the last of which expired on 31 May 2014, with the result that the aggregate term should commence on 30 May 2014, with the non-parole period expiring on 29 May 2025. The sentence would then expire on 29 May 2030.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons given, the orders I would make are:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by the District Court on 28 November 2013 for the trial offences are set aside.
	
	
	Mr Feuerstein is resentenced to an aggregate sentence for the trial offences commencing on 30 May 2014 with a total term of 16 years, expiring on 30 May 2030 and a non-parole period of 11 years expiring on 30 May 2025.

12112,2764515,North Coast Children's Home Inc. trading as Child & Adolescent Specialist Programs & Accommodation (CASPA) v Martin [2014] NSWDC 125,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiffs, by statement of claim filed on 4 December 2013, bring proceedings for defamation arising from twelve publications made by the plaintiff. Seven were published on a Facebook account known as ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"". The remaining five are emails.

2These publications were made between 19 August 2013 and 11 September 2013. Some of the Internet publications remained accessible as late as 5 December 2013, when they were taken down by the operator of the ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"" account holder, Mr Tommy Campion.

The parties

3The first plaintiff is an incorporated not for profit organisation providing services for disadvantaged children in the form of foster care services and an accommodation facility at Lismore, known as the North Coast Children's Home. The second plaintiff was employed by the first plaintiff as the Manager of Foster Care Services and the third plaintiff is the Chief Executive Officer of the first plaintiff.

4The defendant is a 71-year-old retired former foster carer who applied to the first plaintiff seeking approval (together with his wife) as foster carers. Following approval of the defendant and his wife as registered carers in September 2012, a child was placed with them but, following the defendant becoming dissatisfied with the first plaintiff's conduct of the foster care services, the defendant and his wife discontinued the care of the child in December 2012. The defendant's services were engaged intermittently by the plaintiff for several months thereafter, but their work association had broken down by May 2013. Following this, the defendant commenced publishing the matters complained of.

The background to this litigation

5The North Coast Children's Home has a long history, although the involvement of the plaintiffs in carrying out their present roles is, as is set out in more detail below, very recent. 

6The North Coast Children's Home was first set up in 1919, when two young orphaned and neglected children were given into the care of the Vicar of St Andrews, the Reverend A. R. Ebbs. Those children were given temporary shelter until a local resident, a Mr George Barnard, offered the children the use of a house which he owned in Lismore, free of rent. There was public interest in the establishment of an orphanage in the town of Lismore. The placement of children at the Home continued, but its structure was not formalised until 1951, when a constitution for the home was prepared (Exhibit F to the affidavit of Mr Todd Yourell, 3 July 2014). The Management Committee was not incorporated, until 16 May 1989, when the relevant documents were lodged at the Corporate Affairs Commission registry in accordance with the Associations Incorporations Act 1984 (NSW).

7Mr Yourell's affidavit sets out that the Church of England's role in relation to the Home continued, but on a restricted basis. Since 1989, the Bishop of the Diocese of Grafton has held powers enabling him to appoint up to four members of the Board of Governance, which is responsible for the affairs of the first plaintiff (hereafter referred to as ""CASPA""). The Board of Governance is responsible for the affairs of CASPA and acts in the interests of CASPA. Prior to incorporation in 1989 the Anglican Diocese of Grafton was responsible for the affairs of North Coast Children's Home.

8It was while the Anglican Diocese of Grafton was responsible for the affairs of North Coast Children's Home, prior to 1989, that substantial and serious abuse of children at the home occurred. Orphaned and neglected children in the care of the home were victims of sexual, physical and psychological abuse. As is common in relation to victims of institution-based abuse, there were few complaints at the time, and those which were made were ignored, disbelieved and/or discouraged. 

9The Anglican Diocese of Grafton received a number of complaints in 2006 about historical acts of physical, sexual and psychological abuse at the North Coast Children's Home in Lismore, all of which occurred between the 1940s and 1980s. Thirty-nine of those claims were settled through negotiated payments. Two of those persons did not participate in the settlement, and instead brought proceedings. Seven others later came forward with similar claims. The Right Reverend Keith Slater, who acknowledged that he did not pass on all the complaints to the Church's Professional Standards Director as was required, resigned as Bishop in May 2013.

10While the nature and extent of the abuses which occurred are the subject of current inquiry and evidence, the nature and extent of the inquiry currently being undertaken by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse (""the Royal Commission"") relates to periods well before the employment of the second and third plaintiff, and well before the first plaintiff, which is no longer a part of the Anglican Church but a separate organisation. It is neither controlled by, nor answerable to, the Anglican Church. As Mr Yourell points out in paragraphs 20-24 of his affidavit (Exhibit F), the Royal Commission is considering a case study of the home during its operation by the Anglican Church in the 1960s and 1970s, more than 40 years ago, but not into its present operation.

The publications

11The publications fall into the following categories:

(a)The Facebook publications;

(b)The complaint to the Director of Professional Standards;

(c)The emails to foster carers;

(d)The email to the second and third plaintiffs;

(e)The email to Fostering New South Wales on the Fostering New South Wales website.

12I shall deal with each in turn.

(a) The Facebook Publications

13The Facebook publications were seven posts on a site headed ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"". The site was hosted by Mr Tommy Campion, who wrote about the abuse he suffered while an occupant of the home, 30 to 40 years ago, his claims for compensation and recognition of that abuse, and the impending inquiry into those events by the Royal Commission, at which Mr Campion gave evidence. The site had a large and active following. Although counsel for the plaintiffs' written submissions state that the Facebook page had a ""membership of over 280 individuals"" this is in fact the number of ""likes"" recorded on the page at a particular time. Nevertheless, this was a site that was of significant interest for anyone interested in the evidence being heard before the Royal Commission in relation to the historic abuse claims in the 1960s and 1970s.

14Each of the matters complained of published on the Facebook website page made allegations, not about an identified connection to the historic abuse claims such as Mr Campion's, but of incompetence, dishonesty and neglect. Generalised claims of ""abuse"" were also made. The relevant imputations are as follows:

The first matter complained of - 19 August 2013

15The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 5-8, 12);

(b)The first plaintiff neglects the children under its care (Lines 7-12);

(c)The first plaintiff abuses the children under its care (Line 10).

The second matter complained of - 26 August 2013

16The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 1-4, 6-7, 16-23);

(b)The first plaintiff engages in child abuse (Lines 6-7, 14, 38);

(c)The first plaintiff neglects the children in its care (Lines 9-13, 40-44);

(d)The first plaintiff abuses foster carers engaged by the first plaintiff (Lines 19-20).

The fifth matter complained of - 30 September 2013

17The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff does not care about the children in its care (Lines 4-5, 27-29);

(b)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 4-5, 27-28);

(c)The third plaintiff misuses the funds given to the first plaintiff for the care of children (Lines 1-17); 

(d)The third plaintiff is not qualified to manage the first plaintiff (Lines 17-19).

The sixth matter complained of - 17 October 2013

18The imputations are:

(a)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 15-18, 20-21);

(b)The third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 20-21).

The ninth matter complained of - 13 November 2013

19The imputations are:

(a)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 2-14);

(b)the third plaintiff does not care about the children in the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 2-14);

(c)the first plaintiff does not care about the children in its (Lines 2-14).

The tenth matter complained of - 19 November 2013

20The imputations are:

(a)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 6-9);

(b)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 6-9);

(c)the first plaintiff does not care about the children in its care (Lines 6-9);

(d)the third plaintiff does not care about the children in the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 6-9); 

(e)the third plaintiff is a child abuser (Lines 6-9).

The eleventh matter complained of - 19 November 2013

21The imputations are:

(a)the first plaintiff neglects the children in its care (Lines 1-4);

(b)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 1-6);

(c)the first plaintiff lies to the foster carers it engages (Lines 4-6);

(d)the first plaintiff abuses the children in its care (Lines 5-6).

22Although the allegation made by the defendant were principally of dishonesty and neglect, imputations of abuse of children occur in imputations arising from the first, second, tenth and eleventh publications. These are the most serious imputations.

(b) The complaint to the Director of Professional Standards

23The third matter complained of is a complaint to Mr Michael Elliott, Director of Professional Standards, Anglican Diocese of Newcastle/Armidale/Grafton. The imputations conveyed are as follows:

(a)the third plaintiff is a bully (Lines 12-14);

(b)the third plaintiff does not care about complaints made about the first plaintiff's foster care services (Lines 12-14);

(c)the second plaintiff deserves to be dismissed from her employment with the first plaintiff (Lines 15, 55, 83);

(d)the third plaintiff deserves to be dismissed from his employment with the first plaintiff (Lines 15, 55, 83);

(e)The first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 35-36, 37-40);

(f)The first plaintiff neglects the children under its care (Lines 43-48, 53-54, 66, 69-71).

24I note that Mr Elliott responded on the same day, stating that CASPA, the first plaintiff, was an organisation independent of the Anglican Diocese of Grafton, the complaint did not fall within his jurisdiction, and that the historical complaints of abuse regarding the North Coast Children's Home were unrelated to the activities of CASPA. The significance of these remarks appears to have been lost upon the defendant.

(c) The emails to foster carers

25The defendant sent two emails to other foster carers dated 27 September and 29 October 2013, respectively. The first of these conveyed the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff is a dishonest organisation (Lines 6-7, 12-14, 21-22, 50-53);

(b)the second plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 40-46);

(c)the second plaintiff does not care about the children under the care of the first plaintiff (Lines 76-78);

(d)the first plaintiff is managed by persons who are not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91);

(e)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91);

(f)the third plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 87-91).

The eighth matter complained of 

26The eighth matter complained of contained the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff has engaged in child abuse (Lines 10-11);

(b)the first plaintiff engages in intimidatory behaviour (Lines 24-25);

(c)the first plaintiff has a bad reputation (Lines 28-32);

(d)the first plaintiff runs a children's home which is cruel to children (Lines 28-32);

(e)the first plaintiff runs a children's home which engages in sexual abuse of children (Lines 28-32);

(f)the second plaintiff treats foster carers badly (Lines 33-35);

(g)the first plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 36-42);

(h)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 36-42);

(i)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 51-56);

(j)the third plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 51-55);

(k)the first plaintiff does not look after children in its care (Lines 92-94);

(l)the first plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115, 119-123);

(m)the second plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115);

(n)the third plaintiff is engaged in a scam (Lines 60-88, 106-115, 119-123);

(o)the first plaintiff will not be allocated any more children for its care (Lines 115-118).

27The exact number of emails which were circulated on each occasion is unknown to the plaintiffs. The first email is addressed to Robyn Dwyer, a foster carer for the first plaintiff and according to the affidavit of Naarah Rodwell sworn on 24 April 2014 this email was also received by Alan and Sue Bugeja, who were foster carers for the first plaintiff, and by Mr and Mrs Crosby, who were foster carers for another organisation described as ""UPA"". Ms Dwyer read the email on the telephone to the second plaintiff, which she found very distressing, and the following day she received a telephone call from Angela Reid of UPA who informed her that carers at UPA had also received this email.

28The eighth matter complained of is addressed to an Internet address for Mr Alan Bugeja, and the affidavit evidence of the plaintiffs is that this email was sent to other carers as well.

(d) The defendant's email to the second and third plaintiffs

29The defendant sent an email to the second and third plaintiffs conveying the following imputations:

(a)the second plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 11-30, 40-42, 43-52, 54, 75-77);

(b)the second plaintiff is incompetent to provide foster care services (Lines11-25, 49-50);

(c)the third plaintiff is incompetent to provide foster care services (Lines 53-54);

(d)the third plaintiff is dishonest (Lines 70-72, 75-77).

30The question of whether there is publication to a third party where an email is sent to one plaintiff, who then shows it to another plaintiff, rests upon uncertain ground. There may be exceptional cases where an email addressed to all the plaintiffs may amount to publication to third parties, as occurred in Zarth v Williamson [2006] NSWCA 246. Although counsel for the plaintiff says that this email was copied to the second plaintiff, that is not apparent from the email letterhead. The second plaintiff may be entitled to complain about this publication concerning her capabilities made to the third plaintiff, but I cannot see that the third plaintiff has any cause of action at all. In practical terms, given the number of publications, this publication adds little and I propose to err on the side of caution and to disregard it.

(e) Email to Fostering New South Wales on the Fostering New South Wales website

31On 11 September 2013 the defendant forwarded an email to Fostering New South Wales which the plaintiffs plead conveyed the following imputations:

(a)the first plaintiff had no staff qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 11-15); 

(b)the first plaintiff is associated with child abuse (Lines 11-13);

(c)the second plaintiff is not qualified to provide foster care services (Lines 11-15).

The defendant's role in these proceedings

32As the plaintiffs were unable to serve the defendant at his home address, they applied to this Court, ex parte, during the court vacation (on 24 January 2014). An order for substituted service was made retrospectively for service on the defendant at the email address from which he had forwarded the emails. Substituted service was also effected in accordance with this order on the defendant's post office box.

33The defendant had no notice of this ex parte application, and scant notice of the first return date of these proceedings before Bozic SC DCJ on 28 February 2014. 

34On 28 February 2014, the plaintiffs, according to Exhibit B, asked the Court to enter default judgment against the defendant, on the basis that no defence had been filed, relying upon the affidavit of Mr Ware, the solicitor for the plaintiffs, sworn 27 February 2014. Bozic SC DCJ considered it was appropriate for a notice of motion to be filed seeking orders for judgment. The solicitor appearing for the plaintiffs asked the Court, if the Court was not prepared to enter judgment, to make an order for the defendant to file a defence within 14 days but his Honour was not prepared to do so. His Honour made the following orders:

(1)Notice of motion seeking orders for judgment to be served on the defendant by email.

(2)Notice of motion listed for hearing on 14 March 2014.

35Although not ordered to do so by Levy SC DCJ on 24 January 2014, the plaintiffs had notified the defendant of that return date on 31 January 2014. They also notified him of the subsequent hearing date for the application for default (or summary) judgment, namely 14 March 2014.

36On 26 February 2014, a copy of what has been described by the defendant as a ""defence"" was provided to the solicitors for the plaintiffs by hand delivery to their office. This document, which is annexure D to the affidavit of Mr Ware of 27 February 2014 is a discursive narrative; it first asserts that the first plaintiff is ""disqualified"" from commencing proceedings as it was incorporated and a ""for profit organisation"", being part of the ""billion dollar organisation"" of the Church of England. The defendant states that the emails only went to a few people, that he did not give permission for them to be distributed beyond the recipients, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any damages, and that he proposed to plead justification, contextual truth, privilege and ""fair comment"", although no such pleadings were appended.

37The defendant's response to the proposed listing of the application for default judgment on 14 March 2014 was to say that he was in poor health, did not have sufficient funds to retain a lawyer and was not able to come to Sydney. He requested a re-scheduling of the hearing.

38When the matter came before Bozic SC DCJ on 14 March 2014, his Honour made the following orders:

(1)Judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant.

(2)Damages to be assessed.

(3)Costs.

(4)That the proceedings proceed to trial for damages to be assessed.

(5)Matter stood over to 28 March 2014 for allocation of a hearing date.

(6)Defendant to be notified by plaintiffs of orders made today.

39There is a note on the court file that ""short oral reasons"" were given, but these are not available. A letter from the plaintiff's solicitors' city agents (Exhibit C) noted the contents of those reasons. This letter, which was tendered, sets out that his Honour viewed the defendant's comments about future legal representation and ill health (and presumably his request for an adjournment) as evidencing that there was no likelihood the defendant would in the near future take any part in the legal proceedings. His Honour also stated that the defendant should not conduct his case through email correspondence, as opposed to filing documents in Court. As no defence (including the ""defence"" sent to the plaintiff's solicitors, but not the court) had been filed, judgment was entered.

40On 28 March 2014, Bozic SC DCJ made the following orders, and gave a hearing date for the assessment of damages in the defamation list and not in the general list:

(1)Parties to file and serve any affidavit material as to the issue of damages by 28 April 2014.

(2)Parties to file and serve submissions by 19 May 2014.

(3)Matter is listed for hearing (in relation to the default judgment) on 25 July 2014.

(4)Plaintiffs are to notify the defendant of these orders.

41On 1 April 2014 the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant, notifying him of the hearing on 25 July 2014 and on 28 April 2014 served their affidavits on damages. The plaintiff's written submissions on damages were served on 24 June 2014. A reply from the defendant dated 24 June 2014 contained statements of an abusive nature, threats to go to the media, and repetitions of the libel (Exhibit D).

42A further affidavit was sent on 2 July, resulting in an email response from the defendant, saying: ""I hope your client understands what they are unleashing, it may well end as a media frenzy"" (affidavit of Mr Ware, Exhibit D).

43The defendant has provided written submissions as to damages to the Court by post, email and fax. As to damages, the defendant submitted that none of the plaintiffs should be awarded any damages, for reasons set out in more detail below.

The remaining issues in this litigation

44Issues such as the capacity of imputations, and the entitlement of the first plaintiff to bring an action for defamation at all, are relevant to liability and not to quantum. This is one of the reasons why default judgment is, as a rule, not entered in defamation proceedings: French v Triple M Melbourne Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 36, citing Altarama Ltd v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188. Applications for default judgment in defamation have on occasions been adverted to as possible: see Northumbrian Ice Cream Co Ltd v Breakaway Vending Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1216 at [1], [11]-[12] (application refused on other grounds); Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McCallum J, 2 December 2013, unreported). 

45Such applications are increasingly common in defamation proceedings; for example, in Petrov v Do [2013] NSWSC 1382, where the defendants were a Macedonian newspaper and a person resident in Macedonia, default judgment was entered after no defence was filed, and the damages awarded (totalling $350,000) are the highest amount of general damages awarded under the Act. Other recent examples of default judgment applications resulting in an assessment of damages include Ritson v Burns [2014] NSWSC 272; Stevens v Mayberry [2012] SASC 220; Leech v Green & Gold Energy Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 999. The short gaps between the default judgment application and the listing for hearing suggests these hearings bypass case management or list judge lists. Attempts to set aside default or summary judgments of this kind been unsuccessful: Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244; Dossis v Andreadis [2012] SADC 104. 

46More recently, perhaps in response to the increasing number of applications for default judgment, the courts have sounded a warning note. Beech-Jones J expressed concern, in Graham v Powell (No 3) 2014 NSWSC 185 at [6] of the ""risk of oppression"" in entering a default judgment against a litigant in person who cannot file a defence in proper form. Beech-Jones J warned of the need for caution before striking out a defence of this kind (at [6]), although his Honour went on to do so after satisfying himself that publication was not in dispute and the imputations clearly arose (at [7] - [9]). His Honour did not consider it necessary to consider the issue of whether there was any defence to the claim. 

47In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies [2011] NSWSC 1445, the more cautious course was taken, where no defence had been filed, of listing the matter for hearing on all issues, recording attempts to locate the defendant, putting forward the allegations of fact made by the plaintiff as having been taken to be admitted (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") r 14.16) and setting out each part of the plaintiff's claim, in the same manner which would be used for an unrepresented litigant (see also Higgins v Sinclair [2011] NSWSC 163 at [66]). In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies, supra, Latham J considered the standing of the plaintiff (which, like the first plaintiff in these proceedings, needed to establish that it was an excluded corporation by reason of s 9(2)(b) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)), imputations (including both capacity and defamatory meaning) and whether publication and identification had been established. 

48That is not the case here. Effectively, none of those tasks may be performed by me, as this is an assessment hearing for damages only, by reason of the entry of default judgment by Bozic SC DCJ.

49The defendant effectively had two months' notice that proceedings had been commenced before judgment was entered. In practical terms, he may have had less, as it would appear that he did not consult his email or mailbox until 31 January 2014, which would explain the circumstances in which he was surprised to find these documents when they were sent to him on 31 January 2014. As January is generally a holiday period, and the defendant said he did not regularly consult his email, I am prepared to assume that while he was served on 10 January 2014, he did not receive any practical or actual notice of these proceedings until the email of 31 January 2014.

50The defendant did not attend Court on 28 February, when the application for default judgment was made. Nor did he attend Court on 14 March 2014 when judgment was entered against him. He was aware, in my view, of both these hearings. I take into account that he told the Court of his ill health and asked for an adjournment of the 14 March hearing, but these were matters which were clearly put before Bozic SC DCJ and rejected by his Honour, who on the day had the benefit of oral submissions from the city agent for the plaintiff's solicitors as to the history of these proceedings: Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd, supra.

51There has been no application to set aside or appeal (see Coren, supra) the orders made by Bozic SC DCJ. I have carefully examined the affidavits sworn by Mr Ware, including his affidavits of 27 February and 4 March, the affidavit of Ms Cripps Clark of 12 March and the correspondence from the solicitors for the plaintiffs to the defendant prior to the commencement of proceedings. I am satisfied the defendant knew what those orders were, and have been guided by the principles of law and case management set out in Coren v Master Builders Assn of New South Wales Pty Ltd, supra, at [16] et passim.

52I am further satisfied, from the evidence set out in these affidavits, that the defendant was well aware that proceedings were likely if he continued to publish. On 30 September 2013, the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to him, demanding that all defamatory communications should cease, that he should retract all statements and that he should retract the imputations conveyed in the publications he was making. On 2 October 2013 the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant providing a list of defamatory imputations and seeking an undertaking from him that he cease making them, including foreshadowing proceedings for injunctive relief, damages and costs.

53The defendant replied on 3 October 2013, arguing his case and refusing to give any such undertakings. Despite receiving this correspondence, he went on to publish the sixth to twelfth matters complained of, over the next two months. This included further postings on the ""Tommy versus Anglican Church"" page, which Mr Tommy Campion agreed, on 5 December 2013, to remove, adding:

""I thought I had blocked him. I'll have another look. Sorry about that. Todd [the defendant] is a nuisance."" (Exhibit M)

54The intemperate response of the defendant to the requests to cease making these posts has been repeated in his correspondence following the commencement of these proceedings. The submissions he has provided to the Court are, like his ""defence"" (which was in fact never lodged with the Court), a generalised smear of the plaintiffs, interspersed with threats of contacting the media.

55It is generally the case with proceedings in this Court that parties are encouraged to attend mediation or otherwise endeavour to resolve their differences without the cost and expense of a hearing. In the present case, Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that any prospect of mediation is hopeless.

56While I am concerned at the rapidity with which the proceedings moved from commencement to final judgment, I can understand the response of Bozic SC DCJ to the defendant's intemperate correspondence. Finally, and most tellingly, no application has been made to me to adjourn the hearing date, nor has the defendant sought to set aside the judgment and file a defence, which he could have done at any time prior to the hearing. 

57Accordingly, I have proceeded with the assessment of damages on the basis of the evidence before me. That evidence has included the defendant's written submissions, which I have marked Exhibit 1, which I have taken into account both in relation to the circumstances in which this case has proceeded to assessment as well as on the issue of damages.

58The defendant does not answer the claim for damages by the second and third defendants beyond repeating the defamatory allegations, in terms which must (in relation to the second and third defendants, who seek aggravated compensatory damages) substantially aggravate the damage caused.

Damages

59Section 34 of the Act provides that the amount of damages awarded must bear an approximate and rational relationship with the harm done. The amount currently gazetted as at 1 July 2014 is $366,000 (s 35). No apology or correction by the defendant in mitigation of the award of damages has been provided (s 38).

60The purpose of an award of damages in defamation is threefold. First there is the consolation for personal distress and hurt caused to each plaintiff. Secondly, there is reparation for damage to the plaintiff's reputation and thirdly, there is the issue of vindication. In practical terms, these purposes overlap: Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [60].

61The first plaintiff is a corporation and the plaintiff acknowledges it cannot recover damages for hurt to feelings: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Comalco Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 510, or for aggravated damages: NRMA Insurance Ltd v Flanagan [1982] 1 NSWLR 585.

Extent of publication 

62Publication of matter on social media forms part of publication of material of a highly attractive nature, available over the Internet, which is ""publication to the world at large"" (Higgins v Sinclair, supra, at [16]).

63Seven of the publications were made on the Internet, to an audience which would have been quick to think the worst when reading material of such a sensational nature. The timing of the entries, in circumstances where Mr Campion was about to give evidence at the Royal Commission in November 2013, was critical.

64Out of the remaining publications, all but the seventh matter complained of (which I propose to disregard for the purposes of damages, since it was effectively a publication to the second and third plaintiffs themselves) were made to persons with whom each of the plaintiffs had a professional relationship. Such publications are often described as hitting a plaintiff ""where he/she/it lives"", in the sense that such publications, although limited, are the more hurtful for being sent to persons with whom the plaintiff has a close relationship.

65All of the matters complained of convey imputations of dishonesty, incompetency and neglect. Of particular seriousness are the following imputations:

(a)Imputation (c) in the first matter complained of.

(b)Imputation (d) in the second matter complained of.

(c)Imputations (d) and (e) in the eighth matter complained of.

(d)Imputation (e) of the eleventh matter complained of.

(e)Imputation (b) of the twelfth matter complained of.

66While imputations of dishonesty, incompetence and neglect are serious issues, imputations of involvement in child abuse of any kind must be viewed as the most serious imputations capable of being made.

67Mr McCall referred to a number of recent decisions where defamation damages where awarded. In Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals New South Wales v Davies, supra, Latham J referred at [56] to the statement by Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, supra, that there was a limited utility in comparing awards for defamation. Her Honour went on to note awards in Higgins v Sinclair, supra, of $100,000 to each plaintiff for material published on a website and sent to an email involving allegations of negligence, dishonesty and theft. 

68I acknowledge what her Honour says about the comparative value of other damages awards, but more recently, in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2014] QCA 33, Applegarth J carefully reviews the relevant principles in relation to damages and (at [46]-[49]) carefully explains the proper use of comparable awards. That includes (at [83]) the position of the defamation of a corporation. I have found his Honour's comments a helpful guide in the correct approach to take to damages generally.

The defendant's submissions

69Although it is unusual to do so, I propose to consider the defendant's submissions first, before turning to the evidence of the plaintiffs.

70The defendant's principal submission, in relation to the first defendant, is that it is not an exempt corporation and cannot bring defamation proceedings. I reject that submission, as the plaintiff has demonstrated, by tender of the Memorandum of Association and the affidavit of its Chief Executive Officer, that it is a not for profit corporation falling within the provisions of s 9(2)(b) of the Act: see Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales v Davies, supra, at [2]-[5].

71His second submission is that the first plaintiff, if not a corporation, would be ""a convicted paedophile for all the sex and other abuse it has committed, admitted to, apologised for and paid some victims compensation for"" (Exhibit 1). He goes on to refer to current child abuse inquiries in the United Kingdom, and to claim that the first defendant is a ""thoroughly despicable organisation which should have been closed down in disgrace like the News of the World was closed when it was caught behaving badly"" (Exhibit 1).

72The circumstances of the closure of News of the World (shut down at its owner's behest, not by process of law) are irrelevant. The News of the World (surprisingly, perhaps) played no part, ""despicable"" or otherwise, in any of the historic child abuse claims, in children's homes or hospitals, or by clergy or other persons (such as celebrities), currently under investigation in the United Kingdom.

73The defendant employs the ""no smoke without fire"" approach to the issues in this case (to use Eady J's phrase in Lillie v Newcastle City Council [2002] EWHC 1600 at [361] - [366]). In the course of this judgment, when commenting on somewhat similar general allegations that child sex abuse must have occurred, Eady J rejected what he called a ""job lot"" of allegations of child abuse could be brought on the basis that it was possible some abuse had occurred at some stage. 

74In the present case, there is even less evidence, in that there is no link whatever between the corporate first plaintiff or the individual plaintiffs and the historic allegations forty or more years ago. The NSW Court of Appeal, in Westbus Pty Ltd (Receivers Appointed) v Ishak [2006] NSWCA 198 at [20], similarly warned about the use of ""conjecture"" to draw conclusions of this kind.

75Contrary to the defendant's claims that such allegations should be protected by ""freedom of speech"", generalised and unproved allegations are a nuisance to the current ongoing inquiries into historic abuse claims of the kind discussed in Mr Campion's Facebook account. In his Facebook comment of 5 December 2013 (Exhibit M), Mr Campion says that the defendant is just that - ""a nuisance"". The defendant's claims (paragraph 3 of his submissions) that he had sent ""many more"" messages to Mr Campion that were not published are a confirmation of Mr Campion's ultimate rejection (after having initially encouraged the defendant until deciding his contributions were not worth publishing) of the defendant's allegations. As for the defendant's (completely irrelevant) references to the importance of revelations such as his to the child abuse inquiries currently being held in the United Kingdom, similar concerns to those referred to by the plaintiffs, about the dangers of exaggerated and unresearched allegations of this nature, have no doubt concerned these investigating bodies and respected child research abuse sites (such as Spotlight). The defendant's submissions only reinforce the danger of the false allegation - so easy to make, and so difficult to refute.

76The defendant not only denies that he consented to publication of the Facebook entries he made but, as to the extent of publication in relation to damages, claims that he was not responsible for the circulation of emails to carers beyond the persons to whom they were addressed. I do not accept these submissions, in light of the evidence to the contrary set out above.

77Having set out the defendant's submissions, and my reasons for not accepting them, I now consider the evidence of the plaintiffs on issues of damages. This evidence was in the form of affidavits which have all been served on the defendant.

The first plaintiff

78In relation to an organisation working in the area of caring of disadvantaged children, imputations that the first plaintiff is dishonest, does not care for the children placed in its care, abuses those children and mistreats foster carers are imputations of great seriousness. The most serious are, as I have already indicated, allegations of abuse of children. Few crimes are more detested than the abuse (particularly sexual abuse) of young and vulnerable children, especially coming from the persons into whose care they have been put.

79Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that vindication can only be achieved by a significant award of damages, which he puts at $50,000. The submissions of the plaintiffs were served upon the defendant. He is therefore familiar with the figure of $50,000 and has responded to it in his submissions. 

80As is set out above, the defendant states that none of the plaintiffs should be entitled to any damages. This is an unrealistic submission and I am unimpressed by the defendant's claim that the plaintiff is a ""paedophile company"". I accept Mr McCall's submission that a substantial award is necessary for vindication purposes and accordingly I propose to award the sum of $50,000. As a corporation, the first plaintiff is not entitled to aggravated compensatory damages.

The second and third plaintiffs

81The second plaintiff holds qualifications in social sciences and foster caring. She commenced employment with the first plaintiff in 2012 after a career in the field of foster care. The imputations raised against her include that she was dishonest, involved in a scam, incompetent, unqualified, treats foster care providers badly and does not care about children under her care.

82The second plaintiff has suffered injury to health as a result of these publications and reacted badly to the twelfth matter complained of, locking herself away in distress and crying. I have read the affidavit of her mother, confirming this incident (affidavit of Ms Rodwell, Exhibit H, at paragraphs 10-13). She was distressed by the fourth to sixth and eighth matters complained of, because she was pregnant at the time, caring for her young daughter and doing so in circumstances where her husband was working away from home. She suffered anxiety and panic attacks and sought treatment from a psychologist. I have read the affidavit of her husband, her mother and Ms Teece setting out their observations of her deep distress, upset, sleeplessness and hurt to feelings generally.

83I am satisfied that the effect upon the second plaintiff was significant and that she suffered greatly as a result of the defendant's actions. The sum necessary to address the three elements of compensation must be significant.

84The second plaintiff also claims aggravated compensatory damages. In Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [37]-[40], Applegarth J explains:

""[37] Damages may be increased if there is ""a lack of bona fides in the defendant's conduct or it is improper or unjustifiable"". The aggravating conduct may have occurred in making the publication or at any time up to the assessment of damages. Aggravated damages are compensatory in nature:

""The concept of 'aggravated damages' is not, whether calculated separately or not, a different 'head' of damage. It focuses on the circumstances of the wrongdoing which have made the impact of it worse for the plaintiff. It is not to go beyond compensation for the aggravation of the harm to repute or feelings. It is not a means of punishing a defendant."" 

Section 37 of the Act states that a plaintiff cannot be awarded exemplary or punitive damages for defamation.

[38] Conduct which is improper, unjustifiable or lacks bona fides may affect reputation. In such a case the damage ""continues until it is caused to cease"" by an avowal by the defendant that the defamation is untrue or a judgment in the plaintiff's favour. Accordingly, damages may be increased by an unjustifiable failure to apologise or retract, by unjustifiable persistence in making untrue allegations or by the conduct of the defence of proceedings in a manner which is unjustifiable, improper or lacking in bona fides. The robust but reasonable pursuit of a bona fide defence where there is evidence to support it does not permit an award of aggravated damages. Pleading and persisting in a defence of truth without a proper basis does.

[39] Conduct which is improper, unjustifiable or lacks bona fides may increase injury to feelings by causing the plaintiff greater indignity. Bad conduct by the defendant may outrage the plaintiff's feelings. In Carson McHugh J stated, ""the anger of the plaintiff is placated only when he or she knows that the defendant has been punished for the wrong"". However, care is required that an award to compensate the plaintiff for injured feelings has ""an appropriate and rational relationship"" with the harm sustained and does not contain an impermissible punitive element which exceeds what is necessary to ""assuage the hurt, indignation and desire for retribution which the plaintiff feels"". 

[40] Section 36 of the Act requires the court in awarding damages to ""disregard the malice or other state of mind of the defendant at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter...or at any other time except to the extent that the malice or other state of mind affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff."" Thus malice or a reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of the publication does not warrant, of itself, an award of aggravated damages. However, if the plaintiff is aware of the defendant's state of mind and this aggravates the plaintiff's hurt feelings, then damages may be increased in order to appropriately compensate. If the defendant's conduct is improper or unjustifiable, this aggravation may be reflected in a separate award of aggravated damages.""

85Applegarth J goes on to explain the interaction of aggravated damages and general compensatory damages:

""[41] An award of damages in excess of the statutory cap is permitted if the circumstances of publication are such as to warrant an award of aggravated damages. But this does not compel a judge to separately assess aggravated damages. In 1997 this court remarked in the context of a jury's assessment of damages that there was no reason why the jury should have been obliged to answer a distinct question about aggravated damages. Circumstances of aggravation may justify ""the court in assessing compensatory damages at a figure higher than that which would have been appropriate without those circumstances; but this does not mean that the increase is a separate category of damages"". The court observed:

""The jury is not to be invited to perform the difficult intellectual task of first considering the defamation in an abstract way, disregarding the circumstances in which it was published and the extent of publication, and then separately considering how much should be awarded for those matters"".""

86The question remains whether aggravated damages should be awarded as a separate assessment or the damages award should be adjusted. I note Applegarth J's statement at [42] that a judge may assess a single amount which is appropriate to compensate for harm caused by the publication and the additional harm resulting from the conduct warranting the award of aggravated compensatory damages.

87Damages may be mitigated in a number of ways, some of which are set out at s 38(1) of the Act. There are no mitigating circumstances in these proceedings.

88Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that an appropriate sum, taking into account these principles, is $100,000. Again, that is a figure with which the defendant is familiar, and I have read his submissions in this regard. I propose to award this sum as the total of general and aggravated damages, in accordance with s 39 of the Act.

The third plaintiff

89The third plaintiff has been employed by the first plaintiff as its General Manager and Chief Executive Officer since August 2010. He is also a member of Anglicare Australia's Council, which is the governing body for Anglicare Australia.

90The imputations made against the third plaintiff are also extremely serious. They are essentially the same as those set out above for the second plaintiff.

91The impact upon the third plaintiff's health has been severe because he has a prior history of depression. As a result of the publication of the matters complained of he sought medical treatment (affidavit of Mr Yourell, paragraph 29). His wife has deposed that his response to the publication has included not only anxiety and depression but insomnia (at paragraphs 3-7).

92In particular, the defendant has expressly charged the third plaintiff with engaging in child abuse. For a man, that is a particularly serious imputation. The written submissions of the defendant inflame the situation by sneering at the third plaintiff's prior history of depression.

93Mr McCall submits, and I agree, that an appropriate award of damages, having regard to the relevant principles set out above, is $100,000. This would reflect the need for a substantial award and the factors warranting an award of aggravated compensatory damages. Again, it is the figure identified in the plaintiffs' submissions served on the defendant, and therefore an amount to which the defendant has had the opportunity to reply.

94I am aware of the dangers of awarding similar sums for plaintiffs in defamation proceedings (see Maxwell-Smith v Warren [2007] NSWCA 270). However, each of the plaintiffs has been careful to plead only imputations in which they are named, and the objections of the Court of Appeal to the awarding of similar sums in Maxwell-Smith v Warren, which appears to have been bound up in the issues of identification discussed in those proceedings as the plaintiffs were not named, would not apply here.

95As requested by counsel for the plaintiffs I have reserved the issues of interest and costs with liberty to apply.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the first plaintiff for $50,000.

(2)Judgment for the second plaintiff for $100,000.

(3)Judgment for the third plaintiff for $100,000.

(4)Costs and interest reserved with liberty to apply on 7 days' notice.

(5)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

The appellant, a Nigerian national, was tried before the High Court on a charge for importing into Singapore six packets of substance containing not less than 2,199g of diamorphine on 29 November 1990 at about 8am at Keppel Railway Station, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction this appeal was brought. We heard the appeal and, at the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution, so far as material, was this. On 29 November 1990, the appellant was on board the train from West Malaysia which arrived at Keppel Railway Station (`the railway station`) at about 7am. A team of three customs officers from the Investigation Branch of the Customs and Excise Department were carrying out surveillance duties in plain clothes at the station. The team comprised Chief Customs Officers R Tanahgobar (`CCO Tanahgobar`), Higher Customs Officer Abdul Aziz bin Hashim (`HCO Aziz`) and Higher Customs Officer Pius Michael (`HCO Michael`).
As the train came to a halt, CCO Tanahgobar saw the appellant behaving suspiciously at the exit of coach No 4. He informed HCO Michael to keep the appellant under surveillance. HCO Michael boarded the train to observe the appellant. He noticed the appellant walking back to coach No 4 and sitting on a bed. The appellant waited for all the other passengers to alight before he got off. He carried a black briefcase, a grey coloured plastic bag and a colourful bag with vertical stripes. He walked towards the immigration counter and joined the queue for foreigners. He did not talk to anyone when he was standing in the queue. Upon clearance at immigration, he walked to the customs counter. HCO Michael stopped him and asked for his passport. Both CCO Tanahgobar and HCO Aziz were also in attendance.
The appellant`s passport revealed that he was a Nigerian civil servant. HCO Michael sought confirmation from the appellant in English as to his profession and he replied `civil servant` in English. The appellant was then brought into the customs office where his luggage was searched. HCO Michael asked him if he had anything to declare and the appellant answered in the negative. Upon further questioning, the appellant stated that he came from Bangkok and would be staying two to three days in Singapore after which he would return to Bangkok for a month. He explained that the reason why he carried so much luggage for a short trip was because he intended to send them by special delivery. He replied that he did not have any cigarettes, liquors or drugs. HCO Michael then opened the appellant`s luggage. The black briefcase revealed clothings, coins, a Bible and a Book of Psalms. The grey plastic bag was then searched but only stainless steel items were found. After that, HCO Michael turned his attention to the colourful bag with the verticle stripes. In it were the following: a Kando light weight iron, a National electric pot and frying pan, a Sharp rice cooker and a Zojirushi rice cooker. He then examined the base of the Zojirushi rice cooker and noticed that one of the screws had been tampered with. CCO Tanahgobar was informed of this discovery. HCO Michael took a screw driver from CCO Tanahgobar and was about to unscrew the base of the rice cooker when the appellant said that he felt like vomiting and tried to leave the room. He was stopped by CCO Tanahgobar from doing so. The appellant was given a plastic bag by CCO Tanahgobar to vomit into but the appellant only spat into it. HCO Michael asked the appellant if the rice cooker was new. The appellant answered in the affirmative and added that he had purchased it in Thailand. When the base of the rice cooker was removed, there was some asbestos lining, and when the lining was removed, there was a blue plastic bag containing a white powdery substance. HCO Michael pointed to the plastic bag and asked him twice what it was. The appellant remained silent. CCO Tanahgobar then checked the Sharp rice cooker and also noticed that the screws at the base had been tampered with. When the base was removed, a white plastic bag containing a white powdery substance was retrieved. When he was asked what it was, the appellant initially remained silent but then uttered `Hallelujah!` twice as well as words which nobody understood. He then said twice: `You can kill me!`.
A body search of the appellant revealed nothing incriminating. HCO Michael then asked him in English where the appellant would be staying in Singapore. The appellant mentioned his Canadian girlfriend`s place but he could not remember where that was and added that, even if he did, the Customs Officers would not let him go there.
HCO Michael, CCO Tanahgobar and HCO Aziz stated that after the conversation had taken place, they recorded the contents of it on a piece of paper which was later transcribed into their pocket diaries. They were, however, unable to produce the pocket diaries in court.
At about 9.20am the investigating officer of the case, Insp Lee Kiong Lock (`Insp Lee`) arrived and was briefed by CCO Tanahgobar. He recovered the two packets of powder from the customs officers as well as the rest of the items contained in the grey plastic bag and the colourful bag. Insp Lee also searched the appellant and seized from him the following:
 
 
(i) a KLM air ticket from Bangkok containing a ticket to Lagos via Amsterdam issued in the appellant`s name; 
 
(ii) US$985, and 
 
(iii) $289 of Thai Baht.
  
 
 
Dr Saw Chwee Guan, a scientific officer from the department of scientific services (`DSS`), analyzed the two packets of white powdery substance and certified that they contained not less than 2,199g of diamorphine.
 The defence
The appellant gave evidence in his defence and his evidence, so far as material, was this. He is a Nigerian and grew up in Onishta, Nigeria. His educational qualifications were minimal. He attended classes only up to nursery school after which he gave up his studies. He was illiterate and could speak only Igbo. At the age of 20, he left his village for Lagos and assisted in selling groceries for 31/2 years. After that he worked for another 31/2 years until 1990 in a company which cleaned government offices. At the time of the arrest, he was 34 years old.
Prior to his arrest, he was carrying on a business in Nigeria of dealing in cameras, photographic materials and accessories as a sole proprietor. He started this business whilst he was working in the civil service. As a civil servant he was employed by a company called GMO as a messenger.
He went to Bangkok in September 1990 to purchase photographic materials, cameras and chemicals. In Bangkok, he met two Nigerians, Okke and Uchenna, who were also in the photographic line of business in Nigeria. Okke and Uchenna helped him make all the purchases as he could not communicate with anyone else in Bangkok because of the language problem. He spent US$38,000 in Bangkok in making the purchases for his business. He could not get a Mamiya camera which many of his customers in Nigeria wanted. He wanted to purchase at least one Mamiya camera to show his customers and to establish contact so that he could order more in future. His attempts to procure this camera in Bangkok failed. He then met one Obiara, a fellow Nigerian, who dealt in electronics and Obiara promised to take him to Singapore as the latter knew where to buy Mamiya cameras. He flew to Singapore with Obiara and spent two days and one night. It was Obiara who filled up his disembarkation form for the Singapore immigration. They went to many places in Singapore but could not get a Mamiya camera. He then accompanied Obiara back to Bangkok.
Within a week of his return from Singapore, he met another Nigerian called Anthony Mbaekwa (`Anthony`). Anthony`s younger brother, Jude, was his close friend. Anthony traded in cooking utensils such as gas and rice cookers. He respected Anthony as the latter was older and a successful businessman. The appellant claimed that he respected Anthony so much to the extent that he would not even speak face to face with him. The appellant informed Anthony about his search for a Mamiya camera. Anthony offered to help as he knew where it could be purchased in Singapore. Anthony asked him to go to Singapore. The appellant informed Anthony that he would be going by train and would meet Anthony in Singapore. Anthony wrote a telephone number at the back of a card where he could be contacted. Anthony then informed him that he wanted the accused to carry samples of goods for him to Singapore: they were rice cookers and things he had bought in Singapore or Bangkok.
On 28 November 1990, Anthony met him at the Bangkok railway station. The appellant described his meeting with Anthony as `brief and snappy` in which Anthony passed him a grey plastic bag and a colourful bag with vertical stripes. The appellant opened both the bags and saw that they contained boxes and kitchen utensils. After that he did not examine the bags or question Anthony further as to the contents of the boxes.
Whilst on the train, the appellant met an African of Liberian nationality. The appellant asked him in a mixture of Igbo and broken English to assist him in filling up his disembarkation form which the latter did. Upon his arrival in Singapore, the Liberian got off the train and spoke to him while they were on the railway platform. The Liberian advised him that should he have any problem in Singapore he should show his passport to any person and they would help him. The appellant was instructed to follow behind him when he walked to the immigration counter. In the immigration queue, the Liberian was standing ahead of him with a white man separating them.
When the appellant was stopped by customs officers who questioned him, he could not understand them. He tried to speak broken English to them and denied saying that he told them that he was a civil servant. The appellant denied answering the questions posed by the customs officers as well as all the utterances attributed to him by the customs officers. He claimed that when the rice cookers were removed from the box it was the first time he had seen a rice cooker. He had never seen, nor had he handled, a rice cooker before as he used firewood and a metal pot back home. He then stated that when the rice cookers were searched and drugs were found, he said in broken English that those thing did not belong to him and shouted `hey, wo` (meaning `Oh, my God`) several times which the customs officers might have mistaken for `Hallelujah`. Although he denied saying the words `You can kill me!` he remembered saying in his own Igbo that Anthony had killed him.
Also significant was the discovery of a copy of the Bible and a copy of the Book of Psalms in English found in his black briefcase. The appellant admitted to the ownership of these books and said that he kept them under his pillow each night and they were his constant travelling companions. He claimed that he had the Igbo version of the B
ible but he stated that he did not read that version. The books were meant to strengthen his faith by having them around him.
Lastly, the appellant tendered a letter dated 27 February 1992 from his wife Veronica in Nigeria which was a reply to a letter he had written while he was in remand prison. The appellant had requested his wife to look for Anthony. Her reply was admitted as exhibit D-1 to show the fact that it was made and not for the truth of its contents. It was also admitted to show the fact that the appellant`s wife was unable to locate Anthony.
 Trial judge`s findings
The trial judge accepted the evidence of the three customs officers who gave evidence against the appellant and found that the evidence of the customs officers showed that the appellant knew that the rice cookers contained drugs. The trial judge rejected the appellant`s claim that he could not speak English. He found the appellant guilty of the charge.
 Appeal
Before us, counsel for the appellant raised three main arguments. First, as a preliminary point, he argued that the trial judge had already delivered an oral judgment on 20 September 1993 and erred in law in writing his grounds of decision on 20 December 1993. He submitted that the grounds of decision therefore ought to be disregarded and the court ought to have regard only to the reasons given in the oral judgment. Counsel relied on 
 Ankur Nath Ganguli v PP 
, 
 Lorraine Phyllis Cohen & Anor v PP 
 and s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Similar argument as this has been canvassed before us very recently in 
 Goh Lai Wak v PP 
, and, in disposing of such argument, this court said: 
 
We agree with the propositions enunciated in 
 Ankur Nath
 and 
 Lorraine Phylis Cohen
. A judge cannot subsequently give his grounds of decision if he has already delivered a prior judgment at the conclusion of the trial which contains his reasons for convicting the accused. This principle does not affect the operation of s 218 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides that a judgment shall be explained to the accused. There cannot be any objection to a judge providing briefly at the conclusion of a trial an outline of the issues before him and the evidence on them, and to indicate briefly, without reasons, his findings on them. In such circumstances, there should be no objection if subsequent written grounds of decision are delivered in which the evidence is fully reviewed and the judge`s detailed reasons or grounds of his findings are comprehensively recorded.
 
 
 
That precisely was what had happened in the instant case. In the oral judgment the trial judge stated the charge, the prosecution case, the defence and his findings that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, that he had no doubt that the appellant knew that diamorphine was concealed in the rice cookers, and that, accordingly, the appellant was guilty of the charge. Following what we have said in 
 Goh Lai Wak 
, we could see no objection to the trial judge in this case providing, subsequent to his oral judgment, his written grounds of decision. In our judgment, these grounds of decision could certainly form part of the record for consideration by this court.
The next argument advanced by counsel was that the appellant did not import the drugs into Singapore. His arguments ran along the following line. The appellant was arrested at the premises of the Malayan Railway Station at Keppel Road, and the premises there are owned and have been owned by the Government of Malaysia since 23 March 1949. Under s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) `Singapore` is defined as the Republic of Singapore and includes the Island of Singapore and all islands and places which on 2 June 1959 were administered as part of Singapore and all territorial waters adjacent thereto. Clause 9 of the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 was also referred to by counsel and that clause reads as follows: 
 
All property, movable and immovable, and rights, liabilities and obligations which before Malaysia Day belonged to or were the responsibility of the Government of Singapore and which on that day or after became the property or the responsibility of the Government of Malaysia shall on Singapore day revert to and vest in or devolve upon and become once again the property of or the responsibility of Singapore.
 
 
 
He also relied on two Singapore statutes, namely, the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act (Cap 316) and the Service Lands Act (Cap 292). These Acts, he submitted, gave the Malaysian government territorial jurisdiction for the purposes stated in those Acts. Turning to the ownership of the Malayan Railway (which includes the Keppel Railway Station and the railway line from the causeway to the station) by the Malaysian government, he submitted that that ownership bestowed upon Malaysia criminal jurisdiction over offences committed therein. As the Keppel Railway Station and the Singapore railway line (from the causeway to the station) were owned by the Government of Malaysia, they were under the territorial jurisdiction of Malaysia. In consequence, the appellant could only be prosecuted in Malaysia for an offence of importation of drugs into Malaysia from Thailand or, alternatively, for export of drugs from Malaysia.
This argument was wholly untenable and we had no hesitation in rejecting it. We took judicial notice of the territorial boundaries of Singapore, and the official map of Singapore clearly shows the northern boundary between Singapore and Malaysia as situate along the Straits of Johor, and all that part of the railway line south of the boundary is part of Singapore territory. So are the premises of Keppel Railway Station at Keppel Road. The stretch of land on which the railway line runs and the station premises are owned by the Malaysian government for purely commercial purpose and such ownership per se does not establish Malaysian sovereignty over the property in Singapore. Both the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act and the Service Lands Act are of very limited application: the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act deals with the setting up of customs stations in Singapore to collect duties for Malaysia, while the Service Lands Act deals with the ejectment of trespassers from Malaysian military lands in Singapore. These Acts do not expressly or by implication confer upon the Malaysian government any extra-territorial jurisdiction or criminal jurisdiction over that part of the railway line situate in Singapore or the Keppel Station.
The third main argument of counsel for the appellant was directed to the findings of fact made by the trial judge. Counsel criticized the trial judge`s acceptance of the evidence of the three customs officers, CCO Tanahgobar, HCO Aziz and HCO Michael, and pointed out the various inconsistencies in their evidence which, he submitted, the trial judge had failed to consider. Whatever may be the inconsistencies in their evidence, the basic primary facts established by their evidence which could not be challenged and had not been challenged were these. The appellant came to Singapore by train on the morning of 29 November 1990. As the train pulled up at the station, he was seen by the customs officers and kept under surveillance. He alighted from the train after all the other passengers had got off. He was then carrying a black briefcase, a plastic bag and a colourful bag with verticle stripes. At the customs counter, he was stopped and later was brought to the customs office. There, his bags were searched and packets of powdery substance were found concealed in the false bottoms of the two rice cookers and the substance on analysis was found to contain not less than 2,199g of diamorphine. These facts were beyond dispute. On these facts, the presumptions (i) that the appellant was in possession of the drugs and (ii) that he knew the nature of the drugs arose under s 18 of the Act. It is for the appellant to rebut these presumptions.
The appellant gave evidence before the trial judge seeking to rebut the presumptions. The trial judge saw and heard him, and found that the appellant was not truthful and he disbelieved the appellant. On the evidence before him, the trial judge was amply justified in reaching this finding. On the basis of such finding, it was plain to us that the trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumptions. We too reached the same finding.
It is true that the trial judge had gone further in his findings. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the customs officers as to what took place at the customs office when the appellant`s bags were searched and the concealed drugs were discovered. He found them as witnesses of truth and that they did not concoct a story of what took place. On the basis of this and other evidence before him, he also found that the appellant knew that the two rice cookers contained the drugs. Here again, the trial judge was justified in reaching such a conclusion and there was no material error in his findings which would warrant our interference with such findings.
The appeal had no merit and was accordingly dismissed.
 Appeal dismissed.",1994-03-17 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal
4915,2701988,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 27) [2016] NSWSC 152,"Judgment EX-TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Today marks the commencement of week five of this trial. Following commencement of proceedings this morning, and in accordance with my customary practice, I made periodic observations of the members of the jury as evidence was being given. In the course of doing so, I observed that one of the members of the jury, a male who was then seated adjacent to the foreperson, appeared to be closing his eyes and falling asleep on a regular basis.
	
	
	I proceeded to pay particular attention to that member of the jury as the evidence led up to the morning tea adjournment. It was evident to me from those observations that he was struggling to stay awake, and was clearly asleep for broken periods over that time.
	
	
	During the course of the morning tea adjournment, I spoke with the Crown and counsel for each of the accused in chambers, at which time I appraised them of my observations. I invited each of them to undertake their own observations when proceedings resumed after morning tea and indicated that I would do the same.
	
	
	When I did so, the pattern of the juror’s behaviour was much the same as it had been earlier that morning. There were numerous periods in which the juror was clearly asleep. When an adjournment was taken shortly before lunch the Crown indicated that he (understandably) had not had the opportunity to make any sustained observations but did say that he had briefly noticed the juror apparently closing his eyes.
	
	
	Ms Shead, who appears for the accused McNamara indicated to me that following the morning tea adjournment she had made her own observations of the juror in question. Those observations, to use her words, were that the juror had his “eyes closed and head down”. Ms Shead also said this was not the first occasion in which she, and those who instruct her, had noted this to be the case. She cited an instance a couple of weeks ago where a similar situation had arisen, albeit though one that was brief compared to what had occurred this morning.
	
	
	Mr Thomas of counsel who appears for the accused Rogerson indicated he had noted last week that the juror ""appeared to have his eyes closed for a short period"". He raised the question of whether or not it would be appropriate for me, in the absence of counsel, to make a specific inquiry of the juror to ascertain, amongst other things, whether or not he might be suffering from some medical condition that served to explain what had occurred. As to that suggested course I observed at the time, and I observe again, that even if the juror in question is suffering from some medical condition, it does not alter the fact that he has been asleep for periods during this trial, not only today but before today, and as such could not possibly have been paying attention to the evidence.
	
	
	I then gave all parties an opportunity to consider their respective positions and, in the case of counsel for each of the accused, an opportunity to obtain instructions. Upon resumption this afternoon Ms Shead has made an application that the juror be discharged. Mr Thomas made no formal application and did not seek to add to the submissions that he had made to me earlier today. The Crown did not make a formal application but at the same time made it clear that, accepting the accuracy of the observations that I have summarised, it seemed not only appropriate but mandatory that the juror be discharged.
	
	
	The Jury Act 1977 (NSW) (the “Act”) contains two particular provisions which govern the power of the Court to make an order discharging an individual juror. Section 53A makes provision for the mandatory discharge of an individual juror and is in the following terms:
	


53A Mandatory discharge of individual juror

(1) The court or coroner must discharge a juror if, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest:

(a) it is found that the juror was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was excluded from jury service or was otherwise not returned and selected in accordance with this Act, or

(b) the juror has become excluded from jury service, or

(c) the juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial or coronial inquest.

(2) In this section:

""misconduct"" , in relation to a trial or coronial inquest, means:

(a) conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act, or

Note : For example, under section 68C it is an offence for a juror to make certain inquiries except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

(b) any other conduct that, in the opinion of the court or coroner, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial or inquest.


	
	Section 53B of the Act confers an additional, and wide, discretion on the Court to discharge an individual juror in particular defined circumstances, as follows:
	


53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(a) the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or

(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

Note : Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.


	
	The definition of the word ""misconduct"" as it appears in s. 53A of the Act is a wide one. In particular, s. 53A(2)(b) makes it clear that misconduct includes any conduct falling short of conduct constituting an offence which, in the opinion of the Court, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The inability of a member of a jury to stay awake and listen to the evidence as it is being given, and the propensity of that inability to give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, needs no further comment.
	
	
	Fundamental to the right of an accused person, and indeed the Crown, to a fair trial, is the proposition that all members of the jury should be alert, attentive, and in a position to follow and comprehend the evidence as it is being given. It is impossible for a juror to discharge that function if he or she is asleep. Any further observation in relation to that would be superfluous.
	
	
	I should also emphasise that my observations of the juror are specifically consistent with those of Ms Shead, and generally consistent with those of Mr Thomas and the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is not necessary for me to consider the provisions of s. 53B of the Act although I should say that had I been required to do so I would have come to the view that the member of the jury was not able to perform his functions and should not continue to act as a juror.
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose to make an order discharging the juror in question. I will have the juror come into court by himself, at which time I will explain to him, in brief terms, why I have taken the course that I have. I will then ask the officer to ensure that he is taken from the court, following which we will resume with the remaining 13 jurors. It is appropriate that the remaining 13 jurors be informed, again in general terms, of why this course has been taken. In explaining that, I propose to take the opportunity to remind the members of the jury of the necessity to listen carefully at all times to the evidence as it is given.
	
	
	For those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s. 53A of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), juror number 01453654 from call number 650-8 is discharged.
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 53C(1)(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) the trial is to continue with a reduced number of jurors, namely 13 jurors.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 2007/15155 DC 2007/11/0697 GILES JA R S HULME J LATHAM J THURSDAY 4 MARCH 2010 
     
     Tony PULITANO v R 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GILES JA: In 1999 the applicant was committed for trial on charges arising from events on 1 December 1998, in which he drove a stolen car at police who were attempting to detain it and its occupants. He was in custody from his arrest on 16 December 1998 until granted bail on 7 April 1999.  
     
      
    2 The applicant absconded prior to trial. In 2007 he voluntarily handed himself in to the police. He thereafter pleaded guilty to three charges arising from the events of 1 December 1998, although perhaps not precisely those on which he had been committed for trial. They were driving a stolen car; assaulting police officers with intent to prevent the apprehension of himself and two other persons; and resisting police officers in executing their duty. 
     
      
    3 On 2 May 2008 Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months for each of the offences, implicitly as concurrent sentences, but suspended the sentences on condition of entry into a good behaviour bond for eighteen months. His Honour did not specify non-parole periods.  
     
      
    4 Thereafter the applicant breached the conditions of the bond, in that he failed to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and failed to notify that Service of his change of address. He was taken into custody on 27 July 2009, and in due course came before Berman DCJ.  
     
      
    5 On 9 October 2009 Berman DCJ revoked the order suspending the sentences. It may be that the correct order should have been revocation of the bonds, with the order suspending their sentences then ceasing to have effect pursuant to s 99(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but no point is taken as to the formulation of the order. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is sentenced therefore to imprisonment for eighteen months. The non-parole period is nine months. It will have commenced on 27 July 2009 and will thus expire on 26 April 2010...” 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence, on the ground that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the pre-sentence custody in December 1988 - April 1999. He does not challenge the revocation of the order suspending the sentences. To the extent that an extension of time is required to apply for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on 2 May 2008, it should be granted. The error on which the applicant relies is said to be either failure at the time the sentence was imposed on 2 May 2008, or failure at the time the suspension of the sentence ceased to have effect on 9 October 2009.  
     
      
    7 In sentencing an offender the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence, (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (s 24(a)). It was accepted that the pre-sentence custody in the present case was solely referable to the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. A court may direct that a sentence be taken to have commenced on a day before that on which it is imposed (s 47(2)(a)), with a specific requirement that in deciding the day pre-sentence custody be taken into account (s 47(3)).  
     
      
    8 The statutory mandate can be fulfilled by backdating the date on which the sentence is to commence, as provided for in s 47(2)(a), or by reducing the sentence imposed. The former course is generally to be preferred, see R v McHugh [1985] 1 NSWLR 588; R v Deeble (CCA, 19 December 1991, unreported); and R v Newman and Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, (2004) 145 ACrimR 361 particularly at [22]-[23]. The latter course can be followed for good reason, see R v Deeble and R v Leete [2001] NSWCCA 337, (2001) 25 ACrimR 37. 
     
      
    9 However, the former course, that is, backdating at the time of sentence, is not available when a sentence is suspended pursuant to s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and by s 12(3) Part 4 of the Act (within which is s 47, which would otherwise dictate a day of commencement of the sentence and allow for backdating) does not apply to a sentence the subject of an order suspending its execution. Thus any pre-sentence custody must either be taken into account by reducing the sentence imposed, in which I include in prescribing the manner in which the sentence is to be served, or by backdating at the time there is revocation of the bond and the sentence descends.  
     
      
    10 It is not necessary to enter into which is the preferable course to adopt. The question for us is whether the first of these courses was in fact adopted by the judge when he sentenced on 2 May 2008. If he did, it is accepted by the applicant that there was no error in failing to backdate on 9 October 2009. Conversely, albeit perhaps with a qualification, it was accepted by the Crown that if he did not there should have been a backdating on 9 October 2009.  
     
      
    11 The remarks on sentence on 2 May 2008 included, in his Honour’s account of the circumstances, that the applicant had been arrested on 16 December 1998 and “spent about four months in custody before he was granted bail.” The pre-sentence custody was not otherwise mentioned.  
     
      
    12 The remarks on sentence included -  
     
      
       
        
        “The offences were serious and require a sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. But in the light of the favourable features mentioned in the pre-sentence report prepared by the Victorian authorities, and in light of the fact that I consider that a sentence of less than two years is called for, I propose to suspend the sentence. I consider this is a satisfactory way of dealing with this matter. It properly reflects the rehabilitative efforts that the offender has made. It recognises the seriousness of his conduct and it also enables me to impose upon Mr Pulitano the sentence he should have got had he been dealt with in 1999 in this court, in the event that he fails to comply with conditions of his bond. Mr Pulitano should be under no misapprehensions as to what is likely to happen should he commit a further offence. He will go to gaol. I will be the one who puts him in gaol if he commits any breach of the good behaviour bond which I will shortly announce.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour pronounced the sentences of eighteen months and their suspension. In addressing the applicant at the close of his remarks, his Honour said -  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pulitano if you’d been dealt with in 1998 or 1999 you would have gone to gaol. You are not going to gaol because of the good efforts you’ve made to rehabilitate yourself since 2001. But if you commit any offence in the next 18 months or y ou breach the good behaviour bond in any way in the next 18 months, you will be going to gaol for 18 months. You will get the sentence you should have got in 1998, do you understand? 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour was conscious of the pre-sentence custody and is unlikely, given the brief sentencing hearing and the fact that he was making his remarks on sentence immediately thereafter, to have forgotten about it. It is tolerably clear, in my opinion, that he meant that the sentences of imprisonment for eighteen months would be served in full, without any backdating by reason of the pre-sentence custody, in the event of breach of the conditions of the bond. He was emphatic that the applicant would go to gaol for eighteen months. That cannot stand with going to gaol, in context meaning going to gaol in the future in the event of breaching the bond, for about fourteen months because at the later time credit would be given for pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    15 Albeit not explicitly, in my opinion his Honour did take the pre-sentence custody into account in arriving at the sentences of eighteen months. 
     
      
    16 The Crown submitted more widely that his Honour had taken the pre-sentence custody into account in determining the type of sentence, here the leniency of a suspended sentence. The Crown referred in particular to Whyte v The Crown [2009] NSWCCA 18, in which R A Hulme J, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed, said of a submission that the sentencing judge had not taken pre-sentence custody into account when arriving at the term of a suspended sentence - 
     
      
       
        
        “17. The conclusion is inescapable, it seems to me, that the issue of pre-sentence custody was very clearly in her Honour’s mind and she gave the applicant credit for it by acceding to the submission that had been made by counsel on his behalf. Counsel invited her Honour to give effect to the pre-sentence custody by imposing a sentence of less than two years duration and by suspending it. This is precisely what her Honour did.” 
        
       
      
    17 In the present case it is not so clear that the judge was urged to have regard to the pre-sentence custody in imposing a suspended sentence. Of more significance, the remarks on sentence are against this wider submission. His Honour stated two matters in the light of which he proposed to suspend the sentence, namely, the favourable features mentioned in the pre-sentence report and his view that a sentence of less than two years was called for. There was at this point no reference to the pre-sentence custody, and I do not think it can be read into the reasons for suspending the sentence.  
     
      
    18 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons I have given it seems to me that the pre-sentence custody was taken into account in arriving at the sentences of eighteen months.  
     
      
    19 The applicant drew attention to the fact that the sentences of eighteen months were expressed in whole months, whereas the pre-sentence custody was a period of three months and twenty days. He submitted that it was unlikely that the judge had reasoned by first arriving at terms of twenty-one months and twenty-two days and then allowing for the pre-sentence custody in order to reach the eighteen months. Reference was made to R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 at [24], where there was noted a submission that a sentence expressed in round terms did not demonstrate the allowance of two periods of pre-sentence custody, although it is not clear that that submission was accepted. 
     
      
    20 The Crown drew attention to Starmer v R [2008] NSWCCA 27, where it was said at [13], (Grove J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing), that sentencing is not arithmetic and there is no need to sentence only in round figures. Equivalent to that observation, it was not necessary for his Honour to reason in precise figures in arriving at the eighteen months. It was open to his Honour to allow in a more global way for the three months and twenty-two days in coming to the period of eighteen months as the appropriate term for the suspended sentences. This was a valid argument in favour of the applicant, but in my opinion it is not one which outweighs the reasons I have given for my conclusion. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion, therefore, error has not been shown, and it is not necessary further to consider how account might properly be taken of pre-sentence custody in circumstances such as the present. There was no error on 9 October 2009 in failing to backdate by reason of the pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    22 I therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    23 R S HULME J: I agree. 
     
      
    24 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    25 GILES JA: That will be the order of the Court.

     1    SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Sperling J. I agree with the orders proposed, and generally, with his Honour’s reasons. I would merely add this, in order to make explicit the nature of the error in sentencing as I perceive it. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The sentencing judge referred to R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, and then said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In all of the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind that the Crown case was a very strong one and that the plea of guilty has, I find as a fact, little utilitarian value I quantify the value of the plea of guilty at 10 percent.” 
          
         
        
       
     3    In my opinion the correct interpretation of this passage is that the sentencing judge considered that the strength of the Crown case bore upon the utilitarian value of the plea. That runs counter to an express conclusion stated in Thomson and Houlton. At para 137 Spigelman CJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ agreed, wrote:

          [(1992) 58 A Crim R 345], Hunt CJ at CL related the strength of the Crown case only to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused (c/f  
          R v Beavan  
          [unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 22 August 1991]. As his Honour put it (at 350): 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘…the extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable.’ 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          In my opinion his Honour was correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A ‘recognition of the inevitable’ may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea.” 
          
         
        
       
     4    The last sentence makes it clear that the sentencing judge should not have approached the question of the quantification of the discount for the plea of guilty on the basis that its utilitarian value was diminished by reason of the strength of the Crown case. The strength of the Crown case was available to aid the evaluation of the applicant’s asserted contrition. 
      
       
        
       
     5    The applicant was entitled to the maximum benefit of the allowable reduction in sentence attributable to the timing of the entry of the plea; but, by reason of the length of a trial, had it taken place (two or three days) the allowance for that aspect of the utilitarian value of the plea was minimal. However, as promulgated in Thomson and Houlton, the minimum allowance to which an offender would ordinarily expect to receive is 10 percent on the sentence nominated as the starting point. I agree with Sperling J that, by reason of the timing of the applicant’s plea alone, he could legitimately have expected something in excess of that. However, as I have said, the estimated length of a trial meant he could not legitimately have expected that his sentence would be reduced by the 25 percent nominated as the upper end of the range in Thomson and Houlton. In my opinion the appropriate reduction in these circumstances was of the order of 15 percent. 
      
       
        
       
     6    Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Sperling J. 
      
       
        
       
     7    SPERLING J: On 12 February 1999, the applicant turned 18. Over the previous two years, he committed eight robberies in company and other serious property offences. He committed his first serious property crime when he was 15. Mostly, he targeted banks. 
      
       
        
       
     8    Having turned 18, the same pattern of behaviour continued. In February 2000, the applicant was convicted of being on enclosed lands without lawful excuse. In April 2000, he was convicted of stealing. For that last offence, he was placed under a community service order. He defaulted.  
      
       
        
       
     9    On 14 June 2000, the applicant was by then 19 years of age. The community service order was still current. With two companions, he entered the premises of State Government Employees’ Credit Union at Westmead Hospital. He leapt over the counter and demanded money. He and his companions ransacked the premises. In the noise and confusion that followed, the applicant stood over a female employee, terrorising her to such an extent that she became hysterical. Hospital staff intervened, putting their own safety at risk. The offenders fled. The applicant was caught. The offenders had got away with only $4 but that is of little moment. It belies the objective. This was no trifling episode. 
      
       
        
       
     10    The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and 10 months. But for a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would have been something over four years. The sentencing judge found special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period of three years. 
      
       
        
       
     11    One of the grounds on which the sentence is impugned is that inadequate allowance was made for an early plea of guilty. The applicant maintained his right to silence when apprehended. He pleaded guilty before he would have been committed for trial in the ordinary course. Whether the public expense of preparing a Crown brief had then been incurred or not at that stage is not clear. The case should, however, be classified as involving an early plea of guilty.  
      
       
        
       
     12    The trial would not have been long, perhaps two or three days. But the cost of that trial was avoided. The trial judge allowed a 10 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     13    In Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ said at [152] - [154]: 
      
       
        
         
          
          “In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 per cent. 
          
         
         
          
          The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
          
         
         
          
          There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
          
         
         
          
          (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea.” 
          
         
        
       
     14    In the present case, the plea was early, although the prospective trial was short. An allowance at the very bottom of the range was erroneous in these circumstances. 
      
       
        
       
     15    This point alone vitiates the sentencing process. The sentence should be set aside and this Court should resentence the applicant.  
      
       
        
       
     16    I did not consider, at the time of writing, that there was a need, in these circumstances, for me to consider other grounds on which the sentence was impugned. However, I have since read Simpson J’s proposed judgment. I agree that the appeal should also be allowed on the ground that the sentencing judge misdirected himself concerning the relevance of the strength of the Crown case for the reasons given by Simpson J in that regard. 
      
       
        
       
     17    As to resentencing, in Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, this Court promulgated a guideline range of sentences for armed robbery of four to five years. The applicability of the guideline range was made subject to certain conditions. Robbery in company carries the same maximum penalty as armed robbery. It is a comparable offence.  
      
       
        
       
     18    The conditions in Henry, set out at [162], included that the offender was young, little or no criminal history, and a late plea of guilty (the latter as explained in Thomson and Houlton at [161]). Thus, Henry contemplated a discount for an early plea on a sentence otherwise fixed under the guidelines promulgated in that case. 
      
       
        
       
     19    The condition relating to little or no criminal history is not satisfied in the present case. On the other hand, a discount for the utilitarian value of an early plea has to be made. 
      
       
        
       
     20    Deterring others is an important factor in sentencing. That consideration is given less weight in the case of young offenders. However, the importance of deterring others does not cease to be a factor altogether when sentencing young offenders. It continues to be a significant factor where the offence is grave and where there is a history of offending, as in the present case. These principles are well recognised. They apply in every case involving a young offender. The authorities need not be cited here. 
      
       
        
       
     21    In the present case, the applicant’s criminal history is so grave that I would give little weight to his youth as a mitigating factor.  
      
       
        
       
     22    Evidence was given at the sentencing hearing by Ms Elizabeth Kusch, psychologist. His Honour accepted her evidence. This Court should do likewise. She recorded that the applicant used heroin from the age of 15 or so. He had been raised in a dysfunctional family. He had suffered damaging experiences throughout his formative years which had impeded healthy personality development. He was of average intelligence. Notwithstanding that heroin addiction was likely to have been a contributing factor in the offence for which he was convicted, the applicant denied that he had any drug problem.  
      
       
        
       
     23    Unfortunately, this is a familiar profile in a prisoner with a history of serious property crimes: personality deficits, drug addiction, raising the money for drugs by criminal behaviour and little insight into the process. There is nothing in Ms Kusch’s report which makes the applicant a special case.  
      
       
        
       
     24    I would make no allowance for contrition. The applicant’s mother gave evidence. She said that the applicant had told her that he was sorry for what he did. He was crying and she believed him. She said she asked him if he was really going to change, and he said, “Yes”. The family is Fijian. She asked him if he would like to go to Fiji when he came out of gaol. He said he would, that he would love to get away from his friends and that he wanted to be changed.  
      
       
        
       
     25    It does not appear that the sentencing judge gave any weight to this evidence. Nor would I. In cross examination of Ms Lo, it became clear that the applicant did not inform his mother of anything like the true extent of his criminal history. Nor did the applicant give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Ms Kusch’s evidence indicated that the applicant had no insight into his own behaviour.  
      
       
        
       
     26    Evidence tendered on the appeal shows that the applicant has co-operated well with the prison authorities. He has worked conscientiously. He has applied for entry into the Violence Prevention Program and to see a welfare officer. There has been no adverse report. This conduct is commendable but it falls short of evidence that the applicant is contrite. 
      
       
        
       
     27    I would attribute no such motivation to the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is sufficient explanation for that. The early plea has a utilitarian value but that is all. 
      
       
        
       
     28    In re-sentencing the applicant I would begin with a head sentence of six years imprisonment. This includes some allowance for the applicant’s youth. I would reduce that by approximately 15 percent to five years for the early plea.  
      
       
        
       
     29    The non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the sentence, absent special circumstances. That would, provisionally, be a minimum non-parole period of three years and nine months. 
      
       
        
       
     30    The sentencing judge found special circumstances, particularly because of the need for an extensive period of supervised rehabilitation on the applicant’s release from prison. I agree with that approach and would also find special circumstances for that reason. I would not, however, reduce the non-parole period to the same extent as was done by the sentencing judge.  
      
       
        
       
     31    The applicant has been in custody since 14 June 2000.  
      
       
        
       
     32    I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        (2) Appeal allowed. 
         
         
        (3) Sentence quashed. 
         
         
        (4) In lieu thereof, applicant sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 14 June 2000. 
         
         
        (5) A non-parole period of three years commencing on 14 June 2000, and expiring on 13 June 2003, that being the earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole.

5840,2707434,"R v MEYN, John Michael (No 3) [2012] NSWSC 1467","EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Objection is taken by Mr Chapple of senior counsel for the accused to the tender of six photographs numbered 24, 25, 31, 36, 37 and 39, in a bundle of photographs which it is anticipated will be tendered through Detective Flippence.  For the sake of convenience, the bundle was exhibit B in the previous trial. 
2The photos depict the deceased in situ in the granny flat where the accused is alleged to have murdered her. The basis of the objection is under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, namely, that the probative value is said to be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The nature of the unfair prejudice is ostensibly that which is often said to occur with distressing photos, namely that there is a risk that the jury may make a decision on an improper or an emotional basis having seen the photos.  That basis could extend to an instinct to punish or inflict revenge on someone who has had some role in killing the deceased.
3During the course of argument, the Crown Prosecutor did not press for the admission of photos 31, 36, 37 and 39 but did seek to press photographs 24 and 25.  Photograph 24 shows the deceased in situ covered by a towel with a bloodstain near her head.  Photograph 25 is a closer up view which would also assist in considering whether there are evident injuries of strangulation. 
4The Crown case is that the accused bashed and strangled the deceased.  From the opening statements it is evident that it is in issue whether or not the accused formed the necessary intent to commit murder, in part because he was affected by his consumption of alcohol and also whether he acted in self-defence. 
5There are subsidiary factual disputes concerning the accuracy of various statements the accused is said to have made. These include his assertion to the police that when he departed from the granny flat he did not know the deceased was dead and whether he admitted killing the deceased in a telephone conversation with a friend. It is anticipated that the evidence will be that during the course of that conversation, he told the friend that a towel had been placed upon the deceased. 
6At least so far as those two subsidiary issues are concerned, it seems to me that those two photos have significant probative value. Moreover, the nuances that can often arise with questions of self-defence make it necessary for the jury to at least have in their own mind a good view of where the deceased's body ended, the state of the deceased's body, the relevant proximity of the bloodstain, and the manner in which she was left when the accused departed from the granny flat.  Bearing this in mind, photos 24 and 25 at this stage appear to be likely to have significant probative value.  I would not rate the prejudicial effect of these photos too highly, although that cannot be dismissed as they do show the deceased and they are clearly not pleasant. However, they are certainly not of the more gruesome kind that one sometimes sees depicted when tendered either in trials of this kind or in various television programs. 
7Thus, accepting there is some potential prejudice, it certainly does not rise to a level that I can conclude that the probative value of the photos is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 
8Accordingly, I will at the relevant time admit the tender of photographs 24 and 25.

                   Respondent
offered to sell an organ for a Washington couple and was given possession of it
for thirty days for this purpose. The organ was to be returned on the expiry of
that period if it had not been sold. The organ was not sold nor was it
returned. The owners were unsuccessful in locating either the respondent or the
organ. Respondent was arrested in Seattle, Washington, pleaded guilty to theft
in the second degree, and was sentenced to the maximum term of five years'
imprisonment. He escaped custody some months later and came to Canada.

 

                   Authorities
in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have respondent extradited
pursuant to the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976. Respondent
was committed for extradition. His application to the British Columbia Supreme
Court for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to quash the
warrant of committal was denied but the British Columbia Court of Appeal
allowed his appeal.

 

                   The
central issue here was whether the double criminality rule requires the elements
of the extradition crime to be the same in the requesting and the requested
state or whether it merely requires the act charged to be a listed crime in
both countries.

 

                   Held (Beetz,
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Estey,
Lamer, Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.: The double criminality rule is
conduct‑based. If it can be established that the fugitive's conduct
constituted the listed offence of theft in both Canada and Washington, the
double criminality requirement is met.

 

                   Respondent
was convicted in Washington of theft in the second degree. This crime, on its
face, does not include the requirement of fraudulent intent whereas theft in
Canada, as defined in the Criminal Code, expressly contains this
requirement. Accordingly, on the wording of the relevant statutory provisions,
absent further knowledge of the Washington law of theft in the second degree,
respondent's conduct would not constitute the offence of theft had it taken
place in Canada.

 

                   Double
criminality can be established in two ways. First, expert witnesses could be
called to testify that while fraudulent intent is not a requirement apparent on
the face of the Washington statute, it is nevertheless required by the law of
Washington. If this could be shown, then evidence of a conviction under
Washington law would constitute evidence that the fugitive's conduct would have
amounted to theft under Canadian law. No such expert evidence was led here.
Secondly, it could be established that the particular facts underlying the
Washington charge would, if replicated in Canada, constitute an offence under
either s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . This was not done
either.

 

                   The
extradition judge did not find on the facts evidence of fraudulent intent but
inferred such intent from the non‑return of the goods. Such an inference
cannot be made because failure to return goods within a reasonable time is
consistent with a number of explanations other than fraud. Appellant therefore
failed to establish that the respondent was convicted in Washington of an
extradition crime. Respondent's committal for extradition was not authorized by
s. 18(1) (a) of the Extradition Act .

 

                   Per Beetz,
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. (dissenting): The test for determining whether conduct
would constitute a crime in Canada is essentially the same in the case of a
convicted fugitive as it is in the case of an accused fugitive: whether the
conduct underlying the conviction, as it is described in the material before
the extradition judge, could support a conviction of the crime in Canada. Under
the applicable test the conduct underlying the conviction in the State of
Washington would constitute the crime of theft in Canada because the evidence
of that conduct before the extradition judge would support an inference of
fraudulent intent.

 

                   The
failure to comply with the requirements of Article 9(2) of the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976, did not render the committal invalid because it
did not go to the jurisdiction of the extradition judge.

                   The
reasons of Beetz, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

1.                       Le Dain J.
(dissenting)‑‑I would allow the appeal. While I agree with Justice
Wilson that what is in issue is whether the conduct underlying the conviction
in the State of Washington would constitute the crime of theft in Canada, I am
unable, with great respect, to agree with her conclusion that the evidence of
that conduct before the extradition judge would not support an inference of
fraudulent intent.

 

2.                       There
is obviously a necessary difference in the wording of s. 18(1) (a) and
18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act , the one referring to the proof
of conviction in the case of a convicted fugitive, the other referring to the
evidence that would justify committal for trial in the case of an accused
fugitive. I am unable, however, to conclude from this necessary difference in
wording that the test or standard for determining whether the conduct
underlying the conviction in the foreign state would constitute a crime in
Canada should, or as a practical matter can, be essentially different from the prima
facie test applicable in the case of an accused fugitive. In the
application of that test to a case of conviction the extradition judge is not
in the position of determining guilt or innocence or weighing the evidence any
more than he is in the case of an accused fugitive. In the case of a convicted
fugitive the test must be whether the conduct underlying the conviction, as it
is described in the material before the extradition judge, could support a
conviction of the crime in Canada. As long as inferences can be drawn from the
facts as established, it is irrelevant whether or not a particular trier of
fact would do so.

 

3.                       The
extradition judge described the relevant facts as disclosed by the documentary
material before him as follows:

 

                   The circumstances of the case against
Johnson were before the trial judge at the time of sentencing and appear in the
material filed. They disclose that in February 1979 a Mr. and Mrs. George Ford
of Enumclaw, Washington, placed an ad in a Seattle newspaper offering to sell
an organ. They were contacted by Johnson who persuaded them to enter into a
thirty day consignment agreement with him and to deliver the organ to him. Two
low offers were received and communicated to the Fords who turned them down.
One week after the thirty day period had expired the Fords tried to contact
Johnson but he had disappeared, as had the organ. Johnson was later located in
Calgary, Alberta. Johnson remained at large until arrested in 1982.

 

4.                       In
determining whether the conduct described by those facts would constitute the
crime of theft in Canada, the extradition judge, in my respectful opinion,
correctly applied the applicable test in the following passages of his reasons
for judgment:

 

                   In my opinion those facts are such as
to provide prima facie proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s.
283  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can
be inferred by the failure to return the goods within a reasonable time.

 

                   Johnson in an affidavit filed in
these proceedings deposed to facts which, if believed, would negate the element
of fraudulent intent. It is not the function of the extradition judge to weigh
or consider different views of the evidence but for the purposes of the proof
of double criminality to assess whether there is sufficient prima facie
evidence to establish the commission of a Canadian crime.

 

5.                       The
failure to return the organ within a reasonable time, from which the
extradition judge held that an inference of fraudulent intent could be drawn,
must be seen in light of the fact that both Johnson and the organ had
disappeared and that he could not be located until he was arrested in 1982. The
circumstances in R. v. DeMarco (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.),
which was relied on by the respondent and is applied by Wilson J., were
materially quite different and so was the issue. In DeMarco, a married
woman with four children rented a car on June 19, 1971, for the purpose of
moving. The rental agreement stipulated that the car was to be returned the
next day, but it was not returned until the police reclaimed it near the
accused's house on July 16th. At the trial the accused testified that she never
intended to steal the car. After moving she had filled out a forwarding address
card at the post office, and then used the car to drive her children to school
from time to time, and to take them on vacation. She testified that she
""just assumed they knew that I had the car"", and that she was
intending to return it and pay for it one month after she rented it, i.e., July
19th, three days after it was seized. The Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction and ordered a new trial on the grounds, stated by Martin J.A. at pp.
373 and 374, that the trial judge's direction to the jury ""failed to make
clear to the jury that if the accused had any honest belief in a state of facts
which if they existed would constitute a legal justification or excuse for her
retaining the car such belief itself negatived theft"" and that ""there
was non‑direction amounting to misdirection in failing to direct the jury
with respect to what was necessary to be proved in order to satisfy the
requirement of a fraudulent intention on the part of the appellant in
accordance with the authorities . . . .» In my respectful
opinion, DeMarco is not authority for the proposition that an inference
of fraudulent intent could not be drawn from the failure to return the organ in
the circumstances of the present case.

 

6.                       Having
come to this conclusion on the principal issue, it is necessary for me to
address the respondent's alternative contention that the failure of the
requesting state to comply with all the requirements of Article 9(2) of the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976, rendered the committal by the extradition judge
invalid. Article 9(2) provides that the request for extradition shall be
accompanied by, inter alia, ""the text of the laws of the requesting
State describing the offense and prescribing the punishment for the
offense."" The information by which the respondent was charged referred to
s. 9A.56.020(1)(a) of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), but the
request for extradition was not accompanied by the text of that provision,
although it was accompanied by the text of other provisions of the Revised
Code of Washington respecting the crime of theft in the second degree,
which were placed before the extradition judge. In my opinion the failure of
the requesting state to comply with Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not affect
the jurisdiction of the extradition judge to issue a warrant for committal
pursuant to s. 18(1) (a) of the Extradition Act . Article 9(2)  is
directed, as Article 9(1)  indicates, to the request for extradition through
diplomatic channels and not to the proceedings before an extradition judge.
There is nothing in the relevant provisions in ss. 10  and following of the Extradition
Act  to suggest that compliance with Article 9(2) of the Treaty is a
condition precedent to the exercise of the extradition judge's jurisdiction.
That it is not is an implication of the cases, with which I agree, in which it
has been held that it is not necessary to place the request for extradition in
evidence before an extradition judge: Re Von Einem and Federal Republic of
Germany (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (B.C.C.A.) I am accordingly of the view
that the failure to comply with Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not render the
committal invalid.

 

7.                       For
these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and restore the warrant of committal issued by Cowan Co. Ct. J.

 

                   The
judgment of Estey, Lamer, Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. was delivered by

 

8.                       Wilson J.‑‑This
appeal requires us to consider the precise nature of the double criminality
rule in extradition law. The question is whether the party seeking extradition
must establish that the offence charged in the foreign state is an offence in
Canada or whether it is sufficient to show that the conduct charged would have
amounted to a Canadian crime listed in the Treaty had it taken place in this
country.

 

I The
Facts

 

9.                       On
May 18, 1979, the respondent was charged in the State of Washington with the
crime of theft in the second degree. The information reads as follows:

 

                   I, Norm Maleng, Prosecuting Attorney
for King County in the name and by the authority of the state of Washington, by
this Information do accuse Melford Keith Johnson, of the crime of theft in the
second degree, committed as follows:

 

                   That the defendant Melford Keith
Johnson, in King County, Washington, on or about February 20, 1979, with intent
to deprive another of property to wit: a Lowrey Organ, did exert unauthorized
control over such property belonging to Mr. and Mrs. George Ford; that the
value of such property did exceed $250:

 

                   Contrary to RCW
9A.56.040(1)(A).020(1)(a), and against the peace and dignity of the state of
Washington.

 

The
material facts underlying the charge are as follows. In February 1979 a
Washington couple, the Fords, placed an advertisement in a Seattle newspaper
offering to sell a ""Lowrey"" organ. The respondent Johnson offered to attempt
to sell it for them. Johnson and the Fords entered into an agreement giving
Johnson possession of the organ for thirty days after which he was to return
the organ if it had not been sold. During the thirty‑day period Johnson
referred two offers to the Fords; the Fords rejected the offers because they
were too low.

 

10.                     At
the expiry of the thirty‑day period the organ was not returned. The Fords
attempted to locate Johnson and the organ but were unsuccessful on both counts.

 

11.                     Johnson
was arrested in Seattle, Washington, on May 8, 1982. He pleaded guilty to the
offence of theft in the second degree and was sentenced to the maximum term of
five years' imprisonment. On December 26, 1982 Johnson escaped from prison. He
left the State of Washington and came to Canada. At the time of his escape
fifty‑two months of his sentence remained to be served.

 

12.                     Authorities
in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have Johnson extradited
pursuant to the terms of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976.
On September 7, 1983, an information was sworn before a Vancouver extradition
judge stating that Johnson was a convicted fugitive who had escaped from
custody in Washington. The judge issued a warrant for the apprehension of
Johnson pursuant to s. 10(1) of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21.
Johnson was arrested on September 13, 1983, and was released on bail pending
the extradition hearing. After a number of delays the hearing was finally held
on July 27, 1984, before Cowan Co. Ct. J. sitting as an extradition judge.

 

II The
Courts Below

 

British
Columbia County Court

 

13.                     On
July 27, 1984, Cowan Co. Ct. J. ordered Johnson committed for extradition. He
noted that no warrant for committal of Johnson to await extradition could issue
unless it was established that Johnson had been convicted of an
""extradition crime"" as defined in s. 2  of the Extradition Act 
and Article 2 of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976. The
critical point to be determined in order to resolve this issue, he stated, was
whether the offence met the ""double criminality"" requirement of
Article 2 of the Treaty.

 

14.                     Cowan
Co. Ct. J. held that it did. He rejected the argument that the double
criminality rule required that the offence charged have an equivalent in the Criminal
Code  of Canada. ""It is sufficient"", he said, ""to produce
prima facie evidence of facts that amount to a Canadian crime listed in the
treaty"". Applying this test he held that the . . . ""facts are such as
to provide prima facie proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s.
283  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can
be inferred by the failure to return the goods within a reasonable time"".
Double criminality, therefore, could be made out despite the fact that there
was no evidence that the Washington offence of theft in the second degree
contained an element of fraudulent intent.

 

15.                     Cowan
Co. Ct. J. also rejected the respondent's argument that his committal would
constitute a violation of his rights under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The respondent did not argue s. 7  in this Court.

 

 

British
Columbia Supreme Court

 

16.                     The
respondent applied for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to
quash the warrant of committal made by Cowan Co. Ct. J. Ruttan J. denied the
application concluding that Cowan Co. Ct. J. had correctly stated and applied
the double criminality rule.

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal

 

17.                     Taggart
J.A. for the Court allowed Johnson's appeal. He concluded that, while the lower
courts correctly stated the double criminality rule, they applied it
incorrectly because it was not established that Johnson's conduct would have
constituted the offence of theft had it taken place in Canada. The record
provided no evidence of the fraudulent intent necessary for a conviction under
s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . Taggart J.A. stated:

 

                   Now, unfortunately, what is missing
from the material is anything showing what must be proved in Washington State
to support a conviction for second degree theft. Certainly s. 9A.56.040 makes
no reference to the element of fraudulent intent. The information which I have
quoted makes averments which appear not to be included in the section. From
that I assume, but making it clear that I have no way of knowing with
certainty, there are other statutory provisions in Washington State setting out
with more particularity what must be proved in order that a conviction for
second degree theft may be entered. Those other provisions, if they exist, are
not before us. Without them, I am unable to say the appellant was convicted of
an extradition crime as required by s. 18(1)(a) of the Act. Unless one can say
with certainty that he was convicted of an extradition crime, and I cannot, the
order sought by the Washington State authorities ought not to be made.

 

He later
qualified this by stating:

 

My brother Lambert has quite correctly pointed out that
in the course of my reasons for judgment I said unless we can say with
certainty that the appellant was convicted of an extradition crime in the State
of Washington the extradition order sought by the Washington authorities ought
not to be made. I think the term certainty is much too strong. It would have
been preferable to say only that there is before us, and there was before the
extradition judge, no evidence from which the conclusion could be drawn that an
extradition crime had been committed by the appellant in the State of
Washington.

 

The
Court of Appeal therefore allowed the appeal, quashed the warrant of committal
and ordered Johnson released from custody. His release was made subject to
""the proviso that the appellant is not at the present time necessarily
detained to answer other charges that may be pending against him"".

 

III The
Issue

 

18.                     The
issue in this appeal is whether the British Columbia Court of Appeal erred in
concluding that there was no evidence that Johnson committed an extradition
crime in the State of Washington. In order to determine this we must examine
the nature of extradition crimes generally and the double criminality rule in
particular.

 

(a) Extradition
Crimes

 

19.                     The
extradition of convicted fugitives between Canada and the U.S. is governed by
Canada's Extradition Act  and by the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition
Treaty, 1976. Section 3  of the Extradition Act  provides:

 

                   3. In the case of any
foreign state with which there is an extradition arrangement, this Part applies
during the continuance of such arrangement; but no provision of this Part that
is inconsistent with any of the terms of the arrangement has effect to contravene
the arrangement; and this Part shall be so read and construed as to provide for
the execution of the arrangement.

 

This
section of the Act incorporates the Treaty into domestic law. Extradition must
therefore be conducted in accordance with both the Act and the provisions of
the Treaty: see Government of the Republic of Italy v. Piperno, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 320, at p. 324.

 

20.                     Committal
for extradition is authorized by s. 18(1)  of the Extradition Act  which
provides:

 

                   18. (1) The judge
shall issue his warrant for the committal of the fugitive to the nearest
convenient prison, there to remain until surrendered to the foreign state, or
discharged according to law,

 

(a) in the case of a fugitive alleged to have
been convicted of an extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would,
according to the law of Canada, subject to this Part, prove that he was so
convicted, and

 

(b) in the case of a fugitive accused of an
extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would, according to the law
of Canada, subject to this Part, justify his committal for trial, if the crime
had been committed in Canada.

 

Thus,
the requirement for a committal under para. (a) is simply proof that the
fugitive has been convicted of an extradition crime. ""Extradition
crime"" is defined by s. 2  of the Extradition Act  read in
conjunction with Article 2(1) of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty,
1976. These two provisions read as follows:

 

                   2. ...

 

""extradition crime"" may mean any crime that,
if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of the
crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the case
of any extradition arrangement, ""extradition crime"" means any crime
described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule;

 

                                                               Article
2 

 

(1) Persons shall be delivered up according to the
provisions of this Treaty for any of the offenses listed in the Schedule
annexed to this Treaty, which is an integral part of this Treaty, provided these
offenses are punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties by a term of
imprisonment exceeding one year.

 

Among
the crimes listed in Schedule 1 to the Extradition Act  are the
following:

 

                   5. Larceny or theft;

 

                   7. Obtaining money or goods, or
valuable securities, by false pretences;

 

                   9. Fraud by a bailee, banker, agent,
factor, trustee, or by a director or member or officer of any company, which
fraud is made criminal by any Act for the time being in force; [Emphasis
added.]

 

It would
appear, therefore, that the offence of which Johnson was convicted was listed
in the Schedule annexed to the Treaty under one or more of the above items.
Article 2(1) of the Treaty, however, requires that the offences be
""punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties"". This is the
double criminality rule, the precise nature of which is in issue on this
appeal.

 

(b) The
Double Criminality Rule

 

21.                     The
central issue to be addressed in determining the nature of the double
criminality rule is whether the rule requires the elements of the extradition
crime to be the same in the requesting and the requested state or whether it
merely requires the act charged to be a listed crime in both countries. Cowan
and Ruttan JJ. in the courts below believed that the latter was adequate. The
Court of Appeal seems to have disagreed and proceeded on the basis that the
elements of the crime must be the same in both states. Which is correct?

 

22.                     The
learned writers seem to be in agreement that the double criminality rule looks
to the conduct of the individual whose extradition is being sought. Gerald V.
La Forest, in his text Extradition To and From Canada (2nd ed. 1977),
defines an extradition crime as follows at p. 42:

 

An extradition crime may broadly be defined as an act of
which a person is accused, or has been convicted, of having committed within
the jurisdiction of one state that constitutes a crime in that state and in the
state where that person is found, and that is mentioned or described in an
extradition treaty between those states under a name or description by which it
is known in each state. This definition can be broken down into several
propositions:

 

(1)               the act charged must have been
committed within the jurisdiction of the demanding state;

 

(2)               it must be a crime in the
demanding state;

 

(3)               it must also be a crime in the
requested state; and

 

(4)               it must be listed in an
extradition treaty between the two states under some name or description by
which it is known in each state.

 

I read
the word ""it"" in each of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) as referring
back to ""the act charged"" in paragraph (1); that is, we are directed
to examine the conduct which gave rise to the conviction or charge in the
foreign state.

 

23.                     Ivan
A. Shearer, in his text Extradition in International Law, 1971, also
emphasizes the conduct‑based nature of the test. He states at
p. 137:

 

The basic rule observed by the enumerative and `no list'
treaties alike is the rule of double criminality. This rule requires that an
act shall not be extraditable unless it constitutes a crime according to the
laws of both the requesting and the requested States.

 

24.                     The
double criminality rule has not received a great deal of judicial attention in
Canada. However, it was addressed in Cotroni v. Attorney General of Canada, [1976]
1 S.C.R. 219. In that case the issue was whether conspiracy to import a
narcotic was an extradition crime within the meaning of the Extradition Act .
This Court held that conspiracy to import narcotics fell into the list of
offences laid down in the extradition arrangement between Canada and the United
States. The Court then proceeded to the double criminality issue. It found that
the accused could have been charged under a Canadian Criminal Code provision
had his conduct taken place in Canada. Spence J. stated for the unanimous Court
at p. 222:

 

                   I am of the opinion that it matters
not whether the particular indictment, had it been laid in Canada, would have
been laid under the provisions of the Criminal Code  or the Narcotic
Control Act or in fact any other statute. The test is what is the essence
of the crime charged.

 

It is
clear that the Court did not require an exact identity between the offence
charged in the requesting state and the Canadian offence. This case, therefore,
seems to support the proposition that the double criminality rule focusses on
the criminal conduct of the person whose extradition is being sought.

 

25.                     This
position is bolstered by a consideration of the purpose of the double
criminality rule. Ivan A. Shearer suggests in his text that the double
criminality rule has its roots in the doctrine of reciprocity. He states at pp.
137‑38:

 

                   The validity of the double
criminality rule has never seriously been contested, resting as it does in part
on the basic principle of reciprocity, which underlies the whole structure of
extradition, and in part on the maxim nulla poena sine lege. For the
double criminality rule serves the most important function of ensuring that a
person's liberty is not restricted as a consequence of offences not recognized
as criminal by the requested State. The social conscience of a State is also
not embarrassed by an obligation to extradite a person who would not, according
to its own standards, be guilty of acts deserving punishment. So far as the
reciprocity principle is concerned, the rule ensures that a State is not
required to extradite categories of offenders for which it, in return, would
never have occasion to make demand. The point is by no means an academic one
even in these days of growing uniformity of standards; in Western Europe alone
sharp variations are found among the criminal laws relating to such matters as
abortion, adultery, euthanasia, homosexual behaviour, and suicide. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Thus,
following this reasoning, if it could be established that the conduct of the
fugitive constituted the listed offence of theft in both Canada and Washington
the double criminality requirement would be met.

 

26.                     I
would agree, therefore, with the appellant's contention that the double
criminality rule is conduct‑based.

 

IV The
Application of the Rule

 

27.                     Mr.
Johnson was convicted in Washington of theft in the second degree. This offence
is defined as follows:

 

9A.56.040. Theft in the second degree

 

                   (1) A person is guilty of theft in
the second degree if he commits theft of:

 

                   (a) Property or services which
exceed(s) two hundred and fifty dollars in value, but does not exceed one
thousand five hundred dollars in value; or

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2) Theft in the second degree is a
class C felony.

 

The
Washington law, it will be noted, does not on its face include the requirement
of fraudulent intent. The Criminal Code  sections that define the crime
of theft in Canada do, however, expressly contain this requirement. The
relevant sections read as follows:

 

                   283. (1) Every one
commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or
fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of
another person, anything whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

 

(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the
owner of it or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the
thing or of his property or interest in it,

 

(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security,

 

(c) to part with it under a condition with
respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to
perform, or

 

(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it
cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or
converted.

 

                   290. (1) Every one
commits theft who, having received anything from any person on terms that
require him to account for or pay it or the proceeds of it or a part of the
proceeds to that person or another person, fraudulently fails to account for or
pay it or the proceeds of it or the part of the proceeds of it accordingly.

 

                   294. Except where otherwise
provided by law, every one who commits theft

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) is guilty

 

(i) of an indictable offence and is liable for
imprisonment for two years, or

 

(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction,

 

where the value of what is stolen does not exceed two
hundred dollars.

 

Accordingly,
on the wording of the relevant statutory provisions, absent further knowledge
of the Washington law of theft in the second degree, it cannot be said that
Johnson's conduct would give rise to a conviction for theft had it taken place
in Canada.

 

(a) The
Case for the Appellant

 

28.                     It
was the position of counsel for the appellant in this Court that neither the Extradition
Act  nor the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976 required
proof of the elements of the crime in the requesting state or a correspondence
of such elements with the elements of the crime under the laws of Canada. The
Court of Appeal erred in thinking that they did. All that had to be shown, the
appellant submitted, was that the offence of which the fugitive had been
convicted was listed in the Treaty, i.e., theft, and that ""theft"" is
an offence under the Criminal Code . The double criminality rule, he
submitted, required only that the conduct be criminal in both States but not
that the elements of the offences be the same. In other words, ""theft in
the second degree"" in the State of Washington does not have to equate
""theft"" under the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

29.                     Counsel
for the appellant relied on the House of Lord's decision in In re Nielsen,
[1984] 1 A.C. 606, for the proposition that proof of the law of the requesting
state was not required on an extradition hearing, only a description of the
conduct leading to the conviction in that state. The sole issue was whether
that conduct would constitute a crime in Canada also. He pointed out that the
extradition judge in this case, having reviewed the conduct of the fugitive,
concluded: ""In my opinion those facts are such as to provide prima facie
proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s. 283  or s. 290(1)  of the
Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can be inferred by the
failure to return the goods within a reasonable time"".

 

(b) The
Case for the Respondent

 

30.                     Counsel
for the respondent directed our attention to the difference between s. 18(1) (a)
and s. 18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act . Section 18(1) (a),
he pointed out, deals with the circumstance where the fugitive has been convicted
in the foreign state and s. 18(1) (b) with the circumstance where the
fugitive has been charged in the foreign state. He submitted that where
there had been a conviction, as in this case, the only question is whether the
offence of which the fugitive was convicted is an extradition crime. Where,
however, the fugitive has merely been charged in the foreign state the
requirements are different. Not only must he have been charged with an
extradition crime but such evidence must be produced ""as would, according
to the law of Canada . . . justify his committal for trial, if the crime had
been committed in Canada"". It is, counsel submitted, under s. 18(1) (b)
that the issue of prima facie proof justifying committal arises. It does
not arise under s. 18(1) (a) which is the applicable provision in this
case. I would respectfully agree with this submission.

 

31.                     Counsel
submitted further that there are two ways in which the appellant could
establish under s. 18(1) (a) that the crime of which the fugitive had
been convicted was an extradition crime. He could prove the foreign law under
which the fugitive was convicted. This would have to be done in the manner
required for proof of foreign law in a Canadian court. This route was not
followed. Or he could produce the description of the conduct for which the
fugitive was convicted and it could then be determined whether or not that same
conduct taking place in Canada would constitute the offence here. This was
done. However, the description of the conduct for which he was convicted did
not, counsel for the respondent submitted, constitute an offence under either
s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . A necessary element for a
conviction under either of these sections was a fraudulent intent and there was
nothing in the description of the conduct for which the fugitive was convicted
in the State of Washington to indicate the presence of such an intent.
Accordingly, he submitted, counsel for the appellant failed to prove that the
offence of which the fugitive was convicted was an ""extradition
offence"" within the meaning of the Extradition Act  and the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976.

 

32.                     I
agree with the respondent that there are two methods by which double
criminality could be established for the purposes of s. 18(1) (a). First,
it could be established that Washington law required fraudulent intent for a
conviction of the offence charged. This could be done either by showing that
the text of the offence includes a requirement of fraudulent intent or by
calling expert witnesses to testify that while fraudulent intent is not a
requirement apparent on the face of the Washington statute, it is nevertheless
required by the law of Washington. If either of these be shown, then evidence
of a conviction under Washington law would constitute evidence that the
fugitive's conduct would have amounted to theft under Canadian law. In this
case, however, the text of the foreign law provided by the requesting state
pursuant to Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not show that the Washington law
required fraudulent intent. Neither was any expert evidence called on this
issue.

 

33.                     The
second method of showing that the double criminality requirement had been met
would be to establish that the particular facts underlying the Washington
charge would, if replicated in Canada, constitute an offence under either s.
283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . This was not done either. The
facts underlying the Washington charge were laid out in the affidavits before
the extradition judge. However, the extradition judge did not find that the
facts contained evidence of fraudulent intent. He concluded rather that
""the element of fraud can be inferred by [sic] the failure to
return the goods within a reasonable time"". With respect, I disagree with
this conclusion. The failure to return goods within a reasonable time is
consistent with a number of explanations other than fraud. The non‑return
could be due to forgetfulness, error or inability. The element of fraud cannot
in a criminal prosecution be inferred from the fact of non‑return alone:
see, for example, R. v. DeMarco (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.)

 

34.                     I
would conclude, therefore, that the appellant has failed to establish that the
respondent was convicted in Washington of an extradition crime. It follows that
s. 18  of the Extradition Act  does not authorize his committal for
extradition.

 

35.                     The
appeal is accordingly dismissed. Costs were not asked for and I would, in any
event, make no order as to costs.

    3 On 5 December 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence that he did assault a named victim (“A”), and at the time of the assault, he did commit an act of indecency upon her, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she then being a person under the age of 16 years, namely, 13 years of age, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 61M(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 7 years imprisonment. A standard non parole period of 5 years is applicable to the offence. 
     
      
    4 On 24 May 2006 the applicant was sentenced for that offence in the District Court to imprisonment for a non parole period of 9 months commencing on 24 May 2006 and expiring on 23 February 2007, with the overall term of imprisonment being 2 years and 9 months, 2 weeks and 4 days commencing on 24 May 2006 and expiring on 13 March 2009. 
     
      
    5 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(c). The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The sentencing Judge erred in using inappropriate comparable cases to determine the range of sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentencing Judge erred in regarding herself as bound to impose a sentence of imprisonment; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    6 The facts of the offence, as recounted by the sentencing Judge in her Remarks on Sentence were: 
     
      
       
        
        The victim, A, has known the offender through their mutual involvement with swimming since she was around 7 years old. 
        
       
       
        
        When A first started school swimming, the offender was a senior student swimming in the senior squad. A swam in the juniors at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        In January 2002, after leaving school, the offender obtained a position as a swimming coach at a swimming club. In January of the following year the offender was involved in coaching A, and he continued as her coach until around July 2003. A was one of twenty or so children aged between 8 and 14 who were trained by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        On a day in May or June 2003, A was on the internet chatting on line with the offender. He made a number of suggestive comments to her in his messages. 
        
       
       
        
        The next day A attended swimming training where the offender was coaching her. A’s mother asked the offender to take A home after training. And so when training finished, the offender and A went to the offender’s car. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender drove off, but did not take A home immediately. He stopped at the carpark near a railway station, telling A he wanted to chat with her. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then leaned towards the passenger seat from the driver’s seat, and kissed A on the mouth, inserting his tongue into her mouth, She pulled away, and asked him what he was doing. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender told A to relax, and began to touch her with his hand. The victim said “no”, but the offender continued. He moved his hand inside the victim’s jeans, and then underneath her underpants. He began to touch her genitals. When A again asked him what he was doing, he again told her to relax, that he was exploring. The offender took hold of A’s hand and placed it on his groin area. The offender continued to touch A’s genitals for some moments before stopping and removing his hand from underneath her clothing. 
        
       
       
        
        A told the offender she needed to go home and he said he would take her home. The offender then drove her to her home. As she was getting out of the car, he told her not to tell anyone, saying that if she did “things won’t work out”. A told the offender that he was her swimming coach and she didn’t want things to work out. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of the incident A was aged just 13, and the offender was 19 years old. In late August 2003 A told her mother … what had happened and police were notified. 
        
       
       
      Ground One – The sentencing Judge erred in using inappropriate comparable cases to determine the range of sentence. 
       
      
    7 Her Honour in the course of her Remarks on Sentence reviewed 6 recent cases which her Honour’s researches had revealed. As the first 2 cases predated the commencement of the standard non parole period regime her Honour concluded they offered little or no guidance. The essence of the remaining 4 cases, as distilled by her Honour, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) 70 year old gymnastics coach touched breasts of 13 year old girl and patted her buttocks on outside of clothing – guilty plea – 12 months imprisonment partially suspended; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 44 year old male placed hands on outside of 13 year old girl’s clothing in area of her breasts and vagina, attempted to kiss her, prior similar offence – 4 years and 3 months imprisonment, non parole period 2 years and 9 months; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 67 year old male exposed penis, forced 12 year old girl onto bed demanding she have sex with him – girl escaped – 5 years 2 months imprisonment, non parole period 3 years and then there was a reduction of the non parole period from the original sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) natural father, whilst intoxicated, placed hand on vagina of his naked 9 year old daughter – plea of guilty – 3 years imprisonment non parole period 1 year 6 months. 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        To establish a range that precluded a non custodial sentence by reference to these cases was to ignore the very considerable distinctions between them and the present case. Most importantly to regard them as comparable was to ignore the relatively narrow gap between the ages of the applicant and the complainant. 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant’s submissions assumed that her Honour by reference to those cases alone established a range that precluded a non custodial sentence.  
     
      
    10 Her Honour’s reference to the cases was immediately preceded by the following remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        Counsel on behalf of the offender submits that other than a custodial sentence is appropriate. The Crown says that a non custodial option is within range. I do not agree. The judicial commission statistics are of little assistance, a review of recent cases is of more assistance. 
        
       
      
    11 The reference to the cases was immediately followed by: 
     
      
       
        
        I have given consideration to all of those cases to which I have referred, and I have given consideration to the sentencing options available to me. I have also given consideration to the submissions made on behalf of the offender, and by the Crown. However, only a sentence of full time imprisonment will satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. Had the matter proceeded to trial, I would have imposed a head sentence of 3 years and 6 months. 
        
       
      
    12 The matter is not completely clear but, in my opinion, the context is such as to lead me to conclude the consideration of the “comparable cases” was but one of the factors taken into account by her Honour in determining that a custodial sentence was appropriate in this case. Her Honour, in considering the matter, was mindful of the age difference as she specifically stated in her Remarks on Sentence that the applicant’s age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence and reduced what would otherwise have been a mid range offence into one at the lower end of mid range. In my opinion the applicant has failed to demonstrate error on this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two - The sentencing Judge erred in regarding herself as bound to impose a sentence of imprisonment. 
       
      
    13 Her Honour, in her Remarks on Sentence, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        The absence of a prior criminal record, and the fact that an offence occurs spontaneously are often features of cases of sexual assault upon children by adults. A sentencing decision which does not involve a period of full time custody because of the existence of these factors, either individually or collectively, will stand for nothing. 
        
       
      
    14 The applicant in his written submissions argued: 
     
      
       
        
        It is difficult to interpret this statement as other than a proposition that in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children a custodial sentence must be imposed. The statement ignores the vast range of circumstances – relative ages, degrees of “grooming” or pre mediation – that may be disclosed by the facts of an individual case. 
        
       
      
    15 Her Honour’s statement however, even when read in isolation, does no more than indicate that the absence of a prior criminal record and the fact the offence was spontaneous do not alone provide a reason why a full time custodial sentence should not be imposed. Her Honour explained why in the balance of that paragraph in that: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that a person is of otherwise good character enables them to gain the position where they can gain exposure to children, and be in a position of authority over them. That is not to say that I find this offender was such a person. I refer to the principle because in a case such as this, prior good character carries very little weight. There is a much greater need for emphasis to be given to general deterrence in the sentencing exercise. 
        
       
      
    16 That her Honour was not advancing a proposition that in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children a custodial sentence must be imposed is apparent when regard is had to her Honour’s comments elsewhere in the Remarks on Sentence where she refers to the state of the law prior to the implementation of the standard non parole regime as one in which this Court had declined to lay down any requirement that a custodial sentence should ordinarily be imposed in relation to the charge of indecent assault. Her Honour then referred to the standard non parole period regime as being the clearest indication that the Court should regard these offences as being objectively very serious but she did not conclude that the effect of that regime was to make a custodial sentence mandatory in all cases of sexual assault by adults upon children. As her Honour observed, the standard non parole period was not binding where the offender had pleaded guilty. I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three - In all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    17 In R v Allpass 72 A Crim R 561 at 563 the Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        A sentencing Judge, in determining what punishment to impose upon an individual who has broken the law, will often need to take into account a complex combination of facts and circumstances. The Judge must never lose sight of, or fail to give due weight to, the objective seriousness of the offence. On the other hand, the subjective characteristics of the offender will usually be of relevance, and sometimes of great relevance, in determining the appropriate punishment for the conduct in question. 
        
       
      
    18 As to the objective seriousness of the offence her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        This is not a situation where there was a brief touching of a young girl on the outside of her clothing, it was an unwelcome advance over quite some time, with many warnings to him that what he was doing was wrong. … He saw an opportunity and seized upon it to sexually assault this young girl. A young girl who looked up to him as her swimming coach, … at a time she had been entrusted into his care by her mother to deliver her home safely. … he knew full well what he did was wrong, and he knew full well if his actions were discovered, he would find himself in the very position he is in today, facing sentence for committing a very serious offence. … He is one of those offenders who having committed an offence, goes about his daily life not expecting his victim to come forward and complain, confident that he has been successful in his threat over her not to tell. Confident that his good character will stand him in good stead, oblivious to the harm he may have caused to his victim, either in the short or long term. Confident that the complainant will be too embarrassed, afraid or inhibited by feelings of guilt to complain. ,,, The offence for which he now faces sentence is one which clearly demonstrates a loss of control over his impulses. There can be no other explanation for his offending other than for his own gratification. It certainly cannot be attributed to a clouding of the mind by drugs or alcohol. 
        
       
      
    19 It may be added that A was born on 26 February 1990 and was thus at a very important developmental stage of her life. At that age a difference of 6 years between victim and offender is significant. However, in the absence of evidence, her Honour was unable to find that the emotional harm suffered was substantial. 
     
      
    20 As to subjective characteristics the applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. In addition, a probation and parole service Pre Sentence Report and a psychologist’s report were tendered on his behalf. Evidence was also given by a family friend who spoke highly of him. Her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The applicant was born on 29 December 1983. He completed his Higher School Certificate and commenced a Bachelor of Science degree at University, but left after completing 12 months at the end of 2002.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) He was employed as a swimming coach. He had been a competitive swimmer himself since 13. He had volunteered at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the Sydney Olympics. He is currently employed in the family engineering business. It was apparently his dream to become an Air Force pilot. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) He did not suffer from any psychological, pathological or personality disorder and could give no satisfactory explanation for his behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) He had no criminal record at the time of this offence but on 18 October 2004 he was fined for maliciously destroying or damaging property. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) He had demonstrated some remorse and contrition.  
        
       
       
        
        (f) The offence had not been planned.  
        
       
       
        
        (g) His prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he was unlikely to re-offend.  
        
       
       
        
        (h) His age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) As a result of the plea of guilty on the first day of the trial the applicant was entitled to a discount of 20 percent. 
        
       
      
    21 Her Honour took, as her starting point, a head sentence of 3 years and 6 months which she discounted by 20% to allow for the plea of guilty. She found special circumstances and significantly varied the statutory non parole period. In doing so she took into account the applicant’s youth, his prospects for rehabilitation, the fact that this is the first time he will find himself in custody and no doubt his time will be spent on protection. Her Honour fixed a non parole period of 9 months. 22 The applicant contended: 
     
      
       
        
        In terms of objective circumstances more weight should have been given to the relative ages of the applicant and the complainant, to the spontaneous nature of the offence and to the fact that it occurred in a location where the sexual activity was unlikely to have developed beyond what occurred. While it was open to find that there was a breach of trust and authority the circumstances here are a world away from the case of a mature and significantly older adult in the family, employment or school situation who breaches that trust. It was open to the sentencing Court to have imposed a non custodial sentence. Such a sentence would have been an appropriate disposition of the matter. 
        
       
      
    23 In Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213 the High Court held at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review revealed, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached … As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies. 
        
       
      
    24 Her Honour took into account each of the subjective and mitigating factors. She gave such matters the weight which she considered appropriate. She closely considered whether a non custodial sentence was appropriate and concluded it was not. She found the applicant’s age lessened the objective seriousness of the offence and that had he been older she would have found it to be a mid range offence. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the offence was serious in its nature and it was open to her Honour to impose a full time custodial sentence. It is not open to this Court to interfere with that decision.  
     
      
    26 How a particular sentence is to be quantified according to correct principle will always come down, ultimately, to that process of “instinctive synthesis” of which the relevant authorities speak: Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213. In my opinion, that process, when applied to the given facts of the present case, suggests that the starting point taken by her Honour, of 3 years and 6 months discounted by 20%, yields a head sentence that is very severe. I have given anxious consideration to the question whether that head sentence can fairly be accepted as falling within the relevant range of sentence properly open to her Honour. I have concluded, but not without hesitation, that it can, albeit the sentence is, in my opinion, at the upper and outer limit of that range. 
     
      
    27 Even had I come to the contrary conclusion, the applicant would have faced great difficulty in challenging the non-parole period set by her Honour. The discounted head sentence set by her Honour would have entailed, absent a finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period in the order of 2 years. The finding of special circumstances by her Honour resulted in the setting of a non-parole period of about one-third of that term. I do not see any margin of possible adjustment of the discounted head sentence that would justify a reduction in a non-parole period of 9 months. 
     
      
    28 This is a Court of error. It does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing Judge was in error, and then only if it forms a positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed – R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79], Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3). 
     
      
    29 In my opinion error has not been established nor has it been established that some sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Whilst I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal.

    30 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted;

      2008/2836 R v ADAM NEWBOLD 
       
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 25 August 2008 the Crown presented an indictment against Michael Kutschera and Adam Newbold. The indictment charged one count of murder contrary to s 18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the particulars of which being that on 21 July 2007 at Muswellbrook in the State of New South Wales they murdered Lucas Gleeson.  
     
      
    2 Michael Kutschera applied for a separate trial on the basis that in a joint trial highly prejudicial and inadmissible material would be productive of a real risk that the Crown case against him would be made immeasurably stronger and that an unfair trial would result. That evidence comprised a record of interview where Mr Newbold identified him as the driver of the vehicle which was deliberately driven at and over the deceased and which resulted in his death.  
     
      
    3 For the purposes of considering that application I viewed the record of interview in its entirety. Over the course of the interview which commenced at 11.23am and concluded at 1.35pm on 21 July 2007, Mr Newbold gave a detailed account of the order and sequence of his movements from the evening of the 20 July 2007 and into the early morning hours of the 21 July 2007 leading up to his arrest shortly after 3.30am that morning.  
     
      
    4 In considering whether to grant the application for separate trials it was neither necessary nor appropriate for me to express any view as to whether or not the exculpatory account he gave to police in so far as his involvement in the death of the deceased was concerned was true, accurate or reliable. Suffice to say that in my published judgment (R v Kutschera; R v Newbold, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 26 August 2008) I expressed the view that were his account to be viewed by the jury as true, or even possibly true, there was a certain risk that they would import into their consideration of the guilt of Kutschera wholly inadmissible and prejudicial evidence which even the most carefully crafted and emphatically delivered directions to the jury could not guard against. It was for those reasons that I granted Kutschera a separate trial.  
     
      
    5 I also directed that Mr Newbold’s trial follow immediately upon the resolution of Kutschera’s trial and, in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings generally, I directed that there be no publication of the pre-trial proceedings or their outcome. 
     
      
    6 The only evidence in the Crown case contradicting Mr Newbold’s account to police to the effect that rather than being jointly responsible for the death of the deceased he was an unwilling witness to the killing, came from Tony Matthews who claims to have identified Mr Newbold as a passenger in the car as it drove over the deceased in the course of two discrete driving manoeuvres. Even in advance of being called as a witness in Kutschera’s trial, in my assessment the various accounts Tony Matthews gave to police were less than compelling. Having heard him give evidence I regard his reliability generally as undermined by his level of intoxication and his evidence identifying Mr Newbold as the passenger undermined by the compromised circumstances in which the identification was made.  
     
      
    7 In circumstances where Mr Newbold’s opportunity to have joined with Kutschera in obtaining access to the car and driving it at the deceased was on the Crown case scant to say the least, my own independently held view at the time at separating the trials (although not at the time expressed) was that the case against Mr Newbold was weak and that the very high probability favoured his account being in fact truthful, accurate and reliable such that were to have been I invited by defence counsel to give a Prasad direction at the end of the Crown case in his trial I would in all likelihood have done so.  
     
      
    8 After publishing my judgment on the application for separate trials, and without opposition from the Crown, I released Mr Newbold to bail being satisfied in accordance with s 9C of the Bail Act 1978 that the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to justify a grant of bail on the most relaxed of conditions. 9 Despite the Crown opening Kutschera’s trial on the basis that he and Mr Newbold were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to murder the deceased (a position which I fully accept the Crown Prosecutor quite properly opened having regard to the evidence and the inferences available to be drawn from the evidence as he saw them) during the course of the trial I was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had been invited by defence counsel to review his decision to present an indictment against Mr Newbold for murder by actually viewing the ERISP. It was counsel’s view that, together with the detailed account given by Mr Newbold, his demeanour during the course of the record of interview, and the animation with which he persistently denied various propositions put to him by interrogating police, were matters properly to be taken into account by the Director in considering whether or not to proceed against him for murder.  
     
      
    10 I am not aware as to whether or not the record of interview was viewed for this purpose and I am not aware of any particular view that may have been reached by the Director as to the weight of evidence in the Crown case to justify proceeding with the murder charge. Suffice to say that I was notified on 8 September 2008, that the Director had resolved to accept pleas of guilty to comparatively minor charges in full discharge of an indictment charging Mr Newbold with murder and to call Mr Newbold as a witness in Kutschera’s trial.  
     
      
    11 Since the presentation of Kutschera’s case to that point had been cast on the express basis that the Crown would not call Mr Newbold, I discharged the jury. This was not met with any resistance from the Crown. Kutschera’s trial is listed to recommence before me today. I anticipate the fresh indictment will contain one count of murder with Kutschera named as the only offender.  
     
      
    12 Mr Newbold was re-arraigned before me yesterday. He entered a plea of not guilty to murder and not guilty to a charge of affray pursuant to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act. He pleaded guilty to a charge that on 21 July 2007, knowing or believing that Kutschera had murdered Lucas Gleeson, he failed, without reasonable excuse, to bring information which may have been of material assistance in securing the apprehension and prosecution of Kutschera to the attention of a member of the police force, that information being that Kutschera was the driver of a vehicle that had run over and caused the death of the deceased. That charge is laid pursuant to s 316(1) of the Crimes Act and, on indictment, carries a maximum penalty of 2 years. It is a matter that was susceptible to summary disposition under Table 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    13 He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting Lucas Gleeson and thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act, a charge which on indictment carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. It is also an offence susceptible to summary disposition under Table 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    14 The facts upon which it is agreed that sentence is to be passed in respect of the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        About 2.30 am on 21 July 2007 Mr Newbold left the Railway Hotel at Muswellbrook in the company of numerous patrons and headed in the direction of Sydney Street. At that time he was in the company of Michael Kutschera who resided at 98 Sydney Street.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        After walking for some minutes he arrived at the intersection of Maitland and Sydney Streets which is an intersection controlled by traffic control signals. He waited for a green “walk” signal and was soon thereafter approached by a group of people including Tony Matthews Brogan Barnes Orre Davison and the deceased.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        A verbal dispute broke out between the two groups of men. Newbold was assaulted by one of the men and Mr Kutschera was assaulted by Mr Matthews and others. Mr Newbold ran away from the area chased by Davison and Brogan. He hid on a veranda of a nearby house for several minutes waking the occupants of that house.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He left his hiding place walked back in the direction he had come from at which time he saw the deceased standing on the footpath of Sydney Street near a tire dealership. Mr Newbold argued with the deceased and they physically struggled with each other in the course of which Mr Newbold punched the deceased and pushed him forcefully to the ground causing him to connect heavily with the concrete. As a result the deceased was lying on a concrete in a barely conscious state.  
        
       
      
    15 It is this latter course of conduct that constitutes the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It is agreed that the actual bodily harm is constituted by a head injury of some unspecified kind which was occasioned when the deceased’s head impacted with the concrete of the footpath causing a lapse of consciousness. The evidence is unclear as to the duration of any loss of consciousness. On any view it could not have been for longer than a minute or two before which a vehicle driven by Kutschera drove up onto the footpath and over the body of the deceased resulting his almost immediate death.  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Newbold left the scene in the front passenger side of the vehicle and was driven away from the scene. He was driven to Mr Kutschera’s home a relatively short distance away where he got out of the car and remained. According to Mr Newbold Mr Kutschera then left the scene for a brief period and upon his return informed Mr Newbold he had driven over the deceased a second time. The offender then ran from Mr Kutschera’s place to his own home where he was met shortly thereafter by Mr Kutschera.  
        
       
      
    16 It is of fundamental importance to the sentence proceeding, no less than for Mr Newbold as the person to be sentenced, to emphasise that he bears no criminal responsibility of any kind for the death of the deceased, it being no part of the Crown case on sentence that he had prior knowledge of Kutschera’s intention to obtain and use his motor vehicle for the purpose of driving it at the deceased, much less that he agreed with him that that should occur. In fact I accept, without reservation, that Mr Newbold was nothing other than an unwilling witness to the killing of the deceased by Kutschera and, moreover, that it was a matter of sheer happenstance that he was in the company of the deceased at that time at all.  
     
      
    17 I also accept that his horror at witnessing the incident was genuine in the moment and that it was expressed with spontaneous emotion on repeated occasions throughout the record of interview when he gave the police a graphic description of what he had seen. I also accept that the horror of the night is the product of nightmares that are persistent and continuing.  
     
      
    18 The facts relating to the second count of conceal serious offence are, in summary, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Newbold and Kutschera returned to where the deceased had been run over where uniformed police arrived at the scene at about 3.30am by which time the deceased had been confirmed dead by attending ambulance officers. The police spoke with Mr Matthews at the scene who informed them of the fight he had witnessed between the deceased and Mr Newbold before the deceased was run over by the vehicle. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        A shirt time later Constable Smith saw Mr Newbold and Mr Kutschera walking in the middle of Sydney Street toward the crime scene. Constable Lea informed Newbold that he was under arrest “for further questioning about a hit and run incident that had occurred this morning”. Mr Newbold responded “What do you mean, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        At the time of this exchange Mr Newbold was standing in the presence and hearing of Kutschera. He was thereafter removed to a caged police truck where he became emotional and distressed. He said to Constable Smith “I will tell you what happened”. They then recorded what Mr Newbold said to them in the following terms: 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        “There was this Lucas guy, he is a friend of my girlfriend. This Lucas guy, he had a go at me. Five black fellows come up and one of them hit me. I ran to a house up there. They tackled me to the ground. I ran back, I tried to run back there. I jumped the fence and the house ad a white lattice and I knocked on the door and I hid. I can show you if you want.” 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He then pointed in the direction of Sydney Street where the house was located. He then noticed that the deceased was on the footpath and said “that Lucas?” he began then to sob uncontrollably and said, “we had a fight”. He was then asked by Constable Smith about a car involved in the incident and replied, “please don’t tell him I told you, he knows the bikies and they will hurt my family. The car is a silver Nissan Patrol four-wheel drive. There’s a sticker on the rear. His name is Mick, everyone calls him Osama because he looks like Osama Bin Laden.”  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He then started to cry uncontrollably. Constable Lea then asked him who the driver of the car was at the time he replied that the driver was Kutschera and he offered to show the police where the car was. He said he was not in the car at the time and that he only got into the car afterwards. Kutschera was arrested by police at his home without incident at about 9 am that morning.  
        
       
      
    19 I accepted the plea of guilty to the charge of conceal serious offence despite Mr Newbold’s expressed fears to police that Kutschera would hurt him or his family, which it might be inferred was also operating on his mind were he to have contacted police and informed them of what he had seen. It is the Crown case that he could have and should have either gone to the police station directly from Kutschera’s house before Kutschera drove back to the scene for the second driving manoeuvre, or after he ran from Kutschera’s house and before Kutschera came to his house presumably with the intention of preventing him from alerting police. That said, on any view the act of concealment was of short duration, in my estimation no longer than half an hour given that he volunteered the very information he is charged with concealing when he was arrested. The gravamen of the criminality in his conduct, in my view, is his return to the scene with Kutschera and his initial denial when told he was under arrest for questioning about a hit and run incident.  
     
      
    20 In all the circumstances (and without recourse to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) I consider that the offending constituted by both offences is of the lowest order of objective criminality comprehended by the sections under which the charges are laid. 21 I am compelled to add that I have persisting doubts as to whether the charge of conceal serious offence, or a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, would ever have been preferred against Mr Newbold were police to have taken the view that he was in fact telling them the truth and were they to have offered him the opportunity to sign a witness statement against Kutschera. While I accept that this was not a view that commended itself to police either on the 21 July 2007 or as the investigation proceeded, the simple fact is that Mr Newbold spent 400 days in custody as a remand prisoner facing a murder charge - a charge which he denied on the night of his arrest, that he has persistently denied throughout successive arraignments and a denial that the Crown ultimately accepts as true.  
     
      
    22 I acknowledge, of course, that our system of criminal justice has as its pinnacle the jury system as the established mechanism by which the guilt of those charged with serious indictable offences is determined. Nonetheless, the responsibility for ensuring that only those against whom a positive case of guilt can be mounted ought to be put to their trial rests first with the investigating police and then with prosecuting authorities in the independent exercise of their statutory powers. In my view, the need for judgments made at the point of arrest and charge to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and well in advance of trial is essential, especially where the person arrested and charged voluntarily participates in a recorded interview and gives an exculpatory account that is neither inherently improbable nor, in the context of other evidence, plainly untenable. In my view this case falls squarely into that category.  
     
      
    23 Mr Newbold is a man who has no relevant criminal record. He is currently 24 years of age and, until he was bail refused in respect of the charge of murder, he had not spent any time in prison.  
     
      
    24 At the time of his arrest he was working full-time in the motor trade installing mufflers for a small business in Muswellbrook. He was hopeful of commencing an apprenticeship after having left school at year 10 and having worked in various semi-skilled jobs since that time. He was also the father of a young son with whom I understand he enjoyed a very close relationship. He was also in a stable relationship with the child’s mother who was due to deliver their second child within weeks of his arrest. At the time of his arrest I accept that he was genuinely committed to supporting his partner and his children by honest and hard work.  
     
      
    25 As a result of his incarceration his relationship with his former partner has been severed (it would seem at her initiation) and he has lost contact with her and his children. His suffering and loss over the last year is of untold measure. In addition, as an inevitable consequence of his arrest and incarceration he lost his job, his tools of trade and the immediate prospect for his future advancement.  
     
      
    26 Since his release to bail he is in receipt of Centrelink benefits although he has been unable to apply for full-time work with the present proceedings pending and has, in any event, been reluctant to do so having regard to the fact that it was only on Monday of this week that he learnt that the Director of Public Prosecutions was no longer intending to prosecute him for murder. The stress and uncertainty to which he has been subjected is also of untold measure.  
     
      
    27 Mr Newbold gave evidence before me that he told the truth to police in his record of interview, that he has told the truth in an induced statement he gave to police a week ago and that he is willing to give evidence in accordance with what he has told police as a witness in Kutschera’s trial. That is a matter which I propose to take into account on the question of sentence in accordance with s 23 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. In compliance with s 23(2) of the Act I regard the significance and utility of his assistance as considerable, that his account is in fact truthful, complete and reliable and, notwithstanding the fact that the offer to give assistance was made more than 12 months after the deceased’s death, it is nevertheless timely given that he was at all times, until very recently, being treated as a co-accused at trial and not as a person whose assistance might be sought.  
     
      
    28 Since I do not propose to impose any period of imprisonment in respect of either charge I do not have to take into account whether or not Mr Newbold will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance. I need only note that he has served over 12 months as a remand prisoner which in all the circumstances is a punishment he has suffered and a punishment which was wholly unwarranted. 
     
      
    29 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires me to take into account both aggravating and mitigating and other factors material to the sentencing exercise. I am also mindful of the purposes of sentencing to which s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act refers.  
     
      
    30 I am satisfied that none of the 21 individual aggravating features under s 21A(2) of the Act are made out in the present case. By contrast, I am satisfied that there are matters mitigating the offending constituted by each of the counts to which pleas of guilty have been entered. I am satisfied that the offending was not part of a plan or organised criminal activity and, so far as the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the deceased is concerned, I am satisfied that while the offence was committed in circumstances that do not amount to provocation at law the offending has to be seen in the context of the fact that Mr Newbold was himself was the victim of an assault at the deceased’s hands in the immediately preceding incident. I also accept that although Mr Newbold’s pleas of guilty were not early in a strictly temporal sense, the offence of conceal serious offence was at all times the subject of inclusion on a section 166 Certificate under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 31 I am satisfied that at the time of the offending not only that Mr Newbold had no significant record but that he was in all respects a person of good character. I am satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has by his plea of guilty, by his conduct on the morning he was arrested and by his attitude and demeanour throughout the course of the proceedings before me, accepted full responsibility for his actions and that he deeply and lastingly regrets placing himself in a situation where, by association with Kutschera, he has himself committed criminal offences and being witness to the criminal conduct of another that has resulted in the loss of life.32 In respect of the charge of conceal serious offence I propose to utilise the provisions s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, without proceeding to conviction, I find Mr Newbold guilty of that offence and direct that the charge be dismissed. In reaching that conclusion I have had regard to his character, antecedents, age and the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was a committed, in particular, that he was a witness to a horrifying event for which he bore no criminal responsibility, that he was, in a notional sense at least, subject to Kutschera’s influence in the aftermath of the killing and that the offence was of very short duration.  
     
      
    33 In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm I convict Mr Newbold but dispose of the sentence proceeding without imposing any penalty in accordance with the provisions of s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have utilised the power under this section having reached the positive conclusion that even were the matter to have proceeded by way of a plea of guilty, the alternatives to full-time imprisonment would have been utilised since s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. Since Mr Newbold has served over 12 months on remand in respect of an offence he did not commit, I do not propose to utilise other sentencing alternatives. In particular, I am not satisfied that the imposition of a good behaviour bond or a community services order is warranted.

1632,2225503,R v Benjamin Curtis,"Guildford Crown Court 

R ‐v‐ Benjamin Curtis 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Nicol 

17th June 2013  

You may stay seated for the time being. 
 
Benjamin Curtis you have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott. 
 
Ocean was 3 ½ months old in April 2007. She was your child and in your sole care. Like most babies, 
she cried. You picked her up and shook her 4 or 5 times. You may have been tired. You may have 
been uncertain as to how to placate Ocean. You may have been cross with your partner. But none of 
that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that baby. 
 
The results were catastrophic.  A baby that young has undeveloped neck muscles. If  shaken violently, 
her head will have swung back and forth and her brain will have knocked against the inside of her 
skull. The brain injury which resulted had devastating effects. She was severely disabled. She could 
not sit on her own, let alone walk. She was functionally blind. She could not clear her lungs properly 
in the way that everybody else takes for granted. She had to be fed through a tube inserted into her 
body. In the course of 2009 she contracted pneumonia and then later swine flu. She suffered from 
seizures.  As time progressed these occurred every day and were difficult for even doctors to control. 
Her distress was clear to those who were caring for her. 
 
You have already been prosecuted once for inflicting really serious harm on Ocean. You were 
acquitted of intentionally causing her really serious harm. I acknowledge that what you did not with 
intentional malice to that baby. The conviction for assault  was in February 2008. But at that time, 
Ocean was still alive. The present case started after her death. Consequences matter and when the 
consequences become the more serious, they can lead, as in your case, to more serious charges. 
 
You are now 30 years old. I have seen and taken into account the pre‐sentence report which was 
prepared for the previous case. That notes you have a learning disability and a limited ability to 
understand verbal information. Your previous convictions and police record are not material to the 
task I have to perform with two qualifications. One is the assault on Ocean which I have already 
mentioned and to which I will return. The other is that you were cautioned in 2006 for hitting 
Ocean’s step‐brother on  his bare bottom. That, too, was, it seems, in a fit of temper. 
 
The pre‐sentence report also recognised that you had taken full responsibility for your actions. You 
pleaded guilty to the assault on Ocean, although only on the day of your previous trial.
--------
In these proceedings you have not resiled from your admission of responsibility for shaking Ocean. 
You did originally plead not guilty to the present charge, but, I accept that this was because of two 
matters which turned on expert evidence: whether your conduct was a significant contributory cause 
to Ocean’s death 2 ½ years later; and whether Ocean’s brain injury could possibly have been due to 
some other non‐accidental injury. These were not matters within your own knowledge. It was only 
last week that your legal team obtained clear evidence from the experts they had commissioned to 
say that it was plain your shaking had been a contributory cause of death and it was not possible that 
the injury to Ocean’s brain could have been the result of any earlier incident. This is therefore an 
unusual case where the lateness of  your plea of guilty should not be held against you. I will give you 
full credit for it. 
 
I also recognise that you have been previously prosecuted for the same wrongful act. I will, of course, 
make a reduction for the sentence which was then imposed. But over and above that, I should mark 
that this is the second time you have been through criminal proceedings and, as your counsel 
submitted, you did have to wait over 3 years after Ocean’s death before you were charged with 
manslaughter and learned that you were indeed to face a second prosecution. In that interval, you 
were convicted of another offence, but it was of a quite different kind and the magistrates thought it 
could be dealt with adequately by a conditional discharge and a restraining order. It is therefore of 
little importance in my decision in the present matter. 
 
Your counsel recognises that this offence is so serious that only a sentence of immediate 
imprisonment will be sufficient.  
 
Taking all of this into account (including the sentence which was passed on you for the assault on 
Ocean) but assuming you had contested the present charge, my sentence would have been 3 years 
imprisonment. Because of your plea of guilty, the sentence will be one of 2 years imprisonment.  
 
Stand up. 
 
Benjamin Curtis for the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott you are sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.

4978,2702397,R v Melmeth [2015] NSWSC 1762,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	On 18 November 2015 the applicant pursued her application to be released on bail, having been charged with serious offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of wound person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(a)) and detain in company (s 86(3)). She has been in custody bail refused since her arrest on 30 May 2015.
	
	
	The applicant is next due before the Newcastle Local Court on 2 December, when the balance of the brief is due to be served. The charges involve a co-accused and a victim, on the applicant’s case another drug user, who claims to have been detained by the two accused, threatened, forced to use a drug and very seriously assaulted. The charges are defended.
	
	
	There is no issue that it is likely that there will be a very considerable further delay in the matter going to trial in the District Court. The applicant has been advised that it will not be heard before October 2016. That is not disputed.
	
	
	The Crown opposes bail.
	


The show cause obligation


	
	At common law a person seeking bail is entitled to the presumption of innocence and has a general right to be at liberty. Those remain relevant considerations when this bail application is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	There is no issue that s 16B of that Act imposes an onus on the applicant to show cause why her detention is not justified. Accordingly, this application must be refused, unless the applicant satisfies that obligation. Whether that burden has been met is in issue.
	
	
	Determination of this bail application involves a two-step process, even though matters relevant to the show cause test relied on by the applicant are also relevant to the question of bail concerns which the applicant poses and the unacceptable risk test which must be considered in accordance with s 17, s 18 and s 19 of the Act, if cause is shown.
	
	
	The applicant relies on a combination of factors to satisfy the show cause requirements of s 16A. Under that section, however, the question of whether the applicant has satisfied the obligation to show cause that her detention is not justified, is not confined to matters relevant to bail concerns and the assessment of risks, which must be determined in accordance with other statutory provisions. Further, the statutory tests may not be conflated, as is discussed in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	
	
	The matters on which the applicant relies include evidence she has given as to her serious ill health and the ongoing problems it has caused during her first time in custody with its management, as well as other evidence as to her health and personal circumstances, and the stringent conditions of bail which she proposes in order to address the bail concerns and risks identified by the Crown, namely risks of failing to appear and of committing a serious offence (s 17(2)(a) and (b)).
	
	
	The application has to be decided on the balance of probabilities (s 32), taking into account evidence or information considered to be credible or trustworthy in the circumstances. It is not to be undertaken according to the laws governing the admission of evidence (s 31).
	
	
	The applicant is aged 30 years. Her application is supported by her parents. She has been the sole carer of her 8 year old son since he was aged 4. He has been cared for by the applicant’s mother, since she drove him home to learn from the applicant’s neighbour, that the applicant had been arrested the previous day. Her mother had received no contact from police, or any other enquiry as to his welfare. She described her concerns about the impact of the applicant’s bail refusal on the applicant’s deteriorating health, as well as on the wellbeing of her grandchild, in a letter in evidence. There is also in evidence, a letter from the applicant’s father, with whom it is proposed she would reside, if granted bail.
	
	
	The applicant is a type 1 diabetic. On 28 July, two Justice Health certificates were issued by Dr Meldrum, at the Dillwynia Correctional Centre, certifying that the applicant has poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetes, causing her to have some blurred vision and dizziness on frequent bending, as well as a past history of pneumothorax. He recommended that she have 3 blankets at night and that she be allowed regular breaks and avoid frequent bending.
	
	
	These certificates provide for custodial officers to indicate their receipt. They are, however, unsigned. The certificates also provide:
	


“This certificate lists a requirement of the Justice Health for appropriate management of the health needs of this inmate.

Local health staff are to be directly advised by custodial staff if the requirement cannot be met so that satisfactory alternative arrangements can be agreed.

In the absence of such advice, it will be assumed that the recommendations have been carried out. Custodial staff may request a review of the requirement by their clinic staff if they consider it necessary or desirable.”


	
	In a letter of 28 August 2015, Mr Connally, a registered nurse and credentialed diabetes educator at the Nepean Diabetes Service, advised Dr Meldrum that adjustments were required to manage the applicant’s diabetes. He recommended:
	


“insulin:

Novorapid 4-12 units at meals - Currently Carly states she gets her Novorapid at least 30 mins before she eats. Novorapid's onset is within 10 minutes. Then she bases her next dose on her current BGL. This is not ideal. Carly has done carb counting before where would estimate her next dose based on the carbs she was about to eat. This generally leads to better control. I would therefore recommend

•   Insulin to be given immediately with food to avoid hyoglycaemia

•   Dose decided on the carbs about to be eaten not on the current glucose level. Carly was originally having between 1 & 2 units per 15gms of carbohydrate and is able to discern this. We can always arrange a dietitian appt to confirm this if necessary. I have given Carly an insulin pen which measures in ½ units so she can try, for example, 1 ½ units per carb. This pen requires a penfill cartridge.

•   She needs to have a BGL around 2 hours after dinner to assess the effect of her dinner dose of Novorapid

Lantus 22 units at dinner - Because the slow acting Lantus is given so early i.e. 4.30 pm it has less chance of improving the fasting level often leading to increased doing and consequent hypoglycaemia in the middle of the night. I would suggest:

•   Reducing the dose to 20 units

•   Giving the Lantus at the time of testing 2 hours after dinner which will allow more of it to be working by morning”


	
	In a letter of 20 September, the applicant stated that no attempts had been made in custody to respond to this advice. The result was that daily, she was experiencing symptoms of blurred vision, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, being off balance and sweating. She was also suffering swelling of her ankles, which she was concerned could indicate a diabetic related kidney problem. She also feared that some of these symptoms could precede a diabetic coma.
	
	
	On 10 September the applicant was transferred to Mulwala. She said that she had not received insulin before she left, or until some hours after her arrival there. She was then left in a cell, having not eaten since 8.30 am and despite using the medical emergency button, was not given insulin at the correct times, or given food until 3 pm. She requested to see a nurse, because she was feeling unwell, with blurry vision, sweating and was feeling faint. The response was that she was processed last. The applicant said that she began fearing for her life and was left begging to see a nurse. Another inmate responded to her distress, by providing her with a mintie. When she saw a nurse she was handed the wrong insulin. The result of her anger and frustration over her treatment was that she was put in a detox cell, where she was kept under camera observation in a lit room, for a week
	
	
	On 12 September, whilst at the clinic, she did not receive her long lasting insulin or prescribed medication which helped her sleep. The medical button she later used was not responded to. She also said in her evidence that her blood sugar tests in custody, which give an average reading of sugar control over a 3 month period, have gone up, indicating poor control.
	
	
	The applicant also gave oral evidence that since her September letter, there had not been anything done to improve her health. She had been kept in a cell with no food for a number of hours; she had been left there when she requested to see a nurse, even after pressing the emergency button; she had a special diabetic tester which would help monitor her diabetes, to which she was not allowed access in custody; she saw an endocrinologist on 13 November, who had provided a letter, which she understood said that the tester would improve her health and recommended what needed to be done in relation to her diabetes; the letter had been taken by Corrective Services and she had not been able to get it back.
	
	
	The applicant also said that she needed more insulin, in order to bring her sugar levels down; that she needed to receive her insulin injections at the same regular times daily; and that she also needed to be given food on a regular basis, as well as access to her diabetic tester, if her condition was to be controlled. Why she could not get a prescription for that tester in custody, had not been explained to her.
	
	
	In cross-examination the applicant agreed that Justice Health had made an appointment for her to see an endocrinologist at Nepean Hospital, although she said first, it had only made an appointment with a diabetic educator. She had then waited 3 months to see the endocrinologist.
	
	
	The applicant also said that daily she suffers symptoms of blurred vision, slurred speech, sweating and shakiness and that not receiving regular insulin could cause hypoglycaemic episodes. She agreed that insulin was not being withheld from her and that the reason she was not receiving the insulin she required, was because she was in the prison system. She also said that she regularly had to advise officers that she was an insulin dependent diabetic and that she had begged for her records to be checked, but on occasions had been laughed at and told to sit down before she fell. She said that she found her circumstances to be very distressing.
	
	
	When questioned as to the last occasion on which she did not get her insulin when she needed it, her evidence was that it was two days previously, when taken to Newcastle for court, when the truck was 2 hours late. The result was that she was on the truck for three and a half to 4 hours and had to request a muesli bar. When questioned as to whether she had complained, she said that she had raised her concerns with her solicitor and had also made a complaint to the Health Commission
	
	
	Despite this evidence the Crown’s attitude remained that the application for bail was opposed. I indicated that it seemed to me that the evidence potentially provided a basis on which it could be concluded that cause had been shown. The Crown then sought an adjournment, in order to meet the evidence which had been led in support of the application .
	
	
	A short adjournment of the hearing on 18 November was not opposed by the applicant, but the date the Court had available, 20 November, suited neither party. It was thus listed for further hearing on 24 November. The Crown then raised another difficulty in obtaining the evidence it required, by that date:
	


“LAIRD: I had a matter before McCallum J earlier this year where I asked a Justice Health to prepare a report. They refused to do a report unless directed by the Court.

HER HONOUR: I direct Justice Health produce a report.

LAIRD: And a report would normally take between four and six weeks.

HER HONOUR: I direct Justice Health produce a report for the Court to consider at the adjourned hearing of this application on Tuesday 24 November at 9.30am.

LAIRD: If no report is produced I think there is sufficient material for your Honour to have overcome the show cause issue.

HER HONOUR: You need to have an opportunity, but it needs to be a reasonable one in the circumstances. It is a question of this material being directed to the relevant person, then that person taking the time to produce the report.”


	
	In order to address the difficulty which had been raised by the Crown, the direction was made in the form of an order, which was conveyed later that day to Justice Health.
	
	
	On 19 November the order elicited a response directed to the Court Registry in these terms:
	


“Please be advised that any kind of medical report takes 4 weeks to complete, so without sufficient time we are unable to comply with this request. Even pulling out all stops (transfer of medical records, allocation of a clinical director) there simply is not enough time.

I spoke to David Laird from the ODPP regarding this matter this morning and I understand he was going to subpoena production of the medical records to Court which may resolve the matter.

As an aside, this matter seems to be a patient complaint and I would encourage the patient to use the many channels available to her should she have any concerns regarding her care or treatment provided by Justice Health. She is able to speak to the Nursing Unit Manager, Health Care complaints Commission or NSW Ombudsman should she have a complaint she wants to be investigated.”


	
	That same day on the Crown’s application a subpoena was issued to the Department of Corrective Services, requiring the production of the applicant’s Justice Health file to the Court. At the resumed hearing on 24 November, the Court’s order had not been complied with, nor had the applicant’s Justice Health file been produced to the Court.
	
	
	The resourcing difficulties with which the Department of Corrective services is currently contending, given record numbers of persons held in custody in NSW, are a matter of common knowledge. Nevertheless, the difficulty with Justice Health’s response to an order of the Court made on a bail application such as this, when a Crown application for an adjournment is granted and the order is made at its request, is patent. So is the problem with the response to the subpoena or rather the failure to respond to the subpoena. Both of these difficulties will be dealt with separately, when Justice Health appears before the Court to explain its failures to obey the Court’s order and the subpoena.
	
	
	At today’s hearing the Crown was not in a position to lead further evidence to respond to the case advanced at the earlier hearing by the applicant. A further adjournment of the release application was sought, in order for evidence to be pursued. The adjournment was opposed. It was not granted. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Crown had had a fair opportunity to obtain evidence to meet the case advanced on this application. In the circumstances I was well satisfied that the dictates of justice required the refusal of the adjournment application and the hearing of the bail application to finality today.
	
	
	On all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the applicant has met the obligation to show cause. That was not seriously in issue at the resumed hearing.
	
	
	Despite the seriousness of the offences with which the applicant is charged, the management of her potentially life threatening illness in custody is such that I am satisfied that given the significant further delay before any trial in the District Court, of up to a further year, that the applicant’s continued detention in custody pending the hearing is not justified. That conclusion is reinforced by the evidence before the Court as to the bizarre nature of the alleged offending, on the Crown case, offending in which the applicant was involved while adversely affected by drugs. In her evidence the applicant said that her decision to take drugs was the worst she had made in her life. That recognition, when considered together with the other evidence before the Court as to the conditions under which the applicant is kept during her first time in custody, her limited record of past offending and the stringent conditions which will be imposed on her when released on bail, made the conclusion that the applicant’s further detention prior to trial unjustified, unavoidable.
	
	
	Detention while bail refused, in this case for some 18 months before any trial, ought not give rise to such significant risks to an applicant’s health as have here been established on the evidence this applicant is being subjected to in custody, notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges which she faces and the possibility that a lengthy custodial sentence will be imposed upon her, if she is convicted.
	


Bail concerns and unacceptable risks


	
	That conclusion means that the questions of bail concerns and unacceptable risks must be considered in accordance with the statutory requirements.
	
	
	There was no real issue that the applicant posed the bail concerns identified by the Crown, given the serious offences with which she is charged, involving as they did alleged forced drug taking, serious assaults and threats to the victim’s life.
	
	
	Whether the risks which she poses in relation to those bail concerns were shown not to have been unacceptable ones, was however in issue. They have to be assessed in light of the evidence as to the relevant matters, particularly those specified in s 18.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that given the strength of the case against the applicant; that her alleged victim was known to her; that she had invited him to the premises where she and the co-accused had subjected him to serious threats, intimidation, assaults, constraint and physical and mental torture, until he was able to escape and contact police, after telling a witness repeatedly that he had been stabbed and that the accused were going to kill him, and that he was found on examination to have been suffering stab wounds to his upper right arm and left elbow, as well as rope burns to his wrists and ankles and swelling to his face, as well as cuts and bruises, it could not be concluded that the risks which the applicant posed were not unacceptable ones.
	
	
	While it was acknowledged that the applicant’s criminal record was short, with no failures to appear, it was submitted that she had a longstanding drug addiction and on the occasion of this offending, had injected herself with an unknown substance, shortly before the events the subject of the charges had unfolded. It was also relevant that she had been on bail in relation to another offence, when those alleged offences were committed. In the result the Court could have no confidence that if released on bail the applicant would either appear, or comply with the other conditions of bail imposed on her.
	
	
	On all that was before the Court, I have concluded that given the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s diabetic illness and what its management requires, which is not being adequately attended to in custody; her personal circumstances, including her need to have access to ongoing, adequate treatment for her serious illness; her need to care for and live for her son; the very long further delay before her trial is heard; the bizarre offences which it is alleged she committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise upon her alleged victim, who on her unchallenged evidence was a former solicitor struck off for his own drug abuse, when she is alleged not only to have herself injected an unidentified drug in a syringe prepared by the victim, but then to have been present while the victim was forced by her co-accused to inject himself with that drug and having done nothing to assist the victim, other than to provide him with a bandage for his cut arm, while he was repeatedly assaulted and threatened with a gun and knives, before being bound so loosely that he was able to untie himself and escape, all the while behaving herself in an entirely irrational way; her very limited record of offending of any kind; her recognition of the very poor decisions which she made when taking the drugs which so adversely affected her; that this is her first time in custody; and the stringent bail conditions which will be imposed upon her to reside with her father, that the applicant does not pose an unacceptable risk in relation to the concerns identified by the Crown as to flight and further serious offending.
	
	
	True it is that the place where she will be bailed to live is where she assaulted her father’s former partner, an assault which resulted in a conviction and a s 9 bond being imposed upon her, it appears at a time when also drug affected. It is relevant that this relationship has ended, and it appears, otherwise on the material before the Court that the residence with her father is an appropriate one.
	
	
	Any grant of bail cannot, of course, be guaranteed to be risk free. On this application, however, I am satisfied in light of all of the matters I have discussed, that the stringent bail conditions which will be imposed on the applicant will mean that the risk which she poses, if released on bail, will not be an unacceptable one.
	


Conditions of bail


	
	The conditions of bail imposed on the applicant are as follows:

5559,2705747,Col v R [2013] NSWCCA 302,"Judgment
1LATHAM J : The appellant, Murat Col, appeals against his conviction after a trial before Lakatos SC DCJ in August 2011 with respect to the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1990.  There is no appeal against sentence.
The Crown Case
2At the time of the offence, the appellant was 40 years of age and lived with his de facto partner, Maryanne Scott, who was the victim of the offence.  The circumstances of the offence summarised below derives substantially from a statement provided by the victim to police but retracted shortly before the appellant's trial.
3On 7 August 2009, the appellant attended an evening barbeque.  At around 8:30 pm the victim called the appellant on his mobile phone, becoming upset because she had expected the appellant to be home by that time.  Later on, the appellant tried to call the victim several times but the victim did not answer the phone.
4The appellant returned home at approximately 10 pm.  The victim accused him of lying about the presence of women at the barbeque.  The appellant became angry that the victim had not answered her phone.  The victim went upstairs, put on her pyjamas and got into bed.  The appellant came into the bedroom, told her she could not sleep, and dragged her from the bed by her pyjama pants, tearing the drawstring of her pyjama pants.
5The appellant dragged the victim down the hallway and partially down the stairs.  The victim told the appellant to stop as he was hurting her and he did so.  She returned to the en suite bathroom in the bedroom and took off her pyjama pants.
6The appellant followed her with her mobile phone in his hand and proceeded to smash it.  He hit the victim in the face with the back of his hand and she went back to bed.  The victim heard the appellant making noise downstairs in what sounded like the opening and closing of cupboards.
7The appellant came upstairs and said to the victim that he would burn the bed or the house or ""it all down"".  The victim felt liquid being splashed across her and the bed.  She recognised the smell as being methylated spirits.  The victim jumped up and knelt on the bed, facing the appellant and said to him, ""What are you doing?""  She heard him flicking a cigarette lighter a couple of times, causing the methylated spirits to ignite.
8The victim saw flames all over her and heard the appellant say, ""Oh, fuck"".  The victim ran into the spare bedroom whilst trying to remove her jumper.  She threw the burning jumper onto the floor of the spare room and ran back towards the shower.  The appellant grabbed her and carried her to the shower in the main bathroom where she stayed until the flames were extinguished.  The victim cried for the appellant to get help. 
9At 11:55 pm, the appellant called ""000"", telling the operator, ""Methylated spirits, got ah, ignited and we got burnt"".  At midnight on 8 August 2009, the appellant called ""000"" again.  The appellant is recorded as saying, ""Don't tell them...Don't tell the cops please...""  Later during the call, the victim is heard saying, ""I won't say anything"" to which the appellant replies, ""Do not say what happened"".  The victim says to the appellant, ""You're too good to me"".
Circumstances Following the Offence  
10When the ambulance arrived, an ambulance officer, Kiri Muller, asked the victim what had happened.  The victim claimed that there had been an accident.
11A senior ambulance officer, Jacqueline Christian, treated the victim in the ambulance.  Ms Christian asked the victim, ""Did he do this to you?"" The victim replied, ""Yes"".  The victim said that she had been trying to get away from the male in the bed and he had poured ""metho"" on the bed and set it alight with a cigarette lighter.  
12Ms Muller was driving the ambulance back to the hospital when she heard Ms Christian say to the victim, ""So he did this to you"".  Ms Muller did not hear the victim's reply but saw the victim nodding when she looked in the rear view mirror.  As a result of this, Ms Muller decided to contact the police.
13The victim underwent two surgical procedures and remained in the Intensive Care Unit at Concord Hospital.  She later underwent a third procedure.
The Victim's Accounts to Family and Friends 
14The victim's sister, Leanne Scott, visited the victim on the night of 8 August 2009.  The victim was unable to speak as there were breathing tubes going down her throat.  She communicated with Ms Scott by writing on three pieces of A4 paper.  The victim wrote,  ""We had a fight, he had a lighter, he flick it and my clothes went up"".  She also wrote ""I'm not charging him"" and ""He didn't mean it"".  
15The following day, the victim was able to speak.  She told Ms Scott that she had been lying in bed when the appellant kicked and punched her, and the next minute he had flicked the lighter and she was on fire.  On 10 August 2009, Ms Scott attended the police station and handed over the three A4 pages with handwriting.  The A4 pages were dated and signed by Ms Scott on 10 August 2009. 
16A friend of the victim, Vicky Faulds, visited the victim on 9 August 2009.  The victim told Ms Faulds that she had argued with the appellant about women being present at the barbeque, as the appellant had informed her that it was a male only event.  She also told Ms Faulds that the appellant had been angry with her for refusing to answer the phone and that the appellant had taken her mobile phone and smashed it.  The victim said that the appellant dragged her downstairs and pushed her against a wall and hit her.  After the victim went back to bed, she said the appellant came into the bedroom and threw some ""metho"" at the quilt.  The appellant had a lighter in his hand and when the methylated spirits ignited the victim ran out of the bedroom and ripped off her pyjama top.  The victim said that she raced to the shower whilst the appellant was trying to put out the fire in a pile of clothes that had caught alight in the spare room when the victim had thrown her burning pyjama top onto it. 
17The victim asked Ms Faulds not to say anything about what she had told her.  When Ms Faulds asked the victim whether the appellant had thrown the methylated spirits at her, the victim replied ""no"" and said it was thrown on the quilt and that he had not meant it.  However, the victim said later that there had been a fight in which the appellant had thrown the methylated spirits at her and had teased her with the lighter while standing at the foot of the bed. 
18Another friend of the victim, Michelle Brown, first visited the victim on 8 August 2009, thereafter visiting her around 3 times a week.  During one of her visits, the victim told Ms Brown that the appellant had caused her injuries, asking, ""Why would he do this?""  The victim told Ms Brown that there had been a fight during which the appellant had said that if the victim did not get out of bed he would douse her with ""methyl"" and that he was ""flickering the light, and then it just went up"".  The victim also told Ms Brown that the appellant had told the victim to tell the ambulance officers that it had been an accident.  
19The victim's son, Ryan Coyne, first visited the victim on 8 August 2009, thereafter visiting her daily until 30 October 2009 when she was discharged.  In a conversation that took place about two weeks after the first visit, the victim told Mr Coyne that the appellant had thrown methylated spirits on her and had set her on fire.  
20A friend of the victim, Leah Tasker, visited the victim on 9 August 2009.  On that day, she entered the room on her own to find that the victim's sister Ms Scott was also in the room.  The victim told Ms Tasker and Ms Scott that she and the appellant had been arguing, that he was punching her when she asked him to stop and that she had wanted to sleep.  
The Victim's Statement to Police and its Retraction.
21On three separate occasions on 24 and 27 August and 3 September 2009, a police officer, Plain Clothes Constable Heffernan, visited the victim for the purposes of obtaining a statement.  Constable Heffernan brought with him the three A4 pages that the victim had written and that Ms Scott had brought in to the police station.  Constable Heffernan also had pictures of a broken mobile phone.  In the statement she provided to police, the victim gave a detailed account of the events of the night which was consistent with the accounts already provided to her family and friends, and confirmed that she recognised some of the writing on three A4 pages as being her handwriting.  She also stated that three photos of a broken mobile phone shown to her were those of her phone that had been smashed on the night.  The statement was dated 24 August 2009 and the bottom of each page was signed by the victim
22On 28 July 2011, the victim faxed a handwritten statement to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the legal representatives of the appellant.  The victim claimed that she had been heavily sedated and not fully conscious at the hospital when her friends and family had ""told [her] what they thought had happened on the night"".  She also wrote that her statement to police was ""not the truth"" and that she had no recollection of the events described upon reading it again.
23During the trial the victim was cross-examined by the prosecution as an unfavourable witness pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.  She maintained that the appellant did not douse her with methylated spirits and set her on fire and that the version in the police statement was not the truth even though she believed it was when she provided the statement.  The victim was cross-examined on the contents of her statement and versions of events she had given to the ambulance officer, family and friends.  
The Defence Case
24The appellant's case at trial was that after returning home from the barbeque, he lit a cigar and went upstairs to smoke the cigar on the balcony.  On reaching the balcony door, the appellant found that he could not open it and returned to the bedroom where the victim was sleeping. The appellant leant over the bed to give the victim a kiss before returning downstairs to finish the cigar.  As the appellant walked back up the stairs, he smelt smoke coming from the bedroom and when he reached the bedroom he saw smoke coming out of the bed in which the victim was asleep.  The appellant saw a bottle on the tallboy and thinking it was water, poured it on the bed.  The methylated spirits caught alight and the appellant tried to pat the flame down, causing burns to his hand.  He then grabbed the victim and put her in the shower.  He accidentally stood on the mobile phone as he went to search for burning clothes in the spare room. 
Grounds of Appeal 
25 The appellant appeals on the following grounds:
(1)The judge erred in admitting into evidence the victim's statement to investigating police
(2)A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the use made of the victim's statement to investigating police
(3)A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the use made of evidence disclosing a consciousness of guilt
(4)The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence
Grounds One and Two - Error in Admitting into Evidence the Victim's Statement to Police and Miscarriage of Justice Arising from its Use.
26It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together.  Ground one complains of error in admitting the physical document as an exhibit.  During the hearing of the appeal, contrary to what the appellant appeared to be submitting in writing, the appellant acknowledged that the contents of the statement were relevant and admissible in cross-examination as a prior inconsistent statement.  However, it was submitted that the jury would have given disproportionate weight to the victim's statement in the circumstances of the trial and that a miscarriage of justice thereby arose (Ground two).
27The handwritten notes compiled in the hospital were admitted (without objection) as Exhibit A.  The victim's police statement and the victim's statement of retraction were tendered by the Crown and became Exhibits O and P respectively.  The decision to admit the police statement over objection was made on the basis of the High Court's decision in Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57.  Consideration was not given to the effect of the amendment of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007. 
28At the time of the trial, s 101A of the Evidence Act relevantly provided :-
Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that: (a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or (b) is relevant: (i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and (ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.   29The appellant submitted that the victim's police statement was 'credibility evidence' as defined in s 101A(b) of the Act because it affected the credibility of the victim and was relevant for an inadmissible purpose, namely a hearsay purpose. The appellant maintained that the statement did not fall within an exception to the hearsay rule. In particular, it did not fall within the exception where the maker of the representations was available to give evidence (s 66), because the representations were made for the purpose of indicating the evidence the person would be able to give: s 66(3). 
30The appellant conceded that the representations contained in the statement were admissible as an exception to the credibility rule, since the statement fell within the exception contained in s 103.  It was adduced in cross-examination of the victim by the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to the leave granted under s 38.  It could not be seriously contested that the evidence substantially affected the assessment of the credibility of the victim.  
31In addition, the contents of the statement were admissible pursuant to s 106 as a prior inconsistent statement.  The Crown Prosecutor complied with the requirements of s 106(1) and the victim denied the substance of the evidence, that is, whilst agreeing that she had received burns after she had been doused with methylated spirits which was ignited, she denied any knowledge of how that occurred and that the conduct of the appellant was deliberate : see R v Michael Anthony Ryan (No.7) [2012] NSWSC 1160 ; 218 A Crim R 384.  
32Once the contents of the statement were admissible for a non hearsay purpose, the representations constituted evidence of the facts : s 60.  
33Counsel at trial invoked s 137 of the Evidence Act to justify the exclusion of the victim's police statement, essentially on the same basis as that advanced on the hearing of the appeal, namely, that the jury would apportion too much weight to the statement.  How that consideration constituted a danger of unfair prejudice was not entirely made clear, given that it was never submitted that there was a risk that the jury would misuse the contents of the statement and the exercise required by s 137 is not concerned with the attribution of weight by the tribunal of fact : R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 at [66], [68], [163] - [168].  The contents of the statement were clear and unambiguous.  There was no room for competing inferences arising out of the contents of the statement.  The only conceivable use of the statement was to cast doubt on the reliability of the victim or to prove the commission of the offence.  In either case, it was not relevantly prejudicial.
34The probative value of the statement was considerable if accepted by the jury as a truthful version of events.  It included material that was wholly consistent with forensic evidence at the scene. Significant material included: (1)The victim described being dragged from the bed by the appellant holding onto the waist of her pyjama pants, and tearing them in the process. A torn pyjama drawstring was found close to the bed. The victim could offer no explanation when initially asked about the torn drawstring. She agreed that she could not have been given this information by her family or friends.(2)After the appellant had ripped her pyjama pants the victim got into bed wearing only underpants and a top, which she removed once she was alight. When the ambulance arrived she was only wearing a pair of underpants, consistent with the bottoms being removed at an earlier point in time. (3)The victim described her mobile phone being broken with the flip part being completely broken off, the battery and back cover separated and the sim card missing. This is an accurate description of the mobile phone as shown in the photographs taken at the scene. In evidence, the victim could offer no explanation as to how her telephone came to be broken and in the position as described in her statement. (4)In the statement the victim identified the liquid that was spilt on her as being methylated spirits. In her handwritten statement she only described the appellant as spilling liquid on her and at trial she denied that she had smelt methylated spirits. According to the appellant it would have been quite dark in the bedroom when the appellant entered and poured the methylated spirits on the victim. The victim would not have had the opportunity to see the bottle yet she was able to identify the substance as methylated spirits in her statement. (5)The victim stated that she could hear the sound of a cigarette lighter being operated as she heard the flint contacting the wheel of the light. This is consistent with the sound of a Bic lighter, which was found in the bedroom. According to the appellant, the lighter was in his pocket until after the victim was set alight and only fell from his pocket when he removed his mobile phone to call ""000"". On the victim's evidence and the appellant's version, there was no way that the victim could have been aware that he had taken the lighter from the kitchen to the bedroom. (6)The victim stated that she ran into the spare bedroom and threw the burning pyjama top onto a pile of clothes. This is consistent with the fire damage to the spare room. 
35A submission that the judge erred in admitting the statement must be determined on the basis of the material available at the time of the decision and the reasons that were advanced against its admission, not by a retrospective analysis of what use was made of it and what prominence it may have assumed.  If the evidence was correctly admitted at the time of the ruling, the only remaining question is whether a miscarriage of justice arose from its admission, having regard to other evidence adduced at trial : R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338, [36] - [42] per Simpson J (McCllelan CJ at CL agreeing).  
36No submission was advanced at trial that s 43(2) of the Evidence Act precluded the admission of the statement, on the basis that the victim admitted that she had made a prior inconsistent statement.  That submission was advanced on the hearing of the appeal.  In so far as the victim acknowledged that she had made the statement, but that she was merely relying upon what others had told her, it may be accepted that she was acknowledging that her police statement was inconsistent with her evidence at trial.  However, that does not of itself render the statement inadmissible.  As Barr J explained in R v Aslett [2006] NSWCCA 49 (Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreeing) at [76] :-
[Under the Evidence Act] there is a purpose in tendering such statements beyond any attack on credibility, namely proof of the facts asserted: s60. Nothing in s43 is directed to the admissibility of any prior inconsistent statement to prove the truth of its assertions. All subs(2) does is ensure that a witness who is about to be attacked on credit is fairly dealt with. Nothing in s43 purports to limit the effect of ss38, 103 or 60.
37In my view, there was no error in admitting the statement.  It had very substantial probative value and there was no risk of unfair prejudice.
38The appellant next submitted that admission of the victim's statement as an exhibit gave rise to a risk that it would be given undue weight (Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 542; Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 189 -190).  It was submitted that the risk was heightened by the formal nature as well as the comprehensive and detailed content of the statement.
39The appellant argued that the risk of undue weight had to be assessed in the light of the emphasis given to the exhibit in the Crown Prosecutor's closing address and in the absence of any warning from the judge not to attribute disproportionate weight to the statement.  These factors in combination were said to create a real risk that it would be given disproportionate weight relative to other evidence in the trial (R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 at [11]; Gateley v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 208 at [95]). 
40In my view, this argument is misconceived.  The victim's statement was not the basis of the evidence she gave at trial.  It was not a record of her evidence given at trial.  By admitting the statement as an exhibit, the jury were not given access to a reiteration of her evidence.  To the contrary, the jury were given an entirely different account to that advanced by the victim at trial.  The authorities of NZ and Gately are distinguishable on that basis alone.
41There was no dispute as to the authenticity of the statement : cf Driscoll. The victim agreed that she had signed the document after reading it in order to acknowledge the truth of what had been written.  In Butera, at 198, Dawson J referred to this aspect of Driscoll (that the accused claimed that the record of interview was a fabrication) in determining that the transcript of audio recordings did not attract the same considerations as a document, the veracity of which was disputed.
42The submission that there is a reasonable possibility that the use made of the victim's statement may have affected the jury's verdict, causing a miscarriage of justice ought be rejected.  The discussion in Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59 ; 246 CLR 469 at [53]-[56] and in Lee v R [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [29]-[34] demonstrates that, for the appellant to succeed on ground two, he must establish a causal connection between the admission of the statement and the verdict, in the sense that, but for the admission of the statement, the appellant might have been acquitted.  The principal impediment to success on this ground is that there was no error in admitting the statement and there was other copious evidence originating from the victim of the appellant's deliberate conduct leading to the ignition of the bedclothes.  Exhibit A fell into that category.  In addition, the jury had the advantage of weighing the police statement against the victim's retraction.  
43The trial judge gave appropriate directions, including :-
This case is a little different from many criminal prosecutions brought in these courts. In most cases but certainly not all, an alleged victim of crime provides a police statement, giving his or her version of the offence and will give evidence in the trial, supportive of that version. In the present case, there has been much focus by both parties on the original police statement provided by Ms Scott, by reason of the fact that she has not adhered to that version, in the trial itself. Accordingly the parties have spent a significant part of the trial examining the circumstances in which the initial police statement by Ms Scott was made. The police statement which is exhibit O has been admitted into evidence and you will have it available to you in the course of your considerations. It contains a version of events provided by Ms Scott to police in the 3 to 4 weeks after she suffered injuries. It is a matter for you to assess whether the version then supplied by her is the correct version of events and is reliable. If you consider it to be so, it is open to you to use the contents of that statement as part of the evidence. Perhaps you may think an important part of the evidence, upon which you will determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering whether you accept that the police statement is correct and reliable, you will no doubt have regard to the relevant circumstances in which that statement was made. These include the physical and mental state of Ms Scott when she made the police statement on those three days. The effects of the medication which she had taken on her ability to accurately provide a version of events. Whether or not any of her visitors provided information to her about the alleged events and thus influenced her in her recollection. Whether or not the facts in the police statement were consistent with other accounts she provided to paramedics who attended her and she provided to her family and friends shortly afterwards. The contemporaneous statement she made, those statements at the time about her affection and loyalty towards Mr Col the accused. As well as whether the facts in those statements are consistent with the objective evidence found at the scene. Ladies and gentlemen, these are matters which I suggest you might look at. How you deal with them is a matter for you. Whether you think they are of use is a matter for you but in assessing whether or not you give weight to the statements made by Ms Scott, leading up to her police statement and including it, I suggest that you will need to look and examine those particular issues.It will also be necessary for you to consider the subsequent statement, exhibit P in which Ms Scott provided a version of events suggestive of accident rather than any criminal conduct by the accused. You will of course consider the evidence given in these proceedings and make your own judgements about the accuracy and reliability of the evidence. 
44Defence counsel did not request any further directions at the end of the Summing Up.  The absence of a warning from the trial judge against attributing too much weight to the statement was not necessary and was not sought.  Rule 4 applies.
45Disregarding the victim's statement, the accounts given by the victim to medical personnel, members of her family and friends, Exhibit A and the objective evidence in combination amounted to a strong Crown case.  The retraction by the victim only four days before the commencement of the trial and the victim's evidence at trial did very little to undermine it. 
46 I would dismiss grounds one and two.
Ground Three : Miscarriage of Justice Arising from Consciousness of Guilt Evidence.
47This ground is focussed upon two pieces of evidence in the trial, namely, the appellant's attempts to dissuade the victim from telling the ambulance personnel and police ""what happened"" and the appellant's account of how he came to move the bottle of methylated spirits onto the rear of the upper shelf of the walk in wardrobe, after the ambulance arrived.
48The recording of the ""000"" call was Exhibit L at trial.  The terms of the recorded conversation that are the subject of this ground are set out at [9] above.
49In the course of examination in chief, the appellant said that he did not remember what he said during the ""000"" call.  In cross-examination, the text of the recorded statements was put to the appellant and he continued to claim that he had no memory of those words.  He did not deny saying them.  The Crown Prosecutor put to the appellant that he was ""concerned that [he] had done something very wrong [and] concerned that [the victim not] say anything to the police about what [he] had done to cause that situation.""  The appellant refuted those suggestions.  
50In the course of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address, he said :-
If ...  this was some inadvertent accident where there hadn't been any sort of domestic fighting beforehand, there hadn't been any dragging down the stairs or anything like that, and he simply came to the rescue or the aid of Ms Scott, why on earth would he be saying, ""don't tell the cops please"". He would have a perfectly reasonable explanation as to him having made a mistake in terms of tipping - it is a matter for you whether it is a reasonable explanation - as to tipping methylated spirits over her thinking it was water. I ask you to examine that, members of the jury, that whole scenario. Does it ring true to you members of the jury, this suggestion and the accused's evidence that he grabbed this bottle thinking it was a bottle of water and then poured it on the already ignited it seems, Mary Anne Scott or the bed............................................................................If the accused had done nothing wrong, why is she not going to say anything, and why is he saying, ""don't say what happened"".
51In the closing address of the appellant's counsel, it was submitted that the appellant's entreaty to the victim not to ""tell the cops"" was explicable by the fact that the appellant had made a terrible mistake throwing methylated spirits on the victim and that ""he was afraid about how it might look.""  
52Exhibit K at trial consisted of four photographs, three of which depicted the empty bottle of methylated spirits at the rear of an upper shelf in the walk-in wardrobe of the bedroom occupied by the appellant and Ms Scott.  The fourth photograph was a close-up view of the label on the bottle of methylated spirits.  The exhibit was tendered during the Crown's cross-examination of the victim.  The victim identified the bottle in the photograph as the relevant bottle of methylated spirits and denied any knowledge of how it came to be in that position in the wardrobe.
53During cross-examination of the appellant, he was asked if he had placed the bottle on the upper shelf of the wardrobe.  The appellant claimed that after the ambulance had arrived at the property, he returned inside the house because he did not have his keys or wallet, that he found his keys but not his wallet and so he returned upstairs, came across the bottle as he did so, picked it up, ""didn't really think much of it and ... just tossed it.""
54The appellant further acknowledged in cross-examination that he had looked at the label and read ""methylated spirits"" before throwing the bottle into the wardrobe and at the time that he did so, he had already come to the realisation that it was methylated spirits that he had poured on to the victim.  The Crown Prosecutor put the allegation to the appellant that he had deliberately poured methylated spirits onto the bed clothes and set the bed alight, after an argument with the victim.  The Crown Prosecutor then suggested to the appellant that ""the reason why the methylated spirits bottle was in the upper shelf of the walk-in wardrobe area was because you realised that that was implicating you in having done precisely what I've just been putting to you?""  The appellant denied that suggestion.
55During the Crown's closing address, the Crown Prosecutor suggested that the appellant was ""trying to hide the evidence by putting [the bottle] where he did.""  After the address, the submission made to the jury with respect to the methylated spirits bottle was clarified between the Crown Prosecutor, the appellant's counsel and the trial judge.  The Crown maintained that it was available to the jury to draw the inference that the appellant consciously attempted to hide the methylated spirits bottle.  The appellant's counsel agreed that the inference was available and did not require any correction, beyond a request that the trial judge read the questions and answers to the jury.  Ultimately, that was what the trial judge did. In addition, the trial judge said :-
I should say at this point that Mr Crown in his submissions made the submission that the reason that the accused threw the bottle away was that he was hiding evidence. It is certainly true that no such specific proposition was put to Mr Col to allow him to answer it. The Crown as I apprehended, intended that to be a submission as an inference that you could draw from the facts and the evidence that he would rely upon, as I understand it, is the passage I have just read to you.
56In short, the principal use which was made of the ""000"" call and the appellant's conduct with respect to the methylated spirits bottle was to rebut the alternative explanation advanced by the defence, namely that of accident, in response to a circumstantial Crown case.  The judge confirmed the basis of the Crown case in the summing up.  After giving an unexceptional direction to the jury about the drawing of inferences and the importance of excluding other reasonable alternatives, the judge said :-
How does that apply in the present case? In the present case the Crown asks you to draw an inference that given the presence, the location and condition of various physical exhibits, the second written statement of Ms Scott, the handwritten one, the evidence of the accused cannot be the true position. He points to the presence of the methylated spirits bottle in the bedroom. He points to the presence of the cap of that bottle on the bed, to the presence of the mobile phone in a broken state near the bed, the unexplained absence of the SIM card to that phone, of the ultimate and unexplained location of the metho bottle in the wardrobe, why it got there, and as to the presence of the torn pyjama cord near the bed where Ms Scott was originally lying.The accused argues as against those that there are other reasonable explanations for those matters which are not consistent with the guilt of the accused. His counsel contends that the damage to the phone could equally have been caused, as the accused said in evidence, by his stepping on the phone in the aftermath of the fire, that the other damage to the pyjama cord and the like could have occurred in the subsequent chaos when the fire went out of control, that the metho bottle and its presence in the bedroom had a perfectly rational explanation, namely it had been used the night before for the purpose of assisting the accused administer steroids, that the lighter and its presence in the bedroom was explained by the fact that it had been in the accused's pocket and dropped out of his pocket as he reached in to use the phone to call 000 and that the initial fire in the bed may have been caused by his dropping parts of a lit cigar onto the bed.So ladies and gentlemen, when you consider what inferences you draw from the physical facts, you will weigh up all of those and you will say to yourself ""well, is the conclusion that the Crown asks me to draw the only rational and reasonable conclusion or is what the accused says and his counsel on his behalf argued, a reasonable alternative.""
57The appellant submits that, to the extent that the cross-examination of the appellant and the Crown Prosecutor's submissions suggested that the appellant's words and conduct amounted to a consciousness of guilt, a direction such as that discussed in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28 ; 200 CLR 234 ought to have been given.  
58In Zoneff, the accused was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor in terms that suggested he told a number of lies both in and out of court, but because the accused was self represented, there was no Crown address.  An incomplete and unsatisfactory Edwards direction (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193) was given by the trial judge, in circumstances where the issue of lies could only have gone to the credit of the accused.  It was against that background that the High Court suggested the following direction :-
You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.
59There are three limbs to the direction.  The first is that it is a matter of fact for the jury to determine whether deliberate lies were told.  The second is it is a matter for the jury what significance they attach to those lies.  The third is a warning not to reason directly from an adverse finding on the credibility of the accused to guilt of the offence.
60In this case, it was not directly alleged that the appellant had told lies or was telling lies in the course of his evidence.  It may be accepted that the appellant's credibility was in issue to the extent that the Crown case was that his account of the accidental ignition of the bedclothes was not worthy of belief.  However, there could be no risk that the jury would reason directly towards guilt from an acceptance that the appellant tried to silence the victim or that he had tried to hide incriminating evidence.  The jury were instructed that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt unless they were able to reject the appellant's explanation as a reasonably available one, and only after the appellant's conduct (which was not disputed) was taken together with all the other evidence on which the Crown relied.  
61A Zoneff direction was neither required nor desirable in the circumstances of this case.   There was no risk of a misunderstanding on the jury's part as to the use to which they might put the appellant's conduct.  It was not submitted at trial or on the hearing of the appeal that the appellant's conduct was incapable of supporting an inference of guilt.  More importantly, the directions of the judge conformed to the spirit of what was said in R v Heyde (1990) NSWLR 234 at 244, namely, provided that it is open to the jury to rationally draw an inference that consciousness of guilt motivated the relevant conduct on the part of the accused, the jury should be directed that such an inference cannot be drawn unless other reasonable explanations for the conduct inconsistent with a consciousness of guilt have been excluded. 
62Rule 4 applies to this ground.  I would refuse leave to rely upon it.
Ground Four : Unreasonable Verdict
63The appellant submits that on the whole of the evidence at trial, there remains the reasonable possibility that the appellant did not deliberately set the victim alight and that, in all of the circumstances, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant caused grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. 
64On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant acknowledged that it was open to the jury to reject the appellant's account in evidence at trial, as well as his prior accounts to treating medical practitioners and the evidence of the victim at trial, to the effect that the incident was in the nature of an accident.  The appellant also acknowledges that his explanation for the incident, which was effectively adopted by the victim, was inconsistent with objectively reliable evidence and inconsistent with his representations before trial.
65It is not suggested that an outright acquittal is appropriate, rather that the Court should enter a substituted verdict for the alternative offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm.  Whilst acknowledging that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant deliberately threw a volatile liquid onto the bed, in the knowledge that the victim was in the bed, and that the act of flicking the lighter was deliberate, the appellant nonetheless maintained that it was equally open as an inference that the appellant either did not deliberately light the fire or, if he deliberately lit the fire, that he did not intend to set the victim alight.  In other words, accepting that the appellant had been violent towards the victim, that she had retreated to the bedroom, that he said ""you are not sleeping in the bed tonight"", that he went downstairs, retrieved the lighter and methylated spirits from the kitchen cupboard, returned to the bedroom, doused the bed with methylated spirits, uttered the threat that he would burn the bed or the house down, then deliberately flicked the lighter (one or more times from the foot of the bed), it was nonetheless a reasonably available inference that the appellant intended no more than to tease or taunt the victim.
66Having examined the whole of the evidence at trial, I am of the view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally caused grievous bodily harm to the victim.  In coming to that conclusion, I have not disregarded the fact that the victim told a number of her friends whilst in hospital that the appellant ""did not mean it"", that the appellant said ""Oh fuck"" when the fire took hold on the bedclothes and that the appellant immediately grabbed the victim and took her into the shower.  Nor have I disregarded the obvious distress on the part of the appellant in the course of the ""000"" calls and statements to the effect that he did not mean to harm the victim.
67The test for an unreasonable verdict or one that cannot be supported having regard to the evidence is not satisfied by demonstrating that the jury might have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt : Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30 ; 230 CLR 559 at [113] ; Lee v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [200] - [202].  The evidence ""did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt"" : Libke at [113].  
68The evidence that the appellant expressed his intention to ""burn it all down"" shortly before dousing the bed with methylated spirits, and that he deliberately flicked the lighter, after the victim had knelt in the bed and asked him what he was doing, provided a compelling basis for the jury's verdict, notwithstanding any expressions of regret that followed upon the appellant's realisation of what he had done.  There was no necessary inconsistency, in my view, between the appellant taunting the victim and then making good the threat.  The jury was required to infer from the appellant's words and conduct that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim, at the time that he deliberately flicked the lighter.  Even if that intention was of a transitory nature, it was sufficient for the purposes of the offence.  It was open to the jury to conclude that that was the only reasonably available inference.  
69I would dismiss this ground.
70I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.
71ROTHMAN J : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Latham J and the orders she proposes.  I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed.  I wish to add some short further comment on the ground of appeal based on an ""unreasonable verdict"".
72The test for an unreasonable verdict is whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, at [14].  The Court is required to make an ""independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"".
73In accordance with that requirement, I have read the evidence and independently assessed whether a reasonable doubt exists.  It is always theoretically possible that someone or something that sounds plausible and believable is inaccurate or wrong.  It is theoretically possible that a person, who sounds truthful, is in fact being untruthful or inaccurate.  It is for that reason that the High Court, in stating the test to be applied, remarked that the Court ""must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses"": M v The Queen, at 493.
74Essentially, the Crown case depends on the truth of accounts given by the victim, otherwise than in evidence, to a range of persons, and inferences arising therefrom.  Those earlier extra-curial statements are believable, generally consistent with each other such statement, and also consistent with the independent evidence.
75Further, as is clear from the analysis of Latham J, the alternative view is in some significant respects inconsistent with all of the earlier statements, and with the independent evidence.  The jury were in a better position than are we to assess the demeanour of the witnesses.  Nevertheless, the whole of the evidence does not, in my view, raise a doubt of the requisite kind and, to the extent one can rely on transcript for this purpose, is consistent with the truth of the earlier extra-curial statements by the victim.
76I have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.  Many cases depend on the jury accepting one version of events and rejecting another; sometimes from one witness.  There was a proper basis on which the jury could reject the innocent explanation, and a proper basis for accepting, to the requisite standard, that version, which established guilt.
77The circumstance that one version in evidence ""is accepted and another ... rejected, of itself, and without independent evidence or some other factor affecting that assessment, cannot be a basis upon which a jury verdict is necessarily rendered unreasonable"": Brendon Singh v R [2011] NSWCCA 100 at [132].  In this case, I agree with the jury's assessment.  At the very least, the ""jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving ... [any] ... doubt"" that might otherwise be experienced (M v The Queen, at 494-495).  There has been no miscarriage of justice.
78DAVIES J : I agree with Latham J.

       INTRODUCTION 
        
       By separate proceedings heard together in the Land and Environment Court before Sheahan J, both Appellants Glen Rex Gilmour and a company owned by him and his wife, Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited, were each convicted of an offence under s16 of the  
       Clean Waters Act 
        1970 (NSW).  
        
       
     2 Sheahan J concluded that the facts as he considered proven constituted a breach on 17 February 1999 of what are the now repealed Clean Waters Provisions of the regime within the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 (NSW) and in particular under s8B of that Act whereby what are described as tier 2 offences find their sanction.  
      
       
     3 Section 8B is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “8B. Offences under the Clean Waters Act 1970  
          
          
           
           (1) Any person who (by virtue of any provision of the  
           Clean Waters Act 
            1970) is guilty of an offence against this Act is liable:  
            
             
             (a) in the case of a corporation---to a penalty not exceeding $125,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty not exceeding $60,000 for each day the offence continues, or  
             (b) in the case of an individual---to a penalty not exceeding $60,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty not exceeding $30,000 for each day the offence continues.  
             
            
           
          
          
           
           (2) Any person who (by virtue of any provision of the  
           Clean Waters Act 
            1970) is guilty of an offence specified in Part 2 of Schedule 1 is liable to a penalty not exceeding the amount specified in that Part in respect of that offence and is not liable to any penalty under subsection (1). If the Schedule indicates that the maximum penalty varies according to whether the offender is an individual or a corporation, the penalty is to be imposed accordingly.  
           
          
          
           
           (3) A regulation under the  
           Clean Waters Act 
            1970 may impose a penalty not exceeding:  
            
             
             (a) $10,000 in the case of an individual, or  
             (b) $20,000 in the case of a corporation,  
             in respect of a contravention of the regulation. “ 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
       
     4 It should be noted that the relevant offences arise under sub-s (1) of s8B involved a maximum penalty for a company of $125,000 and a maximum penalty for an individual of $60,000 with further provision for continuing offences.  
      
       
     5 On 24 September 2001 each of the Appellants was fined $6,000 and ordered to pay the costs of the Prosecutor determined by agreement, or if no such agreement could be reached, in accordance with the Regulations.  
      
       
     6 The place where the alleged pollution occurred is near Yarrowyck in the waters of the Gwydir River. The Prosecutor alleged that, in the period Monday 15 February 1999 to Wednesday 17 February 1999, the Defendant Mr Gilmour, on behalf of the Defendant Company, applied fertiliser from a light plane, registered call sign VH-CCH, to the paddocks of their rural property, “Myanbah”, near the Gwydir River, and that, on Wednesday 17 February 1999, during the course of the aerial application of fertiliser, pellets of fertiliser, dropped from the plane, entered the river, and landed immediately adjacent to it, thereby polluting it, in breach of s16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. Both Appellants, as defendants, entered pleas of not guilty on 26 April 2000.  
      
       
     7 There was no contest about the Appellant company’s ownership of the relevant plane. Nor was there any contest that the Appellants Mr Gilmour, and his wife, Bridget Mary Gilmour, had been, since 1991, and were at the relevant time, the only shareholders and directors of the Defendant company, and both were employed by it, with the Defendant Mr Gilmour employed as the pilot.  
      
       
     8 “Myanbah” is a grazing property of some 5,000 acres, west of the Gwydir River, owned since 1980 by Mr John Pierce.  
      
       
     9 Between the fence and the eastern boundary of “Myanbah” and the river itself is a vegetated strip of land, approximately 100 metres wide, known as a “flood run”. On the eastern side of the river is a property known as “Dwindlestone”, owned, for the last sixteen years, and occupied by the last twelve years, by EPA Officer Riki Davidson. Ms Davidson’s house on that property is located approximately 400m east of the river and her fence is about 80m from it. To the south of Ms Davidson’s land, one property away, is another rural property, owned by Norman Austin of Toowoomba, since October 1988.  
      
       
     10 Each of Austin, Pierce and Davidson gave evidence at the hearing.  
      
       
        
       The relevant statutory provisions start with s16(1) which provides that “A person shall not pollute any waters”. 
        
        
       Section 16(2) is a ‘deeming’ provision in the following terms: 
        
         
         “(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be deemed to pollute waters if:  
          
           
           (a) the person places any matter (whether solid, liquid or gaseous) in a position where:  
            
             
             (i) it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates, or  
             (ii) it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate, into any waters, on to the dry bed of any waters, or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or causes or permits any such matter to be placed in such a position, or  
             
            
           (b) the person places any such matter on the dry bed of any waters, or in any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or causes or permits any such matter to be placed on such a dry bed or in such a drain, channel or gutter,  
           and the matter would, had it been placed in any waters have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       Section 5 of the CW Act defines ‘pollute, in relation to any waters’, to mean:  
        
         
         “(a) to place in or on, or otherwise introduce into or on to, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, so that the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed, or  
         …  
         (c) to place in or on, or otherwise introduce into or on to, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, that is of a prescribed nature, description or class or that does not comply with any standard prescribed in respect of that matter,”  
          
           
          
         
        
       [The prosecutor relies on (a) and (c), but not on (b)] 
        
       
     11 The prosecutor also relies on the following relevant definitions in s5 of the CW Act: 
      
       
        
         
         ""premises"" 
          includes place, ship, boat and any other vessel whatsoever.  
         ""wastes"" means any solid, gas or liquid, with or without matter in suspension or solution in it, which is or may be discharged from premises:  
         (a) in the course of any process or operation carried on in connection with any mine (within the meaning of the Mines Inspection Act 1901 or the Coal Mines Regulation Act 1982), open cut working (within the meaning of the latter Act), coal washing, trade, industry, agriculture or sewage treatment, or  
         (b) in the course of any domestic process or operation,  
         or which is in, or is or may be discharged from, any waste disposal depot.  
         ""waters"" means any river, stream, lake, lagoon, swamp, wetlands, unconfined surface water, natural or artificial watercourse, dam or tidal waters (including the sea), or part thereof, and includes water stored in artificial works, water in water mains, water pipes and water channels, and any underground or artesian water, or any part thereof. 
         
        
       
     12 The prosecutor also relies on the following provisions of the Clean Waters Regulation 1972: 
      
       
        
         
         “2(2) The following matter is prescribed as matter for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of ‘pollute’ in section 5 of the Act: 
          
           
           (a) without limiting the generality of paragraph (b), wastes - 
            
             
             ….. 
             (vi) containing any phosphorus compound 
             ….. 
             
            
           (b) any matter of the following nature: 
            
             
             ….. 
             (iii) inorganic matter of any description including ashes, ballast, soil, earth, mud, stones, sand, clay residue or washings from any mineral processing or extractive operation or soil, spoil or washings from any dredging operation;  
             ….. 
             (viii) chemicals or poisonous substances of any description; …” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     13 The factual circumstances concerning the fertiliser spreading operation is set out in the fifth judgment of Sheahan J. So too is the evidence as viewed by the Trial Judge regarding the various “Appellants” as also the Trial Judge’s assessment of the expert scientific evidence and his conclusions as to the question of pollution and the cases against the two defendants; see judgment of 15 June 2001, para 17 and following. For the purposes of the present appeal it is not necessary to deal with this evidence in extenso save as is material to the appeal grounds. It is to those I now turn.  
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL AND SCOPE 
       
     14 The Grounds of Appeal are set out below (ground 2 has since been abandoned):  
      
       
        
         
         GROUNDS OF APPEAL ON CONVICTION 
          
         1. The learned Trial Judge erred in admitting and relying on the evidence of Mrs Bridget Gilmour.  
         
        
        
         
         2. The learned Trial Judge erred in relying on the evidence of Mr Pierce. [abandoned on appeal].  
         
        
        
         
         3. The learned Trial Judge erred by not excluding the results of the testing by the Environment Protection Authority.  
         
        
        
         
         4. The learned Trial Judge erred in interpreting the provisions of the Clean Waters Regulation 1972.  
         
        
        
         
         5. The learned Trial Judge erred in failing to provide reasons for dismissing the reasonable hypothesis advanced by the defendant.  
         
        
        
         
         6. That the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory.  
         
        
        
         
         GROUNDS OF APPEAL ON SENTENCE 
          
         7. The learned Trial Judge erred in holding that 700 grams of phosphorus had entered the river which was against the weight of the evidence.  
         
        
        
         
         8. The learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the defendant should have exercised more care which was against the evidence before the Court.  
         
        
        
         
         9. The learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the offence was at the maximum end of the lowest end of the range of penalties.  
         
        
        
         
         10. The learned Trial Judge erred in imposing a fine that was not in keeping with the notion of parity between this defendant and the co-defendant Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited.  
         
        
        
       
     15 The appeal lies by the combined operation of ss5AA and 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (“the Act”). Prior to those amendments made by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2000 (NSW) such an appeal was by way of re-hearing on the evidence before the trial court, subject to fresh, additional or substituted evidence by leave: see Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683. The amendments omitted sub-ss(3) and (3A) of s5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act, which had provided for an appeal of that nature. In the light of the observations of the court in Histollo Pty Ltd v Director General of National Parks and Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661, which clearly enough brought about the amendment. It was intended that an appeal under s5AA become an appeal of the same nature as that for which s5 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides, described in Histollo Pty Ltd v Director General of National Parks and Wildlife Service as an appeal “in the strict sense”; see Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority (2001) 115 LGERA 304 at 306 per Giles JA.  
      
       
     16 It is convenient that I deal at the outset with a threshold question. It is whether, under these amended appeal provisions, the Court may dismiss an appeal, despite an error at trial having been established, on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. That would parallel the effect of the express proviso to that effect which still appears in the immediately following s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act; s6(1) pre-dates the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2000 (NSW) and the amendments introduced thereby. The latter applies to a person exercising a right of appeal under s5(1) of that Act, who has been convicted on indictment. That is to be compared to a s5AA appeal, which arises in criminal cases dealt with by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction.  
      
       
     17 I therefore set out first s5AA, omitting the repealed sub-ss (3) and (3A) and then to be compared, s6(1) of that Act.  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         5AA. Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction  
         (1) A person:  
          
           
           (a) convicted of an offence, or  
           (b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made,  
           by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order.  
           
          
         (2) For the purpose of this Act, a person acquitted on the ground of mental illness, where mental illness was not set up as a defence by the person, shall be deemed to be a person convicted, and any order to keep the person in custody shall be deemed to be a sentence.  
         (3), (3A) (Repealed)  
         (4) The Court of Criminal Appeal, in proceedings before it on an appeal under this section, may confirm the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction or may order that the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction be vacated and make any determination that the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction could have made on the evidence heard on appeal.  
         (5) Section 7 (4) applies to an appellant on an appeal under subsection (1) in the same way as it applies to an appellant on an appeal under section 5 (1).  
         (6) Provisions shall be made by rules of court for detaining an appellant on an appeal under subsection (1) who has been sentenced to imprisonment until the appeal has been determined, or for ordering the appellant into any former custody.”  
         
        
        
         
         “ 
         6. Determination of appeals in ordinary cases  
         (1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.”  
         
        
       
     18 The question arises because there is no equivalent to the express proviso in s6(1), to be found in s5AA(4). However, the question whether the proviso applied to appeals under s5AA and s5AB did not arise, while the appeals were by way of hearings. It is only now a live question, given the conversion of those appeals from re-hearings into strict appeals, by the amendments made pursuant to the Courts Legislation Amendment Act in 2000.  
      
       
     19 I have already referred to Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority as dealing with these sections, to which should be added Thornloe v Filipowski (2001) 52 NSWLR 60 at 63 per Spigelman CJ. Each of those decisions confirmed that appeals of this nature are now appeals “in the strict sense”. This means that error must be demonstrated as a threshold point. Neither decision considers the question of whether the proviso in s6(1) is to be read into s5AA(4). This was understandable given that the first case, Cabonne, was purely an appeal on sentence and the other (Thornloe) was an appeal as to the exercise of discretion under s10 of the Crimes Sentencing (Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  
      
       
     20 Clearly enough, s5AA(4), in confining appeals to appeals in the strict sense, distinct from a full re-hearing, conferred a discretion on the Court of Criminal Appeal, by use of the word “may”. That discretion was either to confirm the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction or, to “order that the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction be vacated”. In doing the latter, the Supreme Court may “make any determination that the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction could have made on the evidence heard on appeal”.  
      
       
     21 The discretion is thus stated at large. It omits the express proviso in the earlier unaltered s6(1) for determination of appeals in what are described as “ordinary cases”, that is on indictment. It is only that omission which gives rise to the argument that the maxim expressio unius applies. That is to say, the express inclusion of the proviso in s6(1) read with the subsequently amended s5AA(4) which could have, but did not, incorporate a similar such proviso, leads to the result that the appeal in summary cases does not confer any discretion to dismiss the appeal where, though appealable error has occurred, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  
      
       
     22 Such an interpretation is difficult to reconcile with the reasoning of the High Court in R v Conway (2002) 186 ALR 328. There, the High Court was dealing with s28(1)(f) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). It permits the Federal Court to grant a new trial “on any ground upon which it is appropriate to grant a new trial”, though there is no equivalent to the contiguous s6AA. It likewise omits an express proviso whereby the court may dismiss an appeal on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. The majority of the High Court (Gaudron ACJ, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ, with Kirby J reaching the same outcome but by different reasoning) found that the combination of the word “appropriate”, with the long-established common law, meant that s28(1)(f) incorporated the effect of such a proviso by inference.  
      
       
     23 The Respondent did not press paras 10 and 11 of its written submissions but instead pressed only that in para 12. I quote those written submissions below:  
      
       
        
         
         “10. Nevertheless, application of the majority decision in  
         Conway 
          would permit, if not require, the Court to rely heavily on the history and purpose of the proviso in construing s5AA(4). If the construction of s5AA(4) is approached in that manner, it would be open to infer the operation of the proviso within the broad powers of the Court under s5AA(4). In particular, the power of the Court under 5AA(4) ‘ 
         to confirm the determination made by the trial 
          [trial court]” is not restricted to circumstances where no error has been established, so it could be read as incorporating the proviso. In other words, even if error is established, the Court may in any event confirm the determination made by the trial court to convict. 
         
        
        
         
         11. In light of  
         Conway 
         , a finding that the proviso operates within s5AA(4) would pay due regard to the fact that the amendments made by the  
         Courts Legislation Amendment Act 
          2000 were in response to the recommendations of the Court.8 The operation of the proviso for appeals against convictions for indictable offences, but not for appeals against conviction for summary offences, would be the kind of anomaly which the Court identified in  
         Histollo 
          in recommending the amendments.9  
         
        
        
         
         12. If the Court is not satisfied that the proviso applies to appeals under ss5AA and 5AB of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
         , it is nevertheless open to the Court to exercise its power to dismiss the appeal and confirm the determination made by the Land and Environment Court (sub-s5AA(4)) on the ground that his Honour’s error could not, on any reasonable hypothesis, have influenced the result ( 
         Conway v The Queen 
          (2002) 186 ALR 328 per Kirby J at [76] and [80]).”

     24 The distinction between the reasoning of Gaudron ACJ, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ on the one hand and Kirby J on the other, is that while each have resort to the long-established common law rule reflected in the earlier-mentioned proviso, Kirby J eschewed the implication of any proviso. Rather, his reasoning is based upon the proposition that, “any dismissal of the appeal in the face of a misdirection at trial is controlled by the general rule that a court may dismiss an appeal if the error could not, on any reasonable hypothesis, have influenced the result”; see para [80] at 349, citing Stokes v R (1960) 105 CLR 279 at 284-5.  
      
       
     25 The reasoning of Gaudron ACJ, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ is rather derived from giving content to what is an “appropriate” ground for granting a new trial by reference to the same long-established principle of the common law; see para [5] to [6] at 330 in particular, as well as the historical exegesis which follows.  
      
       
     26 Thus the supposed contrast between this approach and that of Kirby J is less sharp than first appears. Both reach the same conclusion by resort to the same common law rule, the larger majority treating that as a basis for construing the statute, whilst Kirby J treats the statute as still permitting recourse to the common law rule.  
      
       
     27 I do not consider that the express inclusion of the proviso in s6(1) of the Act should lead to a different result. Section 6(1), and s5AA in its current form, were clearly enacted at different times. The draftsman of s5AA(4) was content to confer a discretion upon the Court of Appeal whose content can be derived from the same common law rule as has long been an essential part of the common law in relation to appeals. It is a rule that, as Kirby J put it, “an appellate court would not exercise its powers to set aside a valid judgment (criminal or civil) for immaterial, irrelevant or insubstantial reasons”, these being exemplified by error where “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”; para [76] at 348.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     28 The Court of Criminal Appeal, in these appeal proceedings from a determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction, may dismiss an appeal, despite an appealable error at trial having been established, on being satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  
      
       
        
       Ground 1 - The learned Trial Judge erred in admitting and relying on the evidence of Mrs Bridget Gilmour. 
       
     29 Various bases were advanced by the Appellants for appealable error having occurred in admitting and relying on the evidence of Mrs Gilmour. To put those arguments in perspective, it is necessary to explain how her evidence was received and the nature of that evidence. It will be recalled that Mrs Gilmour was the spouse of the Defendant, Mr Gilmour, and one of the two directors of the corporate Defendant, Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited, the other director being the Defendant Mr Gilmour. Mr and Mrs Gilmour owned the shares in Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited equally.  
      
       
     30 On day 3 of the trial (21 December 2000), the Prosecutor made an application in the proceedings against Mr Gilmour to call Mrs Gilmour as a witness, having earlier required her to attend by subpoena dated 17 December 2000. This was to give evidence as to the identity of the pilot of the aircraft which carried out the aerial fertilising. Counsel for Mr Gilmour and the company, opposed the application. The Trial Judge took it that “Mrs Gilmour is reluctant to comply”; see para [10] of the judgment handed down in relation to that application by the Prosecutor dated 22 December 2000.  
      
       
     31 That judgment records the sequence of events. These include, relevantly, that in late June 2000 Bignold J in Environmental Protection Authority v Gilmore & Another (2000) 109 LGERA 228 had earlier extended the time, which had been set for further prosecution evidence to be filed, to 5 June 2000. Six additional affidavits were, as a result, accepted by the court. The hearing dates were subsequently vacated. On 3 October, 2000, 14 to 15 December 2000 were fixed for the trial (which subsequently took nine days). Thus the application was made on the fourth hearing day, still in the Prosecutor’s case, where earlier prosecution witnesses had given their evidence but the Defendants had still to give their evidence.  
      
       
     32 On 8 December 2000 the Trial Judge as Duty Judge, records that he dealt with a dispute between the Prosecutor and the Defendant company regarding compliance with the subpoena issued by the Prosecutor. This was for the production of documents upon which the Prosecutor hoped to rely to prove that Mr Gilmour was flying the plane over the relevant property. He records that Mrs Gilmour gave evidence on behalf of the company on that occasion, to the effect that the relevant civil aviation regulations did not result in the relevant documents being available to the company for production.  
      
       
     33 Significantly, according to the Appellants, the judge states that the Prosecutor has now applied, under s18 of the Evidence Act 1995, to call Mrs Gilmour as witness in the case against her husband”; see para [9] of the judgment AB, 488. Section 18 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         18. Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally  
          
          
         (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding.  
          
          
         (2) A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required:  
          
           
           (a) to give evidence, or  
           (b) to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant,  
           as a witness for the prosecution.  
           
          
          
         (3) The objection is to be made before the person gives the evidence or as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the right so to object, whichever is the later.  
          
          
         (4) If it appears to the court that a person may have a right to make an objection under this section, the court is to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of this section as it may apply to the person.  
          
          
         (5) …..  
          
          
         (6) A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that:  
          
           
           (a) there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence, and  
           (b) the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.  
           
          
          
         (7) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:  
          
           
           (a) the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,  
           (b) the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,  
           (c) whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,  
           (d) the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,  
           (e) whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (8) ….. “ 
         
        
       
     34 The Trial Judge stated his reasons for acceding to the Prosecutor’s application. This was in terms which indicated that he was necessarily dealing with both the Prosecutor’s application for leave to adduce further evidence by calling Mrs Gilmour as a witness and, of necessity, the subpoena that initiated that process. He did so, according to the Appellants, erroneously, in wrongly invoking s18 of the Evidence Act. Reliance is placed by the Appellant on the quoted passage from the judgment below, as betraying appealable error.  
      
       
        
         
         “11. These are serious proceedings and are so regarded by both sides, the general community, and the court. They are matters of substantial public importance. 
         
        
        
         
         12. The defendants have undeniable rights, and are exercising them, in their current situation, but so does the prosecution. 
         
        
        
         
         13. Bignold J makes that point in par 37 of his judgment, to which Mr Baird draws attention.  
         
        
        
         
         14. The issue at the core of the prosecutor’s application is, as Mr Howard says (in par 16 of his written submissions), ‘ 
         important, indeed … critical’. 
          Mrs Gilmour’s evidence would carry considerable weight, not least because  
         no 
          ‘ 
         other evidence is reasonably available to the Prosecution in this issue 
         ’, even though there are relevant admissions in the company’s case, which are not admissible against Mr Gilmour.  
         
        
        
         
         15. Not only that, but another witness, expected to identify Gilmour as the pilot at the relevant time, failed to give the evidence expected of him when he testified on 15 December. Indeed he swore to the presence, at the airport, on at least one day of the operation, of another person.  
         
        
        
         
         16. The business relationship, and the personal relationship, between Mr & Mrs Gilmour are involved here, but the information sought by the prosecutor is correctly described by Mr Howard (par 24 of his written submissions) as ‘ 
         routine 
         ’, in the operations of a company engaged in the rural aviation industry.  
         
        
        
         
         17. The relevant provisions of s18 appear to me, therefore, to be satisfied on the evidence before me.  
         
        
        
         
         18. It is regrettable that such situations arise while trials are running, despite the best efforts of the Rules, and of the court, to ensure that defendants in class 5 proceedings are  
         fully 
          apprised of the evidence to be led against them.  
         
        
        
         
         19. This is a most unusual situation, given the events of 8 and 15 December, and the court simply has to deal with it as it has arisen, regardless of the defence’s cry that the prosecutor should have been more thorough in its investigation and preparation.  
         
        
        
         
         20. I have, accordingly, decided to accede to the prosecutor’s application for leave to adduce further evidence by calling Mrs Gilmour as a witness in the prosecution case. I am fortified in that conclusion by the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in  
         R v Glasby 
          [2000] NSWCCA 83.”  
         
        
       
     35 Before I deal with the judgment in the context of this appeal ground, I should note that on taking the stand, and having had explained by the Court the questions of compellability, Mrs Gilmour agreed to give the evidence and not claim any right to be silent. She thus did not herself invoke s18 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
     36 The Appellants’ objection to receiving the evidence of Mrs Gilmour was on a number of different bases relied upon both individually and it can be assumed, collectively. These I shall attempt to summarise below:  
      
       
       (a) the correct procedure was departed from in that the court should first have determined whether the Prosecutor should have been allowed to call on the subpoena and only then to consider whether Mrs Gilmour was a compellable witness under s18 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       ;  
       (b) the court should have excluded the evidence under the mandatory provisions of s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), on the basis that its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value; and  
       (c) the Trial Judge wrongly invoked s18 of the Evidence Act as the basis for the Prosecutor’s application and wrongly dealt with it in his judgment of 22 December 2000.  
       
     37 One important matter should be stated at the outset. While clearly enough the Appellants objected to the Prosecutor being allowed to call on the subpoena, thereby to obtain the evidence of Mrs Gilmour, the Appellants did not seek an adjournment when that application was refused nor indeed beforehand.  
      
       
     38 Self-evidently, had the Appellants’ prejudice consisted of the need to assess the late evidence of Mrs Gilmour and there were a genuine need for further time to do so in relation to the preparation of the defence case, such an application could and should have been made at the time and may have had some prospects of success.  
      
       
     39 Moreover, it could not be said that the evidence of Mrs Gilmour was likely to have occasioned surprise to the defence. This is because, though the admission of Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited could not be used against its director Mr Gilmour, it would be artificial in the extreme not to recognise, but so far only as surprise is concerned, that Mrs Gilmour on its behalf admitted that Mr Gilmour was the person who piloted the aeroplane.  
      
       
     40 The Appellants pressed upon the Court in the appeal that nonetheless the defence case has been prepared on a particular premise or theory, namely that the evidence for Mr Gilmour being the pilot was very weak. Hence evidence came at a late point after the trial had commenced and at a time when the defence had cross-examined Prosecution witnesses on the basis of that premise and in reliance upon there being no further scope for witness evidence. The Appellants pressed that the prejudice in consequence was sufficiently serious as to cause not only the Trial Judge’s discretion to miscarry but for that miscarriage to come within the limited range of circumstances as permit appellate review.  
      
       
     41 However, to succeed in challenging what was a discretionary determination in the course of trial on a matter of procedure and evidence, the Appellants must invoke the limited scope for appellate intervention, by demonstrating that the Trial Judge acted on an incorrect principle, gave weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters or gave no weight or insufficient weight to relevant considerations, accepting that where the nature of the error is not manifest or otherwise discoverable, the result may itself show that the mistake occurred, as where the appellant court may infer an error from an obviously unjust decision; see for example, Australian Coal & Shale Employees Federation v Commonwealth (1953) 94 CLR 621 at 627.  
      
       
     42 Here, it must be emphasised, the decision of the Trial Judge was an interlocutory one where appellate courts do not readily review such decisions; see generally House v the King (1936) 55 CLR 499.  
      
       
     43 The Appellants nonetheless contend that here a matter of general principle is involved. That Mr Gilmour, as an Appellant, would suffer an injustice if the original decision were allowed to stand so far as the admission of Mrs Gilmour’s evidence is concerned and the manner in which it was admitted.  
      
       
     44 The question of injustice or unfair prejudice is substantially answered by the failure of the defence at trial to seek an adjournment. It is further answered, insofar as unfair prejudice is concerned by the fact that, first, the defence witnesses had not yet been called. Second, it was not demonstrated in argument before this Court that the particular assumption upon which the defence had been prepared was such that the very structure and form of cross-examination were critically affected. This is more especially where no attack had been made on the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution. To the extent that further questions could have been directed, the defence chose not to seek to have prosecution witnesses recalled. Indeed in argument, the Appellants conceded that really the only consequence of admitting the late evidence was that it called for some tactical shift by the defence, though even that could have been accommodated had the defence sought an adjournment and the opportunity to further cross-examine prosecution witnesses, neither of which it did.  
      
       
     45 As to the first of the summarised grounds, the premature invocation of s18 before calling on the subpoena, clearly enough the Trial Judge in his judgment of 22 December 2000 did determine whether the Prosecutor should have been allowed to call on the subpoena. He did so, in considering whether Mrs Gilmour should have been permitted to be called at all. That is apparent from para 19 of the judgment of 22 December 2000, read in its earlier context.  
      
       
     46 As to whether the court should have excluded the evidence under the mandatory provisions of s137 of the Evidence Act, the short answer is this. Even if otherwise it were the case that its probative value in retrospect was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, the onus to have that evidence so excluded lay on the defence, who simply did not invoke s137 at trial. Clearly the onus to have such evidence excluded lies on the defence. Self-evidently this is because it is only the defence that can point to the danger of unfair prejudice, to be weighed against any probative value.  
      
       
     47 In any event, in circumstances where Mrs Gilmour, though reluctant to give evidence, did not chose to invoke s18 of the Evidence Act, it is difficult to see how such a contention can tenably now be made. An examination of her evidence, moreover, does not support that contention insofar as unfair prejudice is concerned.  
      
       
     48 In relation to the Trial Judge’s treatment of s18, there was indeed some confusion, though not such as to amount to any miscarriage of justice. The Prosecutor was said to have applied under s18 of the Evidence Act 1995 to call Mrs Gilmour as a witness in the case against her husband. That appears at para 9 of the judgment. However, the section is not invoked by the Prosecution but can only be invoked by the spouse.  
      
       
     49 Later in the judgment, the Trial Judge notes that Mrs Gilmour is “reluctant to comply”. In that context, if it were fairly said that she had in so demonstrating reluctance, objected to being required to give evidence even if not in terms of s18, then judicial consideration of s18 was required. Clearly enough the Trial Judge was not convinced by any matters before him that s18 could have been successfully invoked. I find no appealable error in that conclusion nor in the exercise of interlocutory discretion that underlay it.  
      
       
     50 Incidentally, in relation to para 40 of the Appellants’ written submissions, it is not correct to say that “even if the court was correct in admitting the evidence, the evidence of Mrs Gilmour can only go to establishing the fact that Mr Gilmour left for work on the days in question”. First, she did give evidence that student pilots are not permitted to carry out commercial activity on aircraft. Second, she chose not to put any matter in opposition to the proposition that Mr Gilmour was the pilot, indicating that “presumably” he was.  
      
       
     51 Finally, it is apparent that the Trial Judge was alive to the issue of the need for timely re-application to call Mrs Gilmour when the submissions were made. That is apparent in the initial exchange between bench and counsel for the defendants [AB, 160.39-.54] and as can be gleaned from the Trial Judge’s attempt to encapsulate the defendant’s submission [AB, 229.26-.29].  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     52 Ground 1 fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 – The learned Trial Judge erred in relying on the evidence of Mr Pierce. 
       
     53 This ground was not pressed. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 – The learned Trial Judge erred by not excluding the results of the testing by the Environment Protection Authority. 
       
     54 Here the Appellants’ argument starts with what it describes in its written submissions (para 52) as  
      
       
        
         
         “the clear failure by the prosecution to follow the guidelines as set out by the EPA, and as admitted by Mr Coade [the Senior Environmental Scientist with the Environment Protection Authority’s Coastal Catchments Unit] should have led to the exclusion of the testing results by the EPA.” 
         
        
       
     55 In argument, the Appellants put the case on the basis of an “express and unambiguous policy to reject samples” to be found in the Field Manual; see AB, Vol.3, 141, particular at 145. Paragraph 2 under the heading “Scope” states:  
      
       
        
         
         “This document describes procedures for the appropriate presentation of samples submitted to the EPA Laboratories. The procedures provide  
         guidance 
          on the selection of sample bottles, preservation, labelling, transportation and submission of the samples to the EPA Laboratories for chemical and/or microbiological analysis, including special requirements for Prosecution samples.” [emphasis added]  
         
        
        
       The heading on the Field Manual is “Requirements for Samples Submitted to the EPA Laboratories”. It, read with paragraph 2 supports the conclusion that this is stated policy but in the form of guidance. 
        
       
     56 However, the Trial Judge was clearly cognisant of deficiencies in the sampling, stating at para [45] of his judgment of 15 June 2001 the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “45. It is clear from the evidence, and is admitted by the EPA witnesses, that the water samples were not filtered on capture, and not frozen immediately. It is conceded by the prosecutor that these ‘ 
         precautions 
         ’ are mandated by the relevant EPA testing manual ( 
         Exhibit P17 
         ), with which Adair and Greenhalgh were familiar from special training sessions (see also relevant CW Regulations 1972 and reference material in  
         Exhibit D10 
         ). The evidence is that there are no freezing facilities for samples in EPA vehicles, and officers ‘ 
         keep them as cool as possible through use of bricks and eskies and that sort of stuff 
         ’ (Adair T188 L35-38, and T193 L8-40).” 
         
        
       
     57 Moreover, importantly, in the same judgment dealing with liability, at [84], after earlier dealing with “the question of pollution” in the context of the relevant legislation and in particular para (c) of the definition of “pollute” in s5 of the Clean Waters Act 1970, it is clear that he concluded, not that a particular measured increase had occurred in the concentration of phosphorus in the river, but rather that there had been simply an addition to the concentration of phosphorus in the river. Thus para [84] of the judgment states:  
      
       
        
         
         “The Court concludes that the pellets dropped from the aeroplane VH-CCH, which found their way in to the Gwydir River on 17 February 1999 added to the concentration of the phosphorus in the river at or near their point of entry. Even if somehow the riverbed sediments absorbed the phosphorous released from the pellets, the pollution test in the CW Act [ 
         Clean Waters Act 
          1970] is satisfied.” 
         
        
       
     58 It should be appreciated that para (c) of the definition of “pollute” in fact does not even require a change in the chemical or biological condition of the waters, in contrast to para (a) of that definition. It is simply concerned with the introduction of matter of a prescribed nature, into the relevant waters. Paragraph (c) reads,  
      
       
        
         
         “to place in or on, or otherwise introduce into or onto, the waters (whether through an act or omission) any matter, whether solid, liquid or gaseous that is of a prescribed nature, description or class or that does not comply with any standard prescribed in respect of that matter;” 
         
        
       
     59 Moreover, it should be noted that para (a) of the definition of “pollute” merely requires that the “physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed” but does not lay down any minimum level of change. 
      
       
     60 In that context, the evidence of Mr Coade is therefore relevant. His report accompanies his affidavit of 30 December 1999 and was before the Trial Judge. His report does not purport to state the quantum of any increase in the concentration of phosphorus but simply concludes that,  
      
       
        
         
         “there is a clearly higher concentration of free reactive phosphorus at site 2 on the 17 February (the day of the deposition) compared to sites upstream and downstream. This peak is reduced three day’s later (20 Feb) and almost disappeared nine day’s later (26 Feb). The deposition area (site 2) and the downstream location (site 1) have on all occasions higher concentrations of free reactive phosphorus than the upstream locations (sites 4 and 3). These results are consistent with an addition of phosphate phosphorus to the waters near site 2 on 17 February 1999.” 
         
        
       
     61 He then deals in his report with the addition of algae that he observed.  
      
       
     62 The effect of Mr Coade’s evidence that the relatively higher level “spike” of phosphorus measured in the sample taken from the section of the river where pellets had been deposited (site 2) as compared to the upstream and downstream sites, was consistent of the deposition and leaching of the fertiliser pellets having polluted the waters by changing the physical, chemical and biological condition of the waters.  
      
       
     63 Mr Coade was aware of the departures by the EPA officers from the sampling guideline both as to the samples not being frozen and as to the lack of filtration, as earlier identified (AB, 262.25-.30). These were identified in detail in his examination in chief. But he gave evidence to the effect that he nonetheless adhered to this opinion (AB, 263.42-.52) on the basis that the departures from the sampling protocols could not have affected the results to such degree as to raise doubt about the presence of the phosphorus “spike” at site 2.  
      
       
     64 Not only did Mr Coade in his evidence in chief expressly acknowledge and consider the departures by the EPA officers from the sampling protocols, but he was also thoroughly examined about his reliance on the sample results despite the departures from the sampling guidelines; AB, 269.39 – 275.57; AB, 282.6 – 285.44.  
      
       
     65 Mr Coade having provided the Trial Judge with the facts and reasoning process on which he justified adherence to his conclusions, regardless of the departures from the sampling protocols, it was open to the Trial Judge to accept Mr Coade’s opinion. No attack was made on Mr Coade’s opinion insofar as his being an expert or the opinion satisfying the requirements for an expert opinion; see Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2002) 52 NSWLR 705. The Trial Judge accepted Mr Coade as a reliable (indeed preferred) expert; see para [63] of the judgment of 15 June 2001 which follows a detailed consideration of the evidence relating to the quality control procedures in laboratory testing.  
      
       
     66 While the Appellants relied upon R v Olejarnik (1994) 33 NSWLR 567 at 573, the Respondent correctly submits that that case is not apposite here. In that case, the court held that a breath analysis certificate, which had been demanded outside a prescribed period of two hours, was inadmissible as to the blood alcohol level of the accused. This was, however, in the absence of expert (pharmacological) evidence to establish the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the event which gave rise to the requirement to submit for analysis. Here there is that expert evidence in relation to which the Trial Judge made a considered finding. Moreover it was a finding merely that there had been a change of condition of the waters. It was not one where the Trial Judge purported to measure the degree of that change, beyond placing an upper limit of the number of grams of phosphorus as “no more than 700 grams, the evidence would suggest”; see para [2] of the judgment of 24 September 2001 dealing with penalties. I shall revert to that judgment later in relation to the relevant appeal grounds.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
     67 Appeal Ground 3 fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 – The learned Trial Judge erred in interpreting the provisions of the  
       Clean Waters Regulation 
        1972. 
       
     68 This Ground can be shortly dealt with. It depends essentially upon the previous ground, namely that the EPA evidence was not admissible by reason of the sampling deficiencies, so that there could be no change in the condition of the water with the consequence that the Trial Judge’s earlier quoted conclusion at para [84] had no basis. However, for the purpose of determining whether para (a) of s5 of the definition of “pollute” was satisfied, it was open to the Trial Judge to accept the evidence of Mr Coade and to reach the conclusion he did at para [84]. Indeed to the extent that that conclusion may be said to follow from para (c) of the definition of “pollute” in s5 of the Clean Waters Act 1970, a conclusion inherent in the finding made, then that finding discloses no appealable error either. The Respondent submits that the words “added to” in para [84] point to para (a) of the definition of “pollute” being invoked, and that is clearly the case.  
      
       
     69 Insofar as the judgment could be criticised as failing with sufficient particularity to make a finding or determination in relation to para (c) (see judgment [83]), that, as the Respondent points out, is an error favouring the defendant’s interests. The result is that, to the extent error was thereby disclosed, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
      
       
        
       Ground 5 – The learned Trial Judge erred in failing to provide reasons for dismissing the reasonable hypothesis advanced by the defendant. 
        
       Ground 6 – The verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
       
     70 The Appellants dealt with these grounds together. As to the “reasonable hypothesis”, it was that the unknown person near the plane on or about the day of the offence may have been the pilot of the aircraft”. 
      
       
     71 Quite clearly the Trial Judge did deal with this issue; at [22] and [89] in particular para 7(d). He rejected that hypothesis with, albeit brief, reasons, in drawing the conclusion instead, a conclusion which the admittedly circumstantial evidence justified, that Mr Gilmour was flying the plane. I quote: 
      
       
        
         
         “89. There is  
         no direct evidence 
          that Gilmour was flying the plane on Wednesday morning 17 February 1999 but the evidence against him discloses the following 
          
          1. The defendant company operated two aircraft at the relevant time (VH-CCH and WH-ELK) (T233 L56-8), but employed/contracted only one pilot (T235 L46-52 and T236 L42-45). VH-CCH was usually parked at Armidale airfield (T237 L54-57). 
           
          2. The Defendant Gilmour was known to Peirce, and was the only person in the defendant company with whom Peirce dealt, specifically, in regard to the company’s application to Peirce’s land of the fertiliser supplied to the “ 
          Myanbah 
          ” airstrip by Croft. 
           
          3. Peirce attended the airstrip on the morning of Monday 15 February, and there saw Gilmour and another unidentified male person. Peirce accompanied Gilmour on a short flight on VH-CCH over the property, to establish the boundaries of the area to be fertilised, and saw Gilmour pilot the plane. No other person was in the plane at the time.  
           
          4. At various times on and between 15 and 17 February 1999, an aircraft was heard and/or seen flying east and west across “ 
          Myanbah 
          ”, and on 17 February, during such flights, the defendant company’s plane (VH-CCH) was seen to turn over Davidson’s house to fly back across Peirce’s land. Davidson saw what looked like a human head in the plane at the time, but not the pilot’s face.  
           
          5. At some time on 17 February 1999, planes were no longer seen or heard in the vicinity.  
           
          6. In the evening of 17 February 1999, the defendant Gilmour came to Peirce’s house by car, and collected from him a substantial cheque, in payment for the work the defendant company had contracted to do for Peirce on a commercial basis.  
           
          7. Mrs Gilmour testified: 
           
            
            (a) that she saw her husband leave home, presumably to go to work, on the morning of 17 February 1999 (T236 L16),  
             
            (b) that she “ 
            can only presume that Glenn 
            ” did the “ 
            Myanbah 
            ” job (T236 L14),  
             
            (c) that she did not actually see who did the job (T236 L2), nor did she see the plane, nor who flew it, on 15, 16 or 17 February (T238 L47-55). The company’s statement in response to the EPA’s notice under s193 was not based on Mrs Gilmour’s “ 
            observation or actual knowledge 
            ” (T239 L4-15),  
             
            (d) that the plane could have been flown on 17 February by others, including student pilots or a licensed pilot needing to get “ 
            hours 
            ” (T237 L10-50), but student pilots are not permitted to carry out commercial activity on aircraft (T239 L39-47). Mrs Gilmour was not asked about other employees of the defendant company, nor about the third man at the airstrip on 15 February,  
             
            (e) that she prepared an invoice on 18 February 1999, stating that the spreading of fertiliser on “ 
            Myanbah 
            ” was completed on 17 February 1999 (see T234 L46 and T239 L22-30).”  
            
           
          
         
        
       
     72 In so doing, the Trial Judge recognised the proper criminal standard to be applied was that the relevant finding be the only rational hypothesis regarding the relevant events, when that finding, as here, was based on circumstantial evidence. The Trial Judge gave no weight to Mr Gilmour’s failure to offer any explanation. This was in accordance with the High Court’s recent delineation for criminal cases of the relevant principles precluding such weight or any adverse comment to the jury save in the rare case where the accused declines to offer an explanation but where the evidence was capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused; see Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25 at [61] to [68]. He concludes that the exception did not apply, as there were other avenues of enquiry available to the Respondent; at [97] to [98]. The Trial Judge was entitled to find, as he did, without giving any weight to the absence of evidence from Mr Gilmour that Mr Gilmour was flying the relevant plane; there was no appealable error and the verdict was not unsafe and unsatisfactory.  
      
       
        
       Appeals Against Sentence 
       
     73 The Trial Judge did not accept the submission on behalf of the Appellants that “this particular offence, although of low seriousness, is ‘trivial’ enough to obtain, for either defendant, the benefit of s10.” Clearly, therefore, the Trial Judge directed his mind to that question. At para [11] he states his reasons for that conclusion,  
      
       
        
         
         “the aerial agricultural industry is important to both the economy, and the environment, and less than perfect attention to ensuring  
         no 
          environmental harm results from operations such as those in this case must attract a penalty of some sort. See the discussion in  
         Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority 
          (2001) 113 LGERA 357.” 
         
        
       
     74 The Trial Judge was clearly referring to the reasoning of Mahoney JA at 399 where indeed the company was fined $50,000, the size of the fine no doubt reflecting the greater quantum of pollutant as against the much lower fine of $6,000 here. But the observations made by Mahoney JA are directly applicable, quoted below:  
      
       
        
         
         “In determining the fine appropriate to an offence of pollution, two things are to be borne in mind: the seriousness with which the community regards pollution of this kind; and the purposes sought to be achieved by the imposition of fines in cases such as these.  
         
        
        
         
         The community has adopted a stern policy against pollution. The legislative scheme requires that proper, and strict, precautions be taken by those whose activities may cause proscribed pollution. The quantum of the fines which may be imposed evidences this: for the present offence, a maximum fine of $125,000 was available. The quantum of the fines which the legislation allows to be imposed has no doubt been fixed not merely to indicate the seriousness with which such pollution is regarded but also to deter those engaged in such activities and to procure that they will take the precautions necessary to ensure that it does not occur.”  
         
        
       
     75 The conclusion reached by the Trial Judge was well open to him. While the amount of grams may have been as few as 10 grams as was argued before us, the Trial Judge clearly was concerned with the principles expressed by Mahoney JA, including the importance of deterrence. No doubt implications of “less than perfect attention” would have been present in the Trial Judge’s mind, namely that in legislation of strict of liability, environmental harm results from the cumulative effect of breaches, though individually small.  
      
       
     76 Indeed as regards the Appeal Ground 8 in relation to Tableland Topdressing and 9 in relation to Mr Gilmour, namely that the Trial Judge erred in holding that the defendant should have exercised more care being “against the evidence before the court”, that overlooks that the legislation does indeed in some of its strictures require “perfect attention to ensuring no environmental harm”, as the Trial Judge points out. Thus the evidence of Mr Patten, called by the Appellants on sentence, as to the circumstances in which fertiliser could be inadvertently applied from the air to areas outside the target area, was to the Trial Judge simply “one class of possible explanation for such discharge” but, based on his reasoning, beside the point. As the Trial Judge said at para [5], “the court simply does not know how to explain the discharges, other than the failure (however explicable) on the part of the defendants to take sufficient care and precautions.” The Trial Judge goes on to say, “even so, the degree of culpability has not been proven to be very high. The evidence of environmental harm is sufficient to make out the offence, but is not strong (see paras [60] to [83] of the June judgment). There is no specific or lasting harm done.”  
      
       
     77 All of this bears on a sentence in which a relatively modest penalty, $6,000 within a much higher range, was imposed on both Mr Gilmour and the corporation. This was within the discretion of the sentencing judge, and well within permissible range. The mere smallness of the number of grams does not make the offence trivial, when regard is had, as s10 invites, to the other relevant factors, namely those identified by the Trial Judge in paras [6] to [11] above and in particular those quoted.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     78 Both in relation to Mr Gilmour and Tableland Topdressing Pty Limited, none of the Grounds of Appeal, individually or cumulatively, are such as to warrant disturbance of the Trial Judge’s sentence.

12590,2767326,AG v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWCA 218,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 15 November 2013, Magistrate Denes, at Lismore Local Court, found the applicant guilty of four counts of aggravated indecency; three involving his step-daughter, GL and one involving his step-granddaughter, SD. The magistrate’s determination turned entirely upon acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the complainants. The applicant was sentenced on 24 January 2014; on that day he appealed from the convictions and the severity of the sentence. On 25 September 2014, the District Court judge, Whitford DCJ, set aside the conviction on one charge (in relation to which the applicant provided alibi evidence) but dismissed the appeal with respect to the other three charges. (The sentence appeal remains outstanding.) On 13 November 2014, the applicant sought to review the judgment of the District Court and have the remaining convictions quashed pursuant to the supervisory jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). The applicant alleged that the primary judge misapprehended the extent of his jurisdiction under s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“Appeal and Review Act”) and failed to form his own view of the matter; the judge thus fell into jurisdictional error.

The Court (Basten JA, Simpson JA and Sackville AJA) held, dismissing the summons.

(per Basten JA; Simpson JA and Sackville AJA agreeing)

1.   The conviction appeal from the Local Court to the District Court is by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings unless fresh evidence is adduced in circumstances provided by the Appeal and Review Act. Further, the District Court judge is bound to observe the “natural limitations” where the appeal is conducted by reference to a documentary record: [5].

Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), ss 11, 18, 19.

2.   The primary judge, after setting out the background of the charges and convictions, proceeded to address errors which the applicant alleged were committed by the magistrate: [42], [104]. Having identified error in the manner the magistrate dealt with the charge in relation to which the applicant offered alibi evidence, the primary judge set aside that conviction: [44], [70]-[71]. As for the other challenges, the primary judge considered the material before him, conscious of the “natural limitations” resulting from not seeing or hearing the witnesses including the complainants (being cross-examined) and the applicant: [46], [105]. Nothing in this approach was indicative of any failure to carry out appellate function. To the contrary, the approach adopted demonstrated that the primary judge understood what was required of him by s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act and the relevant authorities: [47], [106].

Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 referred to.

3.   The applicant’s specific submission that the primary judge failed to consider or overlooked the fact that the magistrate did not properly consider the applicant’s evidence and thus fell into jurisdictional error cannot be accepted. The primary judge made a specific finding that, despite the lack of express observations justifying the rejection of the applicant’s evidence, the entirety of the magistrate’s approach demonstrated consciousness that she had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainants’ evidence, otherwise she would have to acquit the applicant: [114]-[115].

Comments by two members of the Court as to the nature of the appeal by way of rehearing under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act:

(per Basten JA)

4.   The statement in Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; 65 NSWLR 539 at [39] that the powers of the District Court on an appeal under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act are “not dependent upon finding of error at the original trial” is not consistent with recent authorities of this and other courts suggesting that appellant must demonstrate some legal, factual or discretionary error for the appeal to succeed: [9], [12].

Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40, 203 CLR 172; Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52; Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92 referred to.

5.   The term “error”, however, has no precise meaning; it requires the appellate judge to be satisfied that the judgement under appeal is wrong and should be corrected. How that satisfaction is achieved will depend on a range of factors relevant to specific cases: [34].

Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833; 117 FCR 424; Costa v The Public Trustee of NSW [2008] NSWCA 223; 1 ASTLR 56 referred to.

(per Simpson JA)

6.   Despite the recent statements of the Court of Appeal that it is necessary for the appellant on appeal from the Local Court to the District Court to demonstrate “legal, factual or discretionary error”: Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92, other authorities, and also the manner in which the Court of Appeal in Mulder dealt with the applications for judicial review of the District Court decisions, support the view that the appeal under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act does not depend on a finding of any error by the magistrate: [76], [81], [85]; [87], [97].

Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 4 April 2012 the applicant was arrested and charged with four counts of aggravated indecency, three involving his stepdaughter, GL, and one involving his step-granddaughter, SD. (The applicant and the complainants are anonymous in keeping with the statutory prohibition on publication of material identifying the complainants. [1] ) The charges were heard over seven days at Lismore Local Court, before Magistrate Denes. The applicant was found guilty on each count, judgment being delivered on 15 November 2013. The matter was adjourned to 24 January 2014 for sentence.
	
	
	The applicant appealed, pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), against both convictions and sentences. According to the judgment on appeal given in the District Court on 25 September 2014, the notice of appeal was dated 24 January 2014 which was described as the day on which he was convicted of the offences. However, the Local Court transcript clearly records the magistrate convicting him on 15 November 2013. [2] 
	
	
	On the appeal, the primary judge (Whitford DCJ) set aside the conviction on one charge but dismissed the appeal with respect to the other three charges. The magistrate imposed custodial sentences which were stayed by the lodging of the appeal; the judge continued bail. Although the appeal extended to the severity of the sentences imposed, nothing before this Court identified the sentences, nor was that part of the appeal disposed of in the District Court, [3]  the outstanding matters being stood over to a date to be fixed.
	
	
	There is no right of appeal from the judgment of the District Court. In that circumstance, the applicant filed a summons on 13 November 2014 seeking to have this Court quash his convictions pursuant to the supervisory jurisdiction conferred by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). An amended summons was filed on 6 February 2015, although the nature of the amendments is not apparent.
	


Appellate jurisdiction of District Court


	
	Although the point was inadequately addressed in the submissions of the parties, this case raised in stark form a difficulty inherent in the statutory scheme for appeals in criminal jurisdiction from the Local Court to the District Court. That is, how is the District Court to approach an appeal against conviction where the outcome depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainants, on the one hand, and of the defendant, on the other? On the basis of the statutory provisions and authorities referred to below, three propositions are well established, namely:
	



	
	the appeal, described as “by way of rehearing”, does not involve a hearing de novo (or fresh trial) as if the original trial had not occurred;
	
	
	the appeal is not an appeal “in the strict sense”, so as to be limited to the evidence before the magistrate, to be determined on the law as it then applied; and
	
	
	the judge on appeal is bound to observe the “natural limitations” which arise where the appeal is conducted by reference to a documentary record.
	



	
	In circumstances where neither party seeks to call oral evidence on the appeal, the following outcomes must be considered:
	



	
	if the appellant fails to demonstrate error on the part of the magistrate, the appeal must be dismissed;
	
	
	if the prosecutor (respondent) is unable to persuade the judge that the charges have been made out beyond reasonable doubt, the appeal must be upheld;
	
	
	the judge, being unable to determine the matter in the absence of oral evidence, must require the parties to call witnesses; or
	
	
	the judge, being unable to determine the matter, must set aside the conviction and remit the matter to the magistrate.
	



	
	For reasons which will be explained, there are difficulties attending the adoption of any one of these solutions. To understand why that is so, it is necessary to have regard to the statutory scheme encompassed by the key provisions of the Appeal and Review Act.
	


11   Appeals as of right

(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence (or both).

…

14   Lodgment of appeals and applications for leave to appeal

(1)   An appeal under section 11 or 11A is to be made by lodging a written notice of appeal with:

(a)   a registrar of the Local Court, or

(b)   the person in charge of the place where the appellant is in custody.

(2)   A notice of appeal must state the general grounds of appeal.

…

18   Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence

(1)   An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.

(2)   Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.

(3)   The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence.

19   Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person

(1)   The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:

(a)   in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or

(b)   in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence.

(2)   An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct.

(3)   If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal.

(4)   A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant.

(5)   The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1).

(6)   Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings.

20   Determination of appeals

(1)   The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction:

(a)   by setting aside the conviction, or

(b)   by dismissing the appeal, or

(c)   in the case of an appeal made with leave under section 12(1) – by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with any directions of the District Court.

(2)   The District Court may determine an appeal against sentence:

(a)   by setting aside the sentence, or

(b)   by varying the sentence, or

(c)   by dismissing the appeal.


	
	Because the determination of the charges depended entirely upon accepting the evidence of the complainants and rejecting the evidence of the defendant as not raising a reasonable doubt, all the judge could say was that it was open to the magistrate to accept the evidence of the complainants and reject that of the defendant, so as to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as charged. Put negatively, the judge could not be satisfied on the material before him beyond reasonable doubt, because he had neither seen nor heard the complainants cross-examined, nor had he seen or heard the defendant give evidence. (He had seen and heard a video recording of the complainants’ evidence-in-chief.) This raises starkly a question as to which of the possibilities noted above should follow.
	
	
	There are statements which appear to contradict the first possibility, namely that for an appeal to succeed, the appellant must persuade the judge that the magistrate erred. The primary support for that negative proposition is to be found in Gianoutsos v Glykis. [4]  It is necessary to set out the statements from the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Hislop JJ expressed agreement):
	


“[37]   In Allesch v Maunz [5]  the High Court considered the appeal provisions under the Family Court Act. In the course of the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ their [Honours] said at 180: [6] 

‘For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error (see CDJ v VAJ [7] ), whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised regardless of error.’ (emphasis added)

[38]   In the present case, the legislation does indicate that the District Court’s appellate powers may be exercised regardless of error. Section 20 of the [Appeal and Review Act] provides that on an appeal from a magistrate the District Court may either set aside a conviction (or in this case an APVO), or it may dismiss the appeal. The District Court is not limited to ordering fresh proceedings in the court below. Indeed, unlike the Supreme Court (see s 55(1)(b) of the [Appeal and Review Act]), the District Court is given no express power to remit the matter back to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with its directions. In R v Kurtic [8] , Hunt CJ at CL noted that the power to determine an appeal otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that a court with such a power is not a court of error. [9] 

[39]   The District Court has power to rehear issues at trial but does not have power to remit the matter back to the Local Court. It follows that the District Court’s powers under s 18 of the [Appeal and Review Act] are not dependent upon a finding of error at the original trial.

[40]   An appeal under s 18 of the [Appeal and Review Act] is an appeal of this nature.”


	
	The critical element in this reasoning is that the absence of a power to remit means that the powers exercised by the District Court are not dependent upon a finding of error. (Contrary to the reference at [39], the powers are not found in s 18, but in s 20.) However, there is an elision in the reasoning: if the District Court sets the conviction aside, what is the consequence? There are three possible consequences, namely:
	


(a)   the charge is dismissed;

(b)   the defendant is convicted of a lesser offence; or

(c)   there is a charge which remains to be determined.


	
	If s 20(1) is to be read as limited to the powers expressly conferred, there is no power to do either of (a) or (b). In that (somewhat unsatisfactory) state of affairs, (c) is the most plausible consequence, because an undetermined charge does not need to be remitted – the function of the Local Court remains unperformed.
	
	
	Assuming for present purposes that the District Court does not have a power of remitter, there is no doubt that it has power to “rehear” the charges subject to appeal. However, it is difficult to understand why a power to set aside a conviction is, in the absence of a power to remit, not dependent upon a finding of error. In considering the statutory scheme, it appears that insufficient weight was given to the fact that the District Court was conducting “an appeal”; that with respect to “an appeal by way of rehearing” the usual understanding is that the appellant must demonstrate some form of legal, factual or discretionary error, but that error may be identified from evidence which was not before the magistrate. This view is consistent with recent authority in this Court. [10] 
	
	
	Two other matters were relied upon in Gianoutsos. The first was the distinction drawn, by contrast with an appeal to the Supreme Court against conviction, between an order setting aside the conviction and an order “setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the Local Court … for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court’s directions”. [11]  There are two reasons for doubting the value of the comparison. First, appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court against conviction or sentence can only be made as of right “on a ground that involves a question of law alone.” [12]  Where an appeal is brought on a ground that involves a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact, leave is required. [13]  The different functions of the Supreme Court provide a basis for the statement of powers in a different form. Secondly, and consequentially upon the first point, it is understandable that, where there is an appeal on a question of law, the statute should expressly provide for the Supreme Court to give directions as to how the matter is to be redetermined.
	
	
	The final aspect of Gianoutsos to be noted is the reference to the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kurtic. [14]  In that passage, Hunt CJ at CL stated that the Court of Criminal Appeal, exercising functions under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), “acts as a court of error.” If error were established, and subject to the proviso to s 6(1), the power of the Court was to order a new trial: there was no power to make a finding that could have been made by the trial court. The point being made was that similar limitations applied where the trial was by judge alone, rather than before a jury. The contrary proposition, namely that the power to act otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that the court was not a court of error, is not to be found in the judgment. What is more, such a proposition would be inconsistent with the reasoning in Allesch v Maunz set out by the Chief Judge in Gianoutsos in the preceding paragraph. It is not in doubt that the District Court (a) does not conduct a hearing de novo, (b) is not limited to an appeal in the strict sense, but (c) is to conduct a rehearing. Kurtic may be put to one side.
	
	
	Finally, with respect to Gianoutsos, it is important to note the context in which the reasoning appears. The judge in the District Court had dealt with the appeal as if it were a hearing de novo. In response to questions stated for the Court of Criminal Appeal, it was held (uncontroversially) that this approach was in error. It was clearly an error of law. The comments set out above were made in discussing whether it was an error of law (which could hardly be doubted), although that was also said not to be material to the resolution of the matter. [15]  Most of the arguments set out above were therefore unnecessary for the conclusion reached and, except quite indirectly, did not support it.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel, [16]  Spigelman CJ (Tobias JA agreeing) noted that it was “common ground” that the District Court had no power to order a remitter to the Local Court. I suggested the following analysis: [17] 
	


“[59]   The second resolution is that a power of remittal exists on an appeal to the District Court. In Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45; 168 CLR 1 Dawson J explained that a magistrates’ court, although an inferior court with limited jurisdiction, ‘undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise’: at 16. These principles were adopted and applied in Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at [50]-[51] (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ), their Honours noting that reference to ‘necessary implication’ was to be understood as identifying a power to make orders ‘which are reasonably required or legally ancillary to the accomplishment of the specific remedies’ provided in the statute.

[60]   The District Court had undoubted power to set aside the conviction and sentence: Appeal and Review Act, s 20. If the charges were to be pursued, that could only properly take place in the Local Court. There may be doubt as to whether an order of remittal were necessary. Assuming it was, it was arguably an order necessary to give effect to the judgment setting aside the conviction and was therefore within the implied powers of that Court, in the particular circumstances of the case.”


	
	This issue was also addressed in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Burns. [18]  The issue in Burns was whether the District Court judge, having identified error of a kind relevant in the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction, rather than an appeal on the merits, erred in “quashing” the conviction. The Court was unanimous in dismissing the Director’s application for judicial review. After referring to the clear statement to similar effect in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Cavanough, [19]  Beazley JA said: [20] 
	


“The setting aside of a conviction is not equivalent to dismissing a charge or to finding a person not guilty, although on a successful appeal under s 11 that would be the intention behind setting aside the conviction.”


	
	Beazley JA (with whom Campbell JA agreed) considered whether there was an implied power to remit in circumstances where the intention was that the charge should be dismissed. The suggestion raised by me in Emanuel was rejected as not expressing a concluded view and as dealing with a different case. [21]  Beazley JA was ultimately persuaded that the matter could be resolved by reference to s 73 of the Appeal and Review Act which states:
	


73   Evidence of setting aside of conviction or sentence

(1)   If a conviction or sentence is set aside on an appeal, the registrar of the appeal court must cause a memorandum to that effect to be endorsed on the conviction or on the order by which the sentence was imposed.

(2)   A copy of the memorandum is sufficient evidence that the conviction or sentence has been set aside.


	
	What was not explained was how a recording that a conviction had been set aside amounted to the dismissal of a charge, in circumstances where the setting aside of the conviction did not have that effect.
	
	
	I referred in Burns to the reasoning in Emanuel and Cavanough; I further noted that, on an appeal by way of rehearing, the appellate court will usually be entitled to intervene where it finds a material error. [22] 
	
	
	Before reaching any conclusion with respect to the options available to the District Court, it is convenient to return to the language in the statutory provisions. First, as has been noted, s 11(1) confers a right to “appeal” against a conviction. Although the term “appeal” is not always used in a technically correct sense, its use in combination with the provision in s 18(1) that the appeal “is to be by way of rehearing” is to adopt language which conventionally invokes appellate jurisdiction and not original jurisdiction, as would be the case with a fresh hearing. Yet to identify the function of the District Court as one in which the prosecution bears the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt, in the absence of any demonstrated error on the part of the magistrate, is to import into the appeal a critical feature of a fresh hearing.
	
	
	Secondly, although it is common for a statutory appeal by way of rehearing to permit the adducing of fresh or further evidence, there are always limits on that power. [23]  The powers in ss 18 and 19 are broader. Section 18(1) provides the norm, namely that the appeal will be reheard “on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”. That proposition is said to be subject to s 19, but it is also, by necessary implication, subject to s 18(2). The latter provision permits “fresh evidence” to be given by leave of the District Court and only if the Court is satisfied that it is “in the interests of justice”. The term “fresh evidence” is defined to mean “evidence in addition to or in substitution for” the evidence given in the Local Court. [24] 
	
	
	The concept of evidence in substitution for evidence given at trial is somewhat ambiguous. There may be an inference that either party can withdraw evidence given before the magistrate, in the sense of excluding it from the record. There does not appear to be any discussion of such an approach in the cases, although there have been cases dealing with additional evidence, such as an attempt by the prosecution to rely on post-conviction admissions by the defendant. [25]  The need to satisfy the Court that adducing such evidence would be “in the interests of justice” may make the tender of fresh evidence unusual.
	
	
	The circumstances referred to in s 19 fall into a different category. Although the provision refers generally to persons being required to attend and give evidence, it appears to set its own criteria and thus does not operate by way of qualification to s 18(2). On that basis, it should be understood as referring to persons who gave evidence before the magistrate. Two categories are envisaged, namely evidence from persons who have been the victims of violence and other cases. The complainants in the present case would fall within the first category. Accordingly, the court could only direct that they attend to give evidence if satisfied that “there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice” that course should be taken. (It is not necessary to consider for present purposes the nature of the difference between “special reasons” – in par (a) – and “substantial reasons” – in par (b).) The critical issue, which again appears not to have been addressed in the cases, is whether the fact that the conviction depended upon the credibility of the victim would constitute a “special reason”, making it in the interests of justice for her to be required to attend and give evidence. On one view, that must be a common occurrence, in which case it would be contrary to the plain intention of the provision, namely to protect victims of violence from repetitive court appearances, [26]  because it would permit that to happen routinely.
	
	
	The operation of the provision was not addressed in argument, there having been no application by either party to call any person who gave evidence before the magistrate. That raises two questions. First, does the District Court judge have a power to make a direction on his or her own motion? Secondly, if not, how is the judge to dispose of the appeal?
	
	
	Again, the first question is largely theoretical in this case: there was no challenge to the failure of the judge to give such a direction. Accordingly, it should be accepted that the judge acted within power by seeking to dispose of the matter without hearing the complainants’ cross-examined and without hearing the defendant give evidence.
	
	
	The second question, however, becomes critical: if the onus were on the appellant to demonstrate some error on the part of the magistrate in order to have the convictions set aside, he did not do so and, for reasons given below, the judge did not fail to exercise his jurisdiction in concluding that there was no such error. On the other hand, if the onus on the appeal were, despite the lack of demonstrable error, on the prosecution to prove to the satisfaction of the judge that the defendant was properly convicted, it could not do so without the judge hearing the relevant evidence.
	
	
	There is no authority which supports the latter conclusion. Adopting that conclusion would, to a large extent, make the appeal a de novo hearing where the case is one of oath against oath. That is entirely inconsistent with the conventional understanding of an appeal by way of rehearing; it is also inconsistent with the common statements that the appeal judge should be conscious of the “natural limitations” on his or her power to assess the record of evidence given before the magistrate. Those comments have never been accompanied by a suggestion that the judge should have the witnesses recalled; rather, at least implicitly, they assume that the judge should accept the credibility findings of the magistrate in the absence of some demonstrated reason to doubt them.
	
	
	In Charara v The Queen [27]  Mason P, having referred to the terms of s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act, stated: [28] 
	


“The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court”.


	
	Mason P noted, referring to the civil case of Fox v Percy, [29]  that the court must of necessity observe the “natural limitations” that exist where a review is undertaken on the record. [30]  In Fox v Percy, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated: [31] 
	


“These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.”


	
	On the present application, counsel for the Director took the concept of limitations noted in Fox v Percy a step further. She identified the power of the appellate court to review factual findings based on credibility as available only where error is demonstrated by “incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony” [32]  or else, in quite rare cases, where the decision at trial is “glaringly improbable” or “contrary to compelling inferences”. [33] 
	
	
	There are two reasons to approach such language with caution. First, where the court has a written judgment from the trial judge, as opposed to an opaque verdict of a jury, it may be possible to identify error in an assessment of credibility without demanding satisfaction of phrases expressed at a high level of generality and with a degree of hyperbole. Secondly, the exercise being undertaken in the criminal jurisdiction imposes a different frame of reference. Where, on an appeal from a conviction on indictment, it is alleged that a jury verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or where error is otherwise established and the court is required to consider whether no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred (the proviso [34] ), a somewhat similar exercise is required. Thus, in considering the application of the proviso, the High Court stated in Weiss v The Queen: [35] 
	


“Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	In identifying the scope of the statutory task, the Court in Weiss then noted that, in making its own independent assessment of the evidence, and determining whether the guilt of the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the appellate court will make “due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record”. [36]  The reference to “natural limitations” picked up the language of Fox v Percy at [23], [37]  but did not adopt the emphatic language at [28] and [29].
	
	
	Although the cases dealing with appeals (as distinct from further hearings) frequently refer to discernment of “error”, that term has no precise meaning. It refers broadly to the satisfaction of the appellate judge that the trial judge was “wrong and should be corrected.” [38]  Put negatively, it means that the judgment of the trial judge will not be set aside unless the appellate judge is satisfied that the judgment is wrong. How that state of satisfaction is achieved will depend upon a range of factors. [39]  Indeed, a miscarriage of justice warranting intervention may occur in the absence of “error” in the ordinary meaning of that term. [40] 
	
	
	In considering the nature of the exercise to be undertaken by this Court, it is permissible to have regard to the errors sought to be identified in the District Court and the issues thereby raised for consideration by the primary judge. In short, with possible exceptions which need not be considered, it is not open to the applicant to allege a failure on the part of the District Court to exercise its jurisdiction by reference to challenges to the Local Court judgment which were not raised in the District Court.
	
	
	Two further matters, one of principle and one of practice, should be noted. With respect to principle, in circumstances where the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to consider for itself whether the evidence supported a verdict of guilty, SKA v The Queen, [41]  Simpson J declined to view a video of the complainant’s evidence-in-chief on the basis that to do so might create an imbalanced impression as the court would not be viewing the evidence of other witnesses, nor indeed the cross-examination of the complainant. [42]  In the High Court, a ground alleging error in that constrained approach was rejected. [43]  Although the District Court judge did watch the videos, that exercise did not assist him in identifying error on the part of the magistrate. [44] 
	
	
	The issue of practice concerns the standard notice used to commence an appeal to the District Court from the Local Court. No standard form is prescribed, but one is supplied by the Court. For an appeal against conviction, the notice effectively requires that the appellant mark a box giving as the reason, “I am not guilty”. That would be appropriate for a fresh hearing, but not for an appeal by way of rehearing. Arguably, the form itself does not comply with s 14(2) of the Appeal and Review Act which requires the notice to state “the general grounds of appeal.” That statutory language implies the need to state, at least in general terms, some basis upon which the magistrate is thought to have erred.
	


Application of principles


	
	Neither the summons nor the applicant’s written submissions identified specific grounds upon which the relief was sought. Given the limited nature of this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction, that omission resulted in the written submissions filed on behalf of the respondent Director dealing with the supposed errors on the part of the judge in a confined way, without addressing all the issues raised by the applicant’s submissions.
	
	
	As the case was presented, the primary ground of challenge was that the judge misapprehended the extent of his statutory jurisdiction under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act and thereby dealt with the appeal on a more limited basis than was required by law. Such a challenge may be described as a constructive failure on the part of the judge hearing the appeal to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court. That is a permissible ground of review and constitutes jurisdictional error, if made good. No other form of legal or factual error is reviewable by this Court. [45]  That means that this Court cannot (and was not invited to) review any aspect of the decision in the Local Court. Indeed, that course would no longer be appropriate, the judgment of the Local Court having been superseded by the judgment in the District Court. [46]  That is not to say that the evidence before the Local Court and the magistrate’s reasons were not relevant and admissible to allow an understanding of the course of the District Court proceedings
	
	
	The primary material available to this Court to assess a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction is the judgment of the District Court. Usually it would be necessary to have regard to the initiating process in that Court in order to understand the scope of the appeal. That document was not available, but it appears from material which was tendered that the parties proceeded on the basis that it was, in colloquial terms, an “all grounds appeal”. [47]  That, it may be accepted, was intended to invoke the full extent of the statutory jurisdiction. However, like many colloquialisms, the phrase, implying a fresh hearing, is inaccurate. No part of either s 18 or s 19 was invoked: the evidence before the District Court was limited to the transcript of proceedings in the Local Court, together with both audio-visual recordings and transcripts of the police interviews with the two complainants. Other than the evidence-in-chief of the complainants, the District Court judge therefore neither heard nor saw any of the witnesses called over seven days in the Local Court. He did not see or hear the cross-examination of the complainants.
	
	
	The function able to be performed by the appeal court in those circumstances is constrained. Particularly is that so where, as in the present case, the convictions were almost entirely dependent upon acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the two complainants, who were approximately 10 or 11 years of age at the date of the alleged offences and a year or so older at the date of the trial.
	
	
	Having set out the background to the charges and convictions, the primary judge noted [48]  that the appellant had filed “extensive written submissions” and had “addressed orally, in considerable detail, on the various matters raised in those written submissions.” He then sought to identify two categories of challenge, the first being specified errors committed by the magistrate; the second being aspects of the evidence which were said to cause “such disquiet in respect of the result as to warrant allowing the appeal and setting aside the convictions.” [49] 
	
	
	The judge addressed the errors by reference to the following categories, namely:
	



	
	various errors said to indicate prejudgment;
	
	
	misuse of evidence that the appellant’s wife left home suddenly with her daughter and
	
	
	evidence of an alibi with respect to the first offence involving GL (referred to as the sequence 3 offence).
	



	
	The judge dealt in an orderly manner with the particulars said to give rise to prejudgment and rejected the various complaints. He dealt separately with complaints concerning the departure of the applicant’s wife, [50]  and the issue involving the alibi. [51]  With respect to the alibi, the judge noted that the magistrate had accepted as a real possibility that the applicant was not in Ballina (where the offence was alleged to have occurred) at the time in question. That should have been sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in circumstances where the prosecution had amended the particular charge so as to specify the day on which the events took place. The judge treated the magistrate as having determined that issue on the basis that the charge alleged an offence “on or around” the specified date, which he held to be incorrect. He therefore set aside the conviction on that charge.
	
	
	None of this material reveals any failure to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court. Further, the approach adopted by the judge followed the submissions in the District Court in identifying particular deficiencies in the prosecution case. However, beyond addressing the specific challenges, the judge felt unable to carry out a conclusive assessment of the whole of the evidence, which was described by the appellant in his submissions as involving “oath against oath”. Thus, the judge stated: [52] 
	


“Frankly, having seen the interviews of the girls, I see no reason why the matters that her Honour took into account are not available to her Honour as matters persuasive of the credibility and reliability of the complainants.

Contrary to the submission put on behalf of the appellant, it seems to me that this was a case which was well capable of being determined by reference to the complainants’ evidence, provided they were accepted to the requisite standard and nothing intervened which necessarily disturbed or precluded such a conclusion.

It is true there was no forensic evidence, nor was there anything in the way of corroboration of either of the complainants. That is not an infrequent feature of cases of this kind. It seems to me that the Magistrate adequately directed herself in respect of the care and scrutiny with which her task had to be approached, having regard to the Prosecution’s reliance in each case on the evidence of a single witness.”


	
	Having assessed the second issue noted above, the judge returned to the theme just outlined, stating: [53] 
	


“In adjudicating on this appeal, I am acutely conscious of the natural limitations that exist in approaching an appeal based substantially on the record below. These limitations are well reflected in judgments of superior courts concerning appeals from the Local Court to this court. Those limitations of course include the disadvantage which I have, relative to the Magistrate, in respect of the evaluation of witnesses and in respect of the opportunity she had over quite a lengthy interval, to reflect upon the evidence and draw conclusions from it. The submission was made that the Magistrate’s advantage is mitigated on the appeal because I have had access to and viewed the evidence in chief of the two complainants.

I have seen the interviews of each of the complainants. I have not, however, had the advantage of seeing or hearing any of the other witnesses including the appellant (other than through viewing his recorded interview), nor of seeing or hearing the cross-examinations of the complainants.

Her Honour plainly gave careful consideration to the evidence of all of the witnesses and dealt expressly with the matters raised in argument on behalf of the appellant. Many of the criticisms that are made of her Honour’s findings and the process by which she reached them are not capable of sensible resolution by me, having resort only to the transcript of most of that evidence. The resolution of most of those matters, in particular in connection with the various identified deficiencies in the evidence of [GL and SD], depends upon the unique benefit the Magistrate had of seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence and making corresponding assessments of what and whom to believe. Those assessments frequently depend on subtleties which simply cannot adequately be taken account of by resort only to a transcript, even when it is partially supplemented by some recorded evidence. Those assessments require an understanding of the dynamics of the hearing, and the close observation of the witnesses. Her Honour, at least in respect of exposing why she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of the complainants, went to considerable lengths to expose those matters that informed her assessment.

It seems to me that the Magistrate appropriately directed herself, and she considered carefully the various matters which addressed the question of whether she could accept beyond reasonable doubt the accounts of the complainants. With one exception, which I will come to shortly, there is nothing in the material, nor in the arguments advanced, which objectively points to any failing on her Honour’s part in the adjudication of the matter or which calls for any different result on this appeal by way of rehearing.”


	
	There is nothing in this passage which demonstrates a failure on the part of the judge to carry out his function under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act. On the contrary, he clearly understood that the appeal was by way of rehearing, using language reminiscent of that used in Fox v Percy and other cases, such as Weiss, reflecting the function of the court conducting a rehearing, subject to identifiable limitations.
	
	
	In these circumstances, a legitimate basis of challenge in the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court, which may be identified as a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction, has not been established.
	
	
	The summons should be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	SIMPSON JA: The circumstances in which this application comes before the Court are set out in [1]-[4] of the judgment of Basten JA, which I have read in draft. Pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), the applicant seeks review of the decision of Whitford DCJ on an appeal brought before him, under s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), against the applicant’s conviction of four offences by a magistrate in the Local Court. Such an appeal is expressed, in s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act, to be “by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”. The applicant claims in this proceeding that Whitford DCJ failed to discharge his function, which required him to make an independent assessment of whether the prosecution had proved, to the criminal standard, the applicant’s guilt of the offences.
	


Background


	
	In August 2013 the applicant was charged in the Local Court in Lismore with four counts of sexual offences allegedly committed over a period in 2010 and 2012. Three of the charges named his step-daughter (to whom I will refer as “G”) as complainant; the fourth named G’s niece (the applicant’s step-granddaughter, to whom I will refer as “S”) as complainant. Notwithstanding their familial relationship, G and S are of similar age, G having been born in February 2002, S in October 2001.
	
	
	Evidence and submissions in the proceedings in the Local Court took place over six non-consecutive days between August and November 2013. The evidence in chief of the complainants was given, pursuant to s 306S of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), by way of video recordings of interviews they gave to police during the course of the investigation that took place following their disclosure of the offences. The complainants were cross-examined. In the course of the cross-examination, it was suggested that the complainants had been motivated to fabricate their evidence because the applicant’s relationship with his wife (G’s mother and S’s grandmother) had broken down and there were financial issues.
	
	
	In a preliminary hearing the magistrate ruled that tendency evidence would be admitted in accordance with s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). However, she later reversed that ruling, and did not allow the prosecution to rely on tendency reasoning.
	
	
	The applicant was legally represented in the proceedings. He gave evidence in the hearing.
	
	
	One issue that needs to be noted here arose during the course of the proceedings. This related to one of the counts in respect of which G was the complainant. On the first day of the hearing the Crown amended the charge (which had initially stated a range of dates between which the offence was alleged to have been committed) to allege that the offence was committed on 4 February 2012 (which was pinpointed by reference to its relationship to G’s birthday). The applicant produced documentary evidence that, he claimed, established that he had been interstate on that date.
	


The judgment of the Local Court


	
	After hearing evidence and the submissions of the parties, the magistrate convicted the applicant on all four counts. She gave lengthy reasons for doing so. With respect to the count as to which the applicant had raised an alibi defence, she held:
	


“Was it the Friday, was it the Saturday, my view [is] it does not matter, it really does not matter. I do not consider time to be of the essence and in this circumstance a misstatement of the date in these circumstances will not in my view vitiate the finding of guilt …”


	
	Her Honour placed considerable emphasis on her observations of G’s video recorded interview, which, she said, she had watched a number of times. With respect to G, she said (inter alia):
	


“Having watched her on the video and I have watched that video a number of times in chambers as I was considering this matter, she struck me as a charming, outgoing, vivacious, endearing child.

That alone does not mean that I believe her …

…

I will say at the outset that I believed her without hesitation, I will explain my reasons for that and I think it is very important for me to set out very clearly why I believed her, clearly that is part of my obligation as a finder of fact … She was speaking with body language in the interview and demeanour. The words she used merely corroborated the way she was expressing herself both with her hands, with her legs, with her face.

…

I have watched the video a number of times and each time I am firmed in my view as to her reliability and credit …”

She referred at length to the cross-examination of G, but her previously expressed view of G’s reliability was not altered.


	
	She gave different reasons for accepting the evidence of S, referring extensively to defence submissions that S was confused and her evidence inconsistent; essentially, her Honour rejected these submissions. She expressly rejected the motive to fabricate evidence advanced on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	She referred to the applicant’s evidence, noting that he had denied all allegations, and observed:
	


“True it is an accused in these circumstances can do little more than simply deny the allegations. I agree that it is incredibly difficult for an accused to defend these sorts of allegations particularly where they are fairly general in nature other than to say but I did not do it.”

Although she plainly rejected the applicant’s evidence, her Honour did not make any demeanour based findings. Her assessment was on the basis of a balancing of competing evidence and submissions.

The appeal to the District Court


	
	Pursuant to s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act, the applicant appealed to the District Court. The appeal came before Whitford DCJ on 23 and 24 September 2014. Although s 18(2) and s 19(1) of the Appeal and Review Act make provision, respectively, for fresh evidence to be given (by leave), and for the District Court (in specified and limited circumstances) to direct a person to attend and give evidence, no application under either provision was made, and the appeal proceeded on the basis of the evidence given in the Local Court.
	
	
	Lengthy written and oral submissions were made. The written submissions included a list of 12 asserted errors in the judgment of the magistrate. These can be refined to:
	


(i)  the admission of the tendency evidence in the Local Court (even though that reasoning process was subsequently excluded. The ruling was relied upon to support a contention that the magistrate had made a favourable assessment of the complainants’ evidence and its probity before she heard their testimony);

(ii)  that the magistrate formed an opinion favourable to the complainants without considering the evidence of the applicant;

(iii)  the manner in which the magistrate treated the alibi defence;

(iv)  the manner in which her Honour dealt with evidence adduced on behalf of the applicant concerning the alleged motive for the complainants to make false allegations;

(v)  prejudgment by the magistrate;

(vi)  undue allowance allegedly made for the youth of the complainants;

(vii)  exclusion of cross-examination under s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act.


	
	A further submission was made under the heading “Deficiencies in the evidence [in the Local Court]”, under which a lengthy list of such asserted deficiencies was made.
	
	
	Senior counsel who represented the applicant spoke at some length, in oral submissions, to the submissions already made in writing. A significant part of the address was directed to the argument that the magistrate had “pre-judged” the issues, because of the favourable view she had formed of the complainants, particularly G. He invited the judge to view the video recordings of the interviews with the complainants. He reminded the judge that:
	


“… your Honour will have to make your Honour’s judicial mind up in relation to the evidence as a whole anyway.”

During his oral address, senior counsel made the following submissions:

“… your Honour has the denial of the appellant in circumstances where his evidence wasn’t suggested as evidence to be unpersuasive, to have within it the problems that one often associates with the assessment of evidence, conflicts, contradictions, hesitations, non-responsive answers, all those sorts of things.

So you have a case where at the end of the day and the prosecution hasn’t discharged the alibi evidence, hasn’t discharged its onus with respect to alibi and your Honour has the problems in relation to the changing of the dates and matters of that kind.

So at the end of the day, taking a broad approach to this your Honour would be left with a reasonable doubt in relation to the allegations.”

The judgment of the District Court


	
	With respect to the written submissions, Whitford DCJ is recorded as saying:
	


“Without wishing to do them any injustice or discourtesy by describing them in the following summary way, they were divided into two primary categories or aspects. The first aspect concerned the identification of what was submitted to be errors of the Magistrate in the conduct of the hearing or, more particularly, in her reasons and the exposure of her reasoning processes. Some 12 discreet [sic - discrete] errors were nominated, but there was a high degree of duplication and repetition among them, such that many of them might be described as alternate particularisations of the same errors.

The second aspect of the submissions was directed to identifying parts of the evidence, in particular the evidence of the two complainants, which it was submitted would cause such disquiet in respect of the result as to warrant allowing the appeal and setting aside the convictions.”


	
	His Honour then discerned “three principal categories” of the applicant’s submissions, as follows:
	


“The first category of error might loosely be described as errors of prejudgment - which embraces a number of corresponding particulars and concerns relating both to the asserted inadequacy of her Honour’s fact finding or the expression of her reasons for her findings and the inadequacy of the evidence, particularly the evidence of the complainants, to serve as a foundation for her findings;

The second category of error, closely related to the first, concerns the evidence of [G’s mother] leaving home suddenly and the use which it is asserted her Honour made of that evidence;

The third category relates to some evidence adduced by the appellant concerning an alibi for the [4 February] offence and her Honour’s treatment of that evidence, particularly in light of the amended charge.”

His Honour then proceeded to deal at length with each of the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant.


	
	He rejected the contention that the magistrate had prejudged the issue, finding that she had “gone to great lengths to expose the matters that persuaded her to her ultimate acceptance of the complainants beyond reasonable doubt”. With respect to the argument concerning her assessment of G’s credibility, he said:
	


“Again, I cannot accept that this criticism of her Honour’s approach is fairly made … Frankly, having seen the interviews of the girls, I see no reason why the matters that her Honour took into account were not available to her Honour as matters persuasive of the credibility and reliability of the complainants.”


	
	He found that the magistrate had adequately directed herself with respect to the task of fact finding.
	
	
	He turned to a submission that her Honour did not “expose any reasoning process for rejection of [the applicant’s] evidence”. As to that, he said:
	


“Certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it may have been preferable if the magistrate had made some express observations concerning the basis for the rejection of [the applicant’s] evidence. It is implicit, however, in the way her Honour approached the task that she was acutely conscious that she must acquit unless she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the complainant’s evidence. And it follows from an assessment of the whole of her reasons that there was nothing arising from the evidence of [the applicant], either in its content, or the way it was given, which gives rise to reasonable doubt.”


	
	He then said:
	


“In adjudicating on this appeal, I am acutely conscious of the natural limitations that exist in approaching an appeal based substantially on the record below … Those limitations of course include the disadvantage which I have, relative to the Magistrate, in respect of the evaluation of witnesses and in respect of the opportunity she had over quite a lengthy interval, to reflect upon the evidence and draw conclusions from it. The submission was made that the Magistrate’s advantage is mitigated on the appeal because I have had access to and viewed the evidence in chief of the two complainants.

I have seen the interviews of each of the complainants. I have not, however, had the advantage of seeing or hearing any of the other witnesses including the appellant (other than through viewing his recorded interview), nor of seeing or hearing the crossexaminations of the complainants.

…

The resolution of most of those matters, in particular in connection with the various identified deficiencies of the evidence of [G] and [S], depends upon the unique benefit the Magistrate had of seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence and making corresponding assessments of what and whom to believe. Those assessments frequently depend on subtleties which simply cannot adequately be taken into account of [sic] by resort only to a transcript, even when it is partially supplemented by some recorded evidence. Those assessments require an understanding of the dynamics of the hearing, and the close observation of witnesses. Her Honour, at least in respect of exposing why she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of the complainants, went to considerable lengths to expose those matters that informed her assessment.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the 4 February count, in respect of which the applicant raised an alibi defence. He considered that the magistrate’s conclusion that “I do not consider time to be of the essence” was contrary to the effect of the amendment by the Crown to the charge, in which it specified 4 February as the date of the offence. He said that the magistrate “read and determined the charge as though it read ‘on or around’ 4 February”. He considered that the reasonable possibility that the applicant had been interstate on 4 February 2012:
	


“… gives rise to sufficient doubt that the appropriate verdict on [that] charge, in the absence of any evidence displacing that possibility, was not guilty.”

He then rejected the proposition that that conclusion would have an impact upon the assessment of the credibility of the complainants with respect to the other counts. He concluded:

“Approaching each charge separately, as one must, it flows from everything her Honour said concerning her reasons for accepting that complainant that the nomination of the 4th of February by the complainant would not have been attributed by the Magistrate to deliberate dishonesty on the part of the complainant. That accords with my assessment of the whole of the evidence too, appreciating all the limitations I have referred to in an appeal of this character. Accordingly, for the reasons I have outlined earlier, extending to the appellant the benefit of the doubt in respect of [the 4 February count], does not justify any disturbance of her Honour’s findings in respect of the other counts or any different result on this appeal in respect of the other charges.” (italics added)


	
	He set aside the conviction with respect to the 4 February 2012 count, and confirmed the convictions on the remaining three counts.
	


The application to this Court


	
	The application to this Court is for judicial review of the decision of the District Court. The grounds advanced are:
	


“1.  His Honour erred in that he misconceived his jurisdiction and acted contrary to the provisions of s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act NSW 2001 in that he failed to treat the appeal as a rehearing and limited his judgment to identifying error on the part of the Magistrate.

2.  His Honour erred in failing to undertake his own independent assessment and analysis of the evidence presented in the Local Court and thereby failing to form his own judgment of the facts.

3.  His Honour failed to give any or sufficient consideration or analysis of the evidence of the two complainants [G] and [S], which he acknowledged from the [applicant’s] submissions if accepted, would cause such disquiet as to warrant setting aside the conviction.

4.  His Honour erred in finding that the error in the Magistrate’s reasoning in respect of alibi did not cast doubt on the evidence of the complainant [G], even though he dismissed [that charge].”


	
	Written submissions filed in support of the application followed the tenor of the grounds. They included:
	


“24  The District Court failed to apply the relevant principles governing a conviction appeal from the Local Court pursuant to s 18(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act NSW (2001).

25  The Court did not embark on its fundamental duty of ‘rehearing’ the case on the Local Court transcripts, supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court.

…

27  The District Court did not form its own judgment of the facts so far as it was able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the Magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court …

28  The approach taken by the District court was essentially an adoption and defence of the Magistrate’s finding without considering for itself the relevant issues raised in the Local Court hearing …”

The balance of the written submissions (and the oral submissions) was, essentially, an explication of these assertions.


	
	Section 18(1) of the Appeal and Review Act is explicit that an appeal under s 11 is to be by way of rehearing; and (unless leave is granted under sub-s (2) to adduce fresh evidence, or the District Court directs, in accordance with s 19(1), that oral evidence be given) is to be conducted on the basis of evidence given in the Local Court proceedings. What s 18(1) is not explicit about is the precise nature of the rehearing, and the task of the District Court judge hearing the appeal.
	
	
	The central legal proposition in the applicant’s submissions is that s 11 (read with s 18) confers powers that may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. The obligation of the District Court judge is to bring to bear an independent judgment on the question of whether the prosecution has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt of the person accused. An appeal under s 11 is therefore not limited to the identification of error in the Local Court, and is not determined simply by concluding that no error has been demonstrated on the part of the Local Court magistrate. (Nor is the exercise of the powers granted by s 20(1)(b) of the Appeal and Review Act dependent upon the identification of error.)
	
	
	The submissions of both parties proceeded on this basis. No argument was directed to the proposition that, because the appeal is by way of rehearing, it is necessary that the appellant demonstrate error at first instance. However, since Basten JA (if I understand his Honour’s judgment correctly) has taken the view that error must be demonstrated, and since I have (tentatively, as the question was not argued) come to a contrary view, it is appropriate that I explain my reasons, conscious that they must be tentative.
	


The legislation and relevant authority


	
	In order to explain the issues, it is necessary to set out some provisions of the Appeal and Review Act:
	


“11  Appeals as of right

(1)  Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence (or both).

(1A)  …

(1B)  …

(2)  …

18  Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence

(1)  An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.

(2)  Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.

(3)  …

19  Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person

(1)  The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:

(a)  in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or

(b)  in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence.

(2)  …

(3)  …

(4)  …

(5)  …

(6)  …

20  Determination of appeals

(1)  The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction:

(a)  by setting aside the conviction, or

(b)  by dismissing the appeal, or

(c)  in the case of an appeal made with leave under section 12 (1)—by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with any directions of the District Court.

(2)  …”

(Section 12(1) concerns convictions entered in the absence of the defendant, and convictions entered following pleas of guilty, and is not here relevant.)


	
	It is to be observed that the powers of the District Court specified in s 20 do not include a power to remit the proceedings, for further hearing, to the Local Court. That is, in my opinion, of some significance.
	
	
	In Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; 203 CLR 172, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in a joint judgment identified three kinds of appeal:
	


(i)  appeals “in the strict sense”;

(ii)  appeals by way of rehearing;

(iii)  appeals by way of hearing de novo.

(Their Honours identified “appeals in the strict sense” as those in which the appellate court is empowered only to give the decision which should have been given at first instance. Appeals of that kind are of no present relevance.)

Their Honours distinguished appeals of the second and third kind in the following passage:

“23  For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error.” (internal citation omitted)

But, immediately after that characterisation, they went on to say:

“At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance.”


	
	It is clear that appeals under s 11 are not “appeals in the strict sense”; it is equally clear that they are not appeals by way of hearing de novo. The present question is whether these are appeals that require the identification of error, as defined in Allesch, or whether the terms of the Appeal and Review Act indicate that the powers conferred on the District Court may be exercised regardless of error.
	
	
	The authority cited for the proposition that an appeal by way of rehearing might not be confined to identification of error was Re Coldham; Ex parte Brideson (No 2) [1990] HCA 36; 170 CLR 267. The relevant statute in that case was s 88F of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) which provided for appeals from a Registrar of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to the Commission. Leave was required to appeal; where leave was granted, by sub-s (3) the Commission was empowered to take further evidence. The statute did not otherwise specify the nature of the appeal. By sub-s (4) the Commission was empowered to confirm, quash or vary a decision against which an appeal was brought. The High Court (constituted by Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) considered that the provisions of sub-s (3) and sub-s (4) were strong indications that the appeal was to be by way of rehearing. Nevertheless, the Court did not find that the appellate jurisdiction could be exercised only after the identification of error. Rather, the Court held:
	


“17  … upon the correct construction of s 88F, the Commission was bound to make its own decision on the evidence before it …”

Their Honours cited Federated Carters’ and Drivers’ Industrial Union of Australia v Motor Transport and Chauffeurs’ Association of Australia (1912) 6 CAR 122, in which Higgins J said of the same appeal provision:

“The appellant is entitled to have ... a re-hearing, a ‘review’ of the decision ... He is entitled to such judgment as I can bring to bear upon the question, independently of the Registrar, although, of course, I should attach a good deal of weight to the Registrar’s view.”

The Court went on:

“But once leave was granted, the Commission was bound to make its own decision on the evidence before it, including any further evidence admitted pursuant to s 88F(3).”


	
	The citation in Allesch of Brideson (No 2) denotes acceptance that the power to take further evidence and the power to confirm, quash or vary a decision are indicators that the appeal (although said to be by way of rehearing) did not depend upon identification of error.
	
	
	The conclusion in Brideson (No 2) is also consistent with what was said by Windeyer J in Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Ltd [1970] HCA 43; 124 CLR 192 at 208-9 as follows:
	


“The rule referred to … provides that all appeals shall be ‘by way of rehearing’. This does not mean that the appeal is a complete rehearing as a new trial is. It means that the case is to be determined by the Full Court, its members considering for themselves the issues the trial judge had to determine and the effect of the evidence he heard as appearing in the record of the proceedings before him, but applying the law as it is when the appeal is heard not as it was when the trial occurred … [The relevant rule] provides too that the Full Court shall have power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and to make any order that ought to have been made. This is more or less standard form. It confers a wide power. But it does not I think curtail the recognition or respect that an appeal court should accord to the decision of a trial judge.”


	
	There is nothing in either Brideson (No 2) or in the Federated Carters’ and Drivers’ case that calls for the identification of specific error before the obligation for the appellate court to exercise independent judgment arises.
	
	
	On these authorities, I would conclude that it is not necessary, before the appellate power of the District Court is exercised, that error of law, fact or discretion be shown.
	
	
	Authorities in this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal are, however, not so easy to reconcile.
	
	
	In Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; 65 NSWLR 539 the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that the Appeal and Review Act did indicate that the powers of the District Court could be exercised regardless of error. At least part of the reason for this was the absence of any statutory power to remit the proceedings to the Local Court.
	
	
	But, in Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92, Gleeson JA, with whom Ward JA and Johnson J agreed, said:
	


“28  As the appeal to the District Court is by way of rehearing, it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that the order the subject of the appeal is the result of a legal, factual or discretionary error in which event the District Court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and law as they then stand. Accordingly, it was the duty of [the District Court judges] to form their own judgment of the facts and, in particular, to determine whether the evidence before the Magistrates was sufficient to demonstrate Mr Mulder’s guilt on the charges beyond reasonable doubt.” (italics added, internal citations omitted)

Allesch and Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52 were cited as authority for the proposition contained in the first sentence. On one reading of this passage (see the words italicised), the obligation, and, indeed, the power, of the District Court to form its own view of the facts and law depends upon an anterior finding of error. However, closer analysis of what was decided in that case suggests that this was not the approach actually taken. It is necessary to examine the relevant facts.


	
	Mr Mulder faced two separate prosecutions of federal offences in the Local Court. On each occasion, he was convicted, and on each occasion, he appealed under s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act to the District Court. Each appeal was dismissed. Mr Mulder applied to this Court for judicial review of the decisions.
	
	
	Mr Mulder’s first appeal came before Hock DCJ. As recorded in the judgment of this Court ([62]-[68]) her Honour independently considered the evidence in the Local Court, and declared herself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the charges had been proved.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that, before proceeding to make that assessment, Hock DCJ had identified any error in the judgment of the magistrate from whom the appeal was brought. Nor was there any suggestion in the judgment of this Court that it was either wrong or unnecessary, in the absence of identified error, for Hock DCJ to have embarked on her independent judgment.
	
	
	Mr Mulder’s second appeal came before Toner DCJ. Again, the judgment of this Court shows that, like Hock DCJ, his Honour made an independent and comprehensive analysis of the evidence in the Local Court, and reached the same conclusion as the magistrate - that is, that Mr Mulder was guilty of the offences with which he was charged. Again, there was no suggestion that, before embarking on that exercise his Honour found any error of law, fact or discretion, and no suggestion in this Court that it was therefore wrong or unnecessary for Toner DCJ to take that course.
	
	
	I should note here that it makes no difference that, in each case, the District Court upheld the decision of the magistrate. It is the process - of decision-making by the appellate judge - that is relevant. If it were correct that a s 11 appeal depended upon identification of error in the Local Court, then, absent some identification of error, it would have been inappropriate for Hock DCJ and Toner DCJ to have proceeded to the final exercise of determination of guilt. The appropriate order in each case would, in that circumstance, have been dismissal of the appeal, without engagement with the facts, or the inferences to be drawn from them.
	
	
	In Dyason, judicial review was sought and granted in respect of an appeal under s 11 against the making, in the Local Court, of an Apprehended Personal Violence Order under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). The matter was remitted to the District Court for hearing and determination according to law, on the basis that:
	


“70  It is apparent from the primary judgment that the primary judge did not, with respect, form her own judgment as to the facts and whether they warranted the conclusion that the elements of s 19(1)(b)(i) of the DPV Act (relating to intimidation) had been established … Nor did her Honour address the sufficiency issue s 19(1) directed the decision-maker to consider once a prima facie s 19(1)(b) finding had been made. Finally her Honour did not consider whether, in all the circumstances, and taking into account the matters raised in s 20, an APVO was warranted.

71  Further, in determining that the Magistrate’s orders should be confirmed, the primary judge did not examine the evidence before the Magistrate, nor did she consider whether his Honour had adequately identified and dealt with the matters with which he was required to deal …”


	
	I read the second of these paragraphs as a clear statement that the jurisdictional error of the District Court judge was to fail to consider whether error on the part of the magistrate had been established. The first, however, is consistent with that contrary proposition, that the powers of the District Court are exercisable regardless of error, and on the basis of the District Court judge’s own assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	In an earlier decision, in the Court of Criminal Appeal, (Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; 164 A Crim R 39) Mason P reached the conclusion that, on a rehearing, the appellate court is, essentially, to undertake the exercise that was required of the first instance tribunal. That suggests to me that exercise of the appellate power does not depend on a finding of error. Additional comments made by Mason P highlight the difficulties that are inherent in the discharge of that jurisdiction when the task is to be undertaken on the record of the first instance hearing, without the appellate judge having the benefit of observing the witnesses. That, however, did not alter the role of the appellate court; it called for recognition that respect is to be paid to, for example, the original court’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses (see the last sentence in the passage from Da Costa extracted above, the whole of which was quoted in Charara). Mason P said:
	


“17  The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (s 18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (s 18(2)).

18  The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court [citations omitted].

19  The nature of an appeal ‘by way of rehearing’ has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must first be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear. ‘The ‘rehearing’ does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence.  That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits’ … Referring to the ‘requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal’, their Honours continued (at [23], footnotes omitted):

… On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to ‘give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance’.  On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record.  These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share.  Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.” (italics in original)

The quotations in italics are taken from the decision of the High Court in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118.


	
	Confirmation of the view I have expressed is to be found in the following circumstance. At the time Charara was decided, s 18(1) was in a different form. It then provided:
	


“(1)  An appeal against conviction is to be way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by s 19.” (italics added)


	
	Of s 18 as it then stood, Mason P said:
	


“23  District Court judges traditionally and understandably refrained from reading the reasons of the Local Court when the appeal was do novo. But the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript indicates to me that this approach is no longer justified. The magistrate’s reasons are not part of the ‘certified transcripts of evidence’ referred to in s 18(1) any more than the exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Nevertheless, as I see it, the District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them.

24  The Local Court reasons will doubtless include an explanation why the conviction was entered at first instance, including an assessment of the credibility issues touching any factual dispute. Without reference to the reasons the District Court would be driven to speculation or deciding the issue entirely afresh. Neither such course would be consonant with the statutory scheme …”


	
	These observations were considered by the Attorney General’s Department of the NSW Government in a “Report on the Statutory Review of the [Appeal and Review] Act” in August 2008. The authors of the Report wrote:
	


“The requirement that appeals be dealt with by way of a rehearing on transcripts of evidence limits the material from the original hearing that may be before the District Court. If narrowly construed, it suggests that the District Court is unable to rely on exhibits before the magistrate in the Local Court without giving leave. Similarly, other material such as the reasons given by the magistrate, that does not constitute evidence, are not included in the transcripts of evidence.

The District Court is at a disadvantage rehearing the proceedings without the benefit of seeing or hearing the witnesses.

…

Assessments by the magistrate on issues of credibility would provide the District Court with a greater understanding of the conduct of the case and the decision made in the original proceedings. The comments by Mason J [sic – Mason P] in Charara recognise that it is consistent with the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing that the reasons given by the magistrate be available to reduce these ‘natural limitations’.”

It was, accordingly, recommended that the Parliament:

“Amend the Act to provide that an appeal to the District Court … against conviction and sentence is to be a rehearing on the basis of the transcript of the proceedings and other material before the original Local Court.”


	
	It was after that that s 18 was amended to its present form.
	
	
	It is implicit in the Report and the recommendation (and the enactment in conformity with the recommendation) that the intention was that the District Court judge would exercise an independent judgment of the guilt of the accused, aided (in the absence of the opportunity to observe witnesses and make his or her own credibility assessment) by the credibility findings of the magistrate.
	


Resolution


	
	I therefore proceed to consider the matters raised on behalf of the applicant on the basis that the obligation of Whitford DCJ was to form his own judgment as to the facts and whether they warranted the conclusion - his conclusion - that the applicant was guilty of the charges of which he had been convicted. It was not necessary that legal, factual or discretionary error be established.
	
	
	The fundamental task of a court is to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it, with the important proviso that that task is to be undertaken on the basis of the issues presented to the court for determination. That is precisely what Whitford DCJ did.
	
	
	He first dealt with and disposed of the many errors it was asserted characterised the decision of the magistrate. The assertion of error had occupied the vast bulk of the written submissions, as well as of the oral submissions. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the vast bulk of the judgment also was devoted to those matters. The grounds of the application to this Court did not challenge any of the findings that resulted from that exercise. The complaints contained in Grounds 1 to 3 of the application to this Court are, essentially, that his Honour did not undertake the necessary task of evaluating the evidence for himself. (Ground 4 is an assertion of error in his Honour’s approach to the consequences of his finding error in the magistrate’s treatment of the alibi evidence. Such a complaint is not available under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act.)
	
	
	In respect of the credibility findings concerning the complainants, his Honour was necessarily limited to reliance on the findings of the magistrate, supplemented by the advantage he had in viewing the video recorded interviews, and his analysis of asserted deficiencies in their evidence. He was necessarily so limited by the provisions of s 18 and s 19, confining the circumstances in which fresh or additional evidence may be given. It is a necessary consequence of those provisions that credibility findings of a Local Court are an important resource in the exercise of the s 11 jurisdiction. The last sentence in the passage extracted above from Da Costa confirms that, on an appeal by way of rehearing, credibility assessments by the first instance tribunal are to be accorded due weight. That is made explicit in the passage from Fox v Percy quoted in Charara.
	
	
	Within those limits, Whitford DCJ undertook the task of making his own judgment of the facts, and of whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the applicant. His decision to set aside the conviction on one count is a particularly strong indication, if more were needed, that he exercised the independent judgment that was required of him. The exercise of that judgment culminated in his endorsement of the assessment of the evidence by the magistrate.
	
	
	For these reasons, I agree with Basten JA that the summons should be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	SACKVILLE AJA: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA.
	
	
	It is surprising that the precise nature of the rehearing on an appeal to the District Court pursuant to s 11(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (Appeal and Review Act) is apparently not yet settled. The judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA show that the statutory scheme for appeals to the District Court against convictions in the Local Court presents a number of inter-related questions of construction. Among these is the question of whether the District Court has an implied power to remit a matter to the Local Court and, if not, whether the omission suggests that an appeal to that Court is not limited to the identification of error.
	
	
	The issues of construction canvassed in the judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA were not the subject of full argument on the application for judicial review. Their Honours’ judgments indicate that regardless of which of the competing constructions (assuming they are the only alternatives) is correct, the application must be dismissed. I prefer not to express an opinion on the question of construction until it is necessary to do so.
	
	
	I add the following observations on what I understood to be the principal argument advanced on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions in this Court were not closely tailored to the requirement that jurisdictional error must be established in order for the Court to intervene. Nonetheless, I understood Mr Bellanto QC, who appeared with Mr Hodgson for the applicant, to submit that the District Court Judge failed to address an argument put to him and thus fell into jurisdictional error. The particular argument that was not addressed, so Mr Bellanto submitted, was that the Magistrate considered only the veracity of the complainants’ evidence and did not give proper consideration to the applicant’s evidence in determining whether the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is true that an argument was advanced in the District Court that the Magistrate made no findings as to the applicant’s demeanour and provided no explanation as to why the applicant’s denial of wrongdoing did not create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If the District Court Judge overlooked this argument on the appeal, his Honour may well have constructively failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by ss 11 and 20 of the Appeal and Review Act.
	
	
	The District Court Judge expressly referred to the submissions that the Magistrate did not expose any reasoning process for rejecting the applicant’s evidence. His Honour rejected the submission for these reasons: [54] 
	


“Certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it may have been preferable if the Magistrate had made some express observations concerning the basis for the rejection of the appellant’s evidence. It is implicit, however, in the way her Honour approached the task that she was acutely conscious that she must acquit unless she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the complainant’s evidence. And it follows from an assessment of the whole of her reasons that there was nothing arising from the evidence of the appellant, either in its content, or the way it was given, which gives rise to reasonable doubt.”

In the passage set out in Basten JA’s judgment, [55]  the District Court Judge went on to explain why he did not think a basis had been established for overturning the findings made by the Magistrate.


	
	In my view, the District Court Judge did not overlook or fail to consider the argument identified by Mr Bellanto. Whether his Honour was correct in rejecting the argument is not a matter that arises on the present application. It follows that his Honour did not fall into jurisdictional error in the manner contended for by Mr Bellanto.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA and Simpson JA that the appellant has not established any other jurisdictional error on the part of the District Court Judge.

      The appellants’ were serving police officers and members of the NSW Armed Hold-up Squad in 1991. They participated in an operation carried out at the Hilton Hotel in response to information received about an armed robbery that was planned to occur in the early hours of 22 July 1991. The offenders had secreted themselves within the hotel’s false ceiling. The appellants’ role was to man a listening post in the hotel and report the presence of the offenders. The respondent’s plan was to have members of the State Protection Group (SPG) present to engage in any confrontation with the offenders. The planning of the operation took into account the presence of a large number of patrons at Juliana’s nightclub within the vicinity of the relevant area of the hotel, which was to close at approximately 3am. The plan did not envisage that the SPG would arrive at the hotel until after the nightclub closed. 
       
       
      At 1.05am the appellants detected sounds of movement in the ceiling. The SPG was informed. 
       
       
      Prior to the arrival of the SPG (and at about 2.15am) an alarm sounded within the hotel in response to the offenders having fallen through the false ceiling within which they were hiding. The appellants left the listening post and became engaged in a violent confrontation with the offenders. The appellant McDonald was shot in the arm and seeks damages accordingly. All three appellant’s seek damages for nervous shock and psychiatric injury. The three cases were pleaded identically and on appeal the appellants sought to amend a particular within their Statements of Claim. 
       
       
      Held per Meagher, Stein JJA and Davies AJA: 
       
       
      1. The respondent is not prejudiced by the inclusion of the failure of the respondent to ensure the protection of the appellants in the pleadings. A duty to protect is an extension of a duty to evacuate the appellants and the evidence required to address the issue was called at trial. The amendment sought by the appellants to their Statements of Claim is granted. 
       
       
      2. The operational plan was fundamentally deficient. It made no allowance for the foreseeable possibility that the tactical phase of the operation may commence prior to the arrival of the SPG. Due to the fragile nature of the false ceiling it should have been appreciated that the offenders might fall through the roof at any time after they entered the space. The failure of the plan to provide for such a contingency placed the appellants, and indeed the public, at risk. 
       
       
      3. The plan made no provision for the protection of the appellants if the offenders descended from the ceiling prior to the arrival of the SPG. A plan which did provide protection for the appellants had previously been envisaged. It was both necessary and feasible to provide the respondents with protection. 
       
       
      4. The duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to members of the police service is in no way distinguishable from that owed by any other employer to its employees.

      5. There was a clear breach of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellants. This breach caused the injuries suffered by the respondents.  
       
       
      Orders: 
       
       
      1 Appeals allowed with costs. 
       
       
      2 Judgment and orders in favour of the respondent be set aside. 
       
       
      3 Judgment on the issue of liability in favour of the appellants be substituted therefor. 
       
       
      4 The respondent be ordered to pay the appellants’ costs in the Court below.

     1    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
     2    STEIN JA: 
      
      Introduction 
     3    These are three appeals from a judgment of Gibb DCJ delivered in the District Court on 14 April 2000. Her Honour dismissed claims for damages brought by three police officers arising out of injuries received in and arising out of an altercation with two armed would-be offenders during an attempted robbery of the Hilton Hotel, Sydney on 22 July 1991.  
      
      Facts 
     4    In July 1991 the three appellants were New South Wales police officers and members of the Armed Hold-Up Squad. Edward Shepherd and Craig McDonald held the rank of Detective Sergeant, and Mark Wilson was the junior of the three, being a Detective Senior Constable. All were experienced officers. Their damages claims arose out of an operation which was supposed to be carried out in the early hours of 22 July 1991 at the Hilton Hotel, Pitt Street, Sydney. 5    Information had been received by Shepherd and the Armed Hold-Up Squad about an intended robbery of the hotel. The robbery was to be a repeat of one carried out on 2 April 1991 by the same offenders, where approximately $300,000 had been stolen from the hotel strongroom. 6    The two would-be offenders were identified by the informant as being Mr Taousanis and Mr Fred Massih. They were known by police to be dangerous. The appellant McDonald described Taousanis as a ‘vicious cunning criminal’. The appellant Shepherd knew Taousanis to be a ‘very dangerous criminal prepared to shoot at police, heavily armed, ex commando, trained in weapons, very skilful in the use of guns, very dangerous. Also that he was responsible although never charged with a number of murders’. The appellant Wilson was also aware of Taousanis’ ‘violent propensities’, as well as having made inquiries about Massih a few days prior to the operation. 7    According to the information received, the offenders’ plan was to gain access into a false ceiling at a point in or near the foyer on level 7 of the hotel, during the night or early morning. The false ceiling was located two to three feet below the solid concrete ceiling between levels 7 and 8. The ceiling was described in evidence by Mr Geoffrey Walburn, the hotel’s security manager, as being ‘made up with a layer of steel frame and I suppose the best way to describe them would be similar to a compressed cardboard tiles that insulate for sound and temperature and they sit within the frame’. The offenders intended, once they were secreted within the false ceiling, to crawl along until they were above the strongroom. Safes were located in the strongroom. They intended to wait until sometime after 8.30 am on the following day, when staff would attend to business as usual and the hotel safes would be opened. As police understood the plan, the offenders would then drop from the ceiling and commit the armed robbery. 8    A police operation was planned in response to the information received about the plan by Taousanis and Massih to rob the hotel. The planning of Operation Hilton, as it became known, fell into several phases. After the Armed Hold-Up Squad received the initial information, they called for assistance from the newly formed State Protection Group (the SPG), which was responsible for the tactical planning of the operation, including any confrontation with or arrest of the offenders. Once the offenders were arrested, the SPG’s role would end, and the Armed Hold-Up Squad would take over the process of interviewing the offenders. 9    The appellants’ instructions with respect to the operation were that they were to run the listening post, located on the same floor as the strongroom, but out of line of sight. The appellants were directed that the operation would be completed under the control of the SPG and that they were to ‘take no active part whatsoever in any confrontation with the offenders’. Superintendent Harding’s evidence was that Assistant Commissioner Gibson had directed that any confrontation with the offenders was to be carried out by properly equipped members of the SPG. Harding indicated that members of the SPG would be in a position to supply support and protection for the appellants. The appellants were not given any specific instructions on what course of action they should take if the offenders left the ceiling space prior to the planned commencement of the tactical operation by the SPG, that is, prior to the arrival of SPG officers at the hotel.10    The operation was complicated by the close proximity in the hotel of Juliana’s nightclub to the robbery target, the strongroom. The entrance to the nightclub was situated ‘next to the room the police were using [as a listening post] and … virtually behind that room’. On the night in question there was a private function for about 200 people in the nightclub, which was not expected to end until about 3 am. A hotel security officer was to be posted on the door of the nightclub so that when patrons were leaving, they were directed out through the fire exit so as to avoid the lobby area of the hotel. These arrangements were in place from about 11.30 pm or midnight onwards on the night.  
     11    The protection of the public was clearly considered to be a major consideration in the development of the tactical plan. The Operational Orders (prepared by the SPG) did not expressly specify any time frame for the apprehension of the would-be offenders. However, time constraints were imposed by external factors, including the operation of the nightclub and the availability of SPG personnel. The timing of the tactical plan was described at the trial by Detective Inspector Hazzard, who was in charge of the operation, as follows:  
      
       
        
        … some time after 3 o’clock on the Sunday morning, which would be after … Juliana’s… was closed… we would secure the area by placing a perimeter around it, and ensure that the premises were evacuated from anyone not involved in the operation, and we would make contact with the offenders… and request them to surrender. And, if they failed to do so, we would use other resources to flush them from their position.  
        
       
       
        
       
     12    A number of other internal police reports noted that the operation was not expected to take place until between 3.30 and 5.30 am, when there would be no danger to members of the public.13    Her Honour found that there was no direction contained in the plan that members of the SPG were to be present in the listening post or at the hotel at any time prior to the planned start of the tactical operation. It was nonetheless directed by Gibson that any confrontation with the offenders was to be handled by the SPG, and that the group should be in a position to provide support and protection to the appellants. However, it must be emphasised that the plan itself did not involve locating any SPG members at the hotel prior to the planned start time of the tactical operation which, as has been observed, was not scheduled to commence before the closure of the nightclub at approximately 3 am. 14    There were thirty members of the SPG whose task it was to perform the operation. The supervisor for the shift which finished at 11 pm, Sergeant Magnus, wanted those men to stay on for the 11 pm to 7 am shift. There were only six men and a supervisor assigned to the 11 pm to 7 am shift and Magnus was concerned that if the Hilton operation ‘went down’ during that time frame, the group would be left undermanned. Hazzard disagreed with Magnus. Accordingly, the plan was to call out the on-call SPG members from their homes early on the morning in question. The outcome of this decision was that there was a greatly reduced number of SPG members available at the police headquarters in the Remington Centre in Liverpool Street during the night. Magnus alerted Hazzard to the risks if it happened that the tactical aspect of the operation commenced earlier than anticipated. What is important, however, is that there was no provision in the plan for the appellants to be evacuated from the listening post or to be under the protection of the SPG while at their post in the hotel. 15    In these circumstances, it is very difficult to comprehend how the SPG could provide any real protection for the appellants if the would-be robbers commenced their action earlier than 3 am. As mentioned, the three appellants were stationed in their listening post on level 7 of the hotel. Technicians had earlier placed listening devices within the false ceiling where the offenders were planning to gain entry. The listening post was located in the hotel’s ticket office, and the appellants entered the post and began monitoring at about 10.30 pm on 21 July 1991. At 1.05 am on the morning of the 22 July 1991, the appellants detected sounds of movement in the ceiling. Shepherd then telephoned the contact officer (Detective Sergeant Jenkins) at the SPG and reported this. He continued to make periodic reports thereafter as the monitors relayed sounds of the offenders crawling along the false ceiling. 16    At approximately 2.15 am, an alarm sounded within the hotel. A report of the incident later prepared by police states that ‘It appears that the offender/s fell through the fragile ceiling and set off the alarm…’. In response to the alarm, the appellants McDonald and Wilson ran from the listening post towards where the offenders were thought to be hiding. At trial both McDonald and Wilson suggested that they had left the listening post without having been certain that the alarm had been triggered by the offenders. Wilson’s written report in August 1991 conceded that both he and McDonald had ‘commenced to search for the offenders’ after leaving the listening post, although at the hearing they said that, as well as being concerned about the escape of the offenders, they feared for the safety of the public. 17    Wilson described the events which occurred after he and McDonald left the listening post: 
      
       
        
         … We made a search. I made a search of the corridor, the stairwell…I continued back down the corridor in a northerly direction and as I did so I passed Detective McDonald. He said something to me and then I heard him say, “Police, where are you going?” I turned to my left and I saw Jim Taousanis standing adjacent to the … strong room door…. 
         
        As I looked at him he raised his right arm with a revolver in it and as he did so I had my gun at my side and I realised that I wasn’t going to be able to shoot him before he shot me so I dived forward to my right and as I did he fired a number of shots. I landed on the floor… There was more shooting going on. As I hit the floor my gun was knocked out of my hand. 
         
        I tried to get my gun back. I tried to get to my feet, expecting to be shot in the back of the head because I thought Detective McDonald was dead… 
         
        I was face down. I got to the end of the corridor. I saw Detective Shepherd standing adjacent to the [listening post] door.’  
        
       
     18    Upon hearing the alarm, Shepherd telephoned Jenkins at the SPG. He did not immediately follow his two colleagues out of the listening post. Before he completed the call he heard McDonald shout ‘Police: Where are you going?’ He then heard gunfire. At this point he picked up his gun and ran from the listening post. As he left the room he saw Taousanis near the door to the fire escape, at which point Taousanis fired a shot at Shepherd. The shot narrowly passed his left ear. He dived back into the doorway of the listening post, by which time he observed Wilson on his stomach on the floor, and McDonald crouched to the right-hand side of the hallway wall. At that stage Shepherd did not know whether or not his colleagues were alive. When Shepherd stepped out again Taousanis had disappeared. Massih, however, was still present and fired at him from near the fire stair door, a distance of about 20 to 30 metres. Shepherd was able to return fire three times as Massih escaped through the fire stair door. 19    When the shooting had ceased, Shepherd saw that McDonald had been shot in the arm. After a search of the area, the three officers concluded that the offenders had escaped down the stairs and out through Pitt Street. They called for assistance. The offenders were arrested later that day by other police. 20    The appellants allege that the respondent was negligent in a number of respects. In failing to adhere to the original operational plan, and in failing to warn the appellants of the departure from the plan. More specifically, particular of negligence (e) provided: 
      
       
        
        … if, as the plaintiff does not concede, the operational plan did not provide as set out hereunder, failure of the operational plan to require, and of the NSW police service to put into effect, that heavily armed state protection group members  
        evacuate and replace 
         the plaintiff[s] … immediately after sounds of the armed offenders were first detected. [Emphasis added] 
        
       
     21    The appellants seek damages for nervous shock and psychiatric injury, and in the case of McDonald, his physical injury as well. The appellants were jointly represented at both the trial and the appeal, and their cases were heard together. Apart from differences in injuries and damages claimed, their cases are pleaded identically. 
      
       
      The Judgment at first instance 
     22    Gibb DCJ found that there was no failure by the respondent to adhere to the operational plan, no decision not to follow the plan, nor any departure from the plan. Her Honour noted that s 201 of the Police Service Act 1990 expressly required police officers to comply with lawful orders. All three appellants were experienced officers who were aware of the offenders’ dangerous nature and received explicit instructions not to engage with the offenders. However, this did not make it reasonably foreseeable that the appellants would fail to comply with their instructions. 23    Her Honour did not consider the general adequacy of the planning of Operation Hilton, although she noted that it failed. Accepting the benefit of hindsight, the plan was plainly inadequate. It is implicit in her Honour’s findings that the plan was deficient in that it made no provision as to what was to happen if the offenders left the ceiling space prior to the proposed time of the operation. This was clearly a significant omission. In these circumstances, it made no provision for the protection of the appellants, even if they remained at their post. Her Honour accepted the view that the safety of the public was central to the planning and execution of any operation. Hazzard’s testimony to the effect that having heavily armed SPG officers in the hotel prior to the time of confrontation would increase the danger to members of the public was accepted by her Honour.  
     24    Judge Gibb also found that Gibson did not direct that any SPG members should be present at the hotel prior to the start of the tactical operation, that he had ordered that any confrontation which occurred was to be handled by the SPG, and that the group should be in a position to supply support and protection for the appellants. The tactical phase of the operation, she held, was not scheduled to start prior to the closure of Juliana’s nightclub at around 3 am. However, it needs to be emphasised that there was no provision in the plan whereby the SPG could supply support and protection for the appellants prior to 3 am if the need arose. 
     25    Counsel for the appellants at trial submitted that once the alarm sounded, his clients were under a duty to respond to the situation. Her Honour accepted this to be so, however she also found that they were duty-bound to obey their instructions, which were to avoid confrontation. It was held that the appellants were not under a duty to pursue or try to arrest the offenders, and that there was no departure from the operational plan which required the appellants to engage the offenders. Her Honour further held that there can be no duty to warn of the dangers of a course of action where the appellants were expressly told not to embark upon such a course. 26    At trial, there was also an allegation of negligence in respect of the non-supply of protective vests and shotguns. This rested upon the allegation that the respondent departed from the operational plan. Her Honour held that there was no departure from the plan by the respondent. There had been a change in the philosophy of the police service with respect to entitlement to carry specialised weapons (high powered) which had occurred with the establishment of the SPG. It was never part of the plan that the appellants carry shotguns as a part of the operation. In any event, it was found that the presence of shotguns would have made no difference in the outcome of the confrontation with the offenders. In both cases the offenders fired first. The plan did not call for the appellants to be supplied with protective vests. They were, however, available through the Armed Hold-Up Squad, yet the appellants did not take advantage of this. Finally, vests would have made no difference to the outcome, as McDonald was shot in the arm. No appeal was brought against these findings.27    At first instance, the appellants also claimed that the respondent should have evacuated the appellants from the listening post. Hazzard had considered such a possibility but discounted it in order to avoid any action commencing while Juliana’s nightclub was still in operation. No evidence was presented as to how a successful evacuation and replacement of the appellants could have been carried out without alerting the offenders and thereby endangering members of the public. 28    Her Honour also said that she accepted the reports by Shepherd and Wilson written in August 1991. However, she found their oral testimony to be contradictory in parts and attempts by them to explain their revised version of the events unsatisfactory. Her Honour held that the appellants had failed to discharge their onus with respect to the allegations of negligence or of any breach of duty by the respondent.  
      
      Submissions on Appeal 
     29    The case at trial was that the SPG should have arrived as soon as possible after the notification at 1.05 am by the appellants that the offenders were in the ceiling. The appellants’ submissions on appeal came down to, in effect, two grounds of appeal.30    The first submission on behalf of the appellants was that ‘on any view of the evidence it was part of the plan that at least two State Protection Group Officers would come to the listening post and protect the [appellants]… and… evacuate or replace them’. The appellants’ submission focuses upon what they regard as being necessary for their protection. It was contended that the provision of two or three SPG officers who, being out of uniform, would ‘surreptitiously and covertly’ enter the listening post and either remain there to protect the appellants, or allow for their evacuation, was reasonable and necessary. These SPG officers would then remain in the listening post, where they would be able to respond to any adverse contingency, including the collapse of the false ceiling whilst the offenders were in it, which was submitted as being foreseeable. It was contended that either the evacuation or protection of the appellants was both ‘feasible and reasonable’, as the listening post was located in a hotel where the movement of people in and out of doors and in the nearby lobby occurs at various times without raising any suspicion. 31    The second submission of the appellants, being one on which they failed at trial, was that the containment and arrest of the offenders should have been commenced by the SPG as soon as possible after 1.05 am. It was put to the Court that although the role of the SPG was containment and arrest of the offenders, this allocation of responsibility was no longer pertinent in the absence of the SPG. There was no provision in the plan for the protection of the appellants from adverse contingencies which had the potential to generate conflict with the offenders. It follows that the directions given to the appellants, that they were to remain in the listening post, had no application to the foreseeable situation for which no provision was made in the planning of the operation. 32    The respondent submitted that the appellants had clear orders, which they were obliged to follow. They should not have left the listening post in any circumstance.  
     33    It was submitted that those planning the operation saw it as appropriate that the SPG be located in the Remington Centre, which was stated to be only two to three minutes away from the hotel, as opposed to being located within the hotel itself. There was a reduced number of SPG members on duty at the Remington Centre at the time the confrontation of the appellants with the offenders took place. The remainder of the group involved in the operation were at home, waiting to be called out closer to the planned time of confrontation, which was envisaged to be between 3.30 and 5.30 am.34    It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was ample evidence to support the conclusions of her Honour and where there was any conflict in the evidence, it was open to her Honour to prefer the evidence that supported her conclusion. 
      
      The pleading point 
     35    On appeal, counsel for the appellants argued that the respondent was under a duty to ‘evacuate, replace or protect’ the appellants. The particulars of negligence in the Statements of Claim filed by the appellants read that ‘heavily armed state protection group members evacuate and replace the [appellants] immediately after sounds of the armed offenders were first detected’. (emphasis added) The argument with respect to negligence on appeal therefore departs from that which was particularised at trial. 
     36    Although Mr Cowan, counsel for the respondent, did not protest at the inclusion of a duty to protect the appellants being relied on by the appellants during oral argument, he was later instructed to rely upon the point and forwarded a letter to that effect to the Court. 37    In response to the notification that the respondent sought to rely upon the pleading point, Mr Gross QC, appearing on behalf of the appellants, caused a Notice of Motion to be filed seeking leave to amend the Particulars of Negligence in each Statement of Claim, so as to substitute ‘evacuate, replace or protect’ in lieu of ‘evacuate and replace’. 38    The inclusion of the failure of the respondent to ensure the protection of the appellants, as a particular of negligence, does not prejudice the respondents. Indeed, the respondent’s submissions on this point make no mention of prejudice. A duty to protect the appellants is an extension of the duty to evacuate them. At trial, the evidence presented which was relevant to a duty to evacuate the appellants was also relevant to a duty to protect them. Indeed, on one view of the matter, there may be no need to amend the particulars of negligence in the Statements of Claim. As I have said, it is not apparent that the respondent is prejudiced by the slightly different way in which the case is now put. The evidence which was required to address the issue was called before the Court at the trial. It was covered also in submissions made to the District Court and particular (e) was treated as if it included ‘protection’. In any event, it must be kept in mind that these are but particulars of negligence. See Katsilis v Broken Hill Co Pty Ltd (1977) 18 ALR 181 at 206 – 207 referring to Mummery v Irvings Pty Ltd (1956) 96 CLR 99 at 110.39    Accordingly, although it may strictly be unnecessary, the Court should grant the amendment sought. 
      
       
      Consideration 
       
     40    As I have said, the operational plan was fundamentally deficient. It made no allowance for the obviously foreseeable possibility that the ‘action’ as the hotel might well commence prior to 3 am. It was conceivable that the offenders would decide to descend from the confined ceiling space earlier than the time which police believed they intended. It should have also been appreciated, bearing in mind the fragile nature of the false ceiling, that the offenders might fall through and that this could occur at any time after they crawled into the space, which occurred at around 1 am. 
     41    It was conceded on the evidence that Assistant Commissioner Gibson had envisaged that the SPG would provide protection for the appellants. Notwithstanding, the plan made absolutely no provision for any protection for the appellants if, for whatever reason, the offenders descended from the ceiling prior to 3 am. 
     42    Not only did this grave deficiency in the plan have potential consequences for the appellants, even if they remained in the listening room, it also potentially put at risk the lives of members of the public. Those who planned the operation could not seriously have believed that if the offenders, known to be armed and highly dangerous, descended into the hotel prior to 3 am, when up to 200 people were at the nightclub, that there was no possibility of a confrontation. It must have been expected that the appellants would, if such an event occurred (as it did), leave their post, if for no other reason than to seek to protect members of the public. This would be an almost inevitable outcome notwithstanding their firm instructions not to engage the offenders. In this regard, it is hardly ‘mystifying’ that the appellants left their post, as her Honour observed. 
     43    In any event, I would have thought that the appellants’ duty was clear, particularly if they reasonably apprehended danger to the public. That duty was to leave their post and endeavour to protect any members of the public in the vicinity of the offenders. This would have been their overriding duty notwithstanding their orders. One wonders what might have been the situation if the offenders had shot any member of the public after they fell through the false ceiling and it became known that three armed police officers were secreted in a room close by but that they remained there and did not seek to protect the public or apprehend the offenders. 
     44    The failure of the plan to provide for such a contingency, as in fact occurred, and one which was readily foreseeable, placed the appellants at great risk. It also placed the public at risk.  
     45    The nature of the duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to members of the police service was discussed in State of NSW v Seedsman [2000] NSWCA 119 (Unreported, NSWCA, 12 May 2000). The respondent had suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of being involved in a number of investigations into violence against children. There had been no adequate support system or training in place to address the stresses imposed upon individuals exposed to such experiences. 
     46    Mason P stated that: 
      
       
        
        The employment relationship is one of the settled categories where a duty of care has never been in issue. So clear is the duty that it is non-delegable. In  
        Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee  
        (1999) 74 ALJR 1 Hayne J said (at [276]) (citation omitted): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The common law imposes a duty on the employer because the employer is in a position to direct another to go in harm’s way and to do so in circumstances over which that employer can exercise control. The duty is, of course, not absolute: it is the duty “of a reasonably prudent employer and it is a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the employees to unnecessary risks of injury”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The duty “ 
        extends to taking reasonable steps in accident prevention and not waiting for accidents to happen before safeguarding the health and safety of employees” 
         ( 
        Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd  
        [2000] HCA 18 at [101] per Kirby J). [paras 162 – 163] 
        
       
     47    Spigelman CJ noted that: 
      
       
        
        The laws of negligence is concerned with human beings. It is not concerned with specific occupations. [para 60] 
        
       
     48    It is clear that the duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to police officers is in no way distinguishable from that owed by any other employer to its employees. 
     49    There was a clear breach of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellants. It was the breach of duty which caused the injury and the respondent does not contest her Honour’s finding that the conduct of the appellants (in leaving their post) did not constitute a novus actus interveniens. It was not only necessary to provide protection for the appellants, as Gibson proposed and Harding accepted, but it was feasible to do so. Two or three SPG members could have been sent to the hotel, in civilian clothes, to provide protection for the appellants in the listening post. Notwithstanding Hazzard’s concerns, I am unable to appreciate that this could not have been done and advised without alerting the offenders. 
     50    One might be pardoned for concluding that it was open on the evidence to find that the reason that the plan did not provide any SPG officers to protect the appellants prior to 3 am, was in the interests of economy. It seems somewhat strange that so few members of the SPG were available at the Remington Centre at 1.05 am when the offenders were located in the ceiling and that it would have been necessary to call the balance of the officers from their homes (and beds) so that the operation could proceed later in the morning as planned. 
     51    Notwithstanding the above conclusions as to breach of duty, it must be said that on one analysis of the Operational Orders themselves, the respondent was in breach. The Orders provided that ‘on the confirmation that the offenders have secreted themselves in the false ceiling, Operations Unit personnel and Armed Hold-Up Squad personnel will form a perimeter and contain the offenders to the seventh level’. However, when the offenders’ presence in the ceiling was confirmed to the SPG at 1.05 am, there were no SPG officers available at the hotel or determined to be sent there until at least 3.30 am. Further, it was anticipated that when this phase of the operation occurred, thirty SPG members would be needed. Such numbers would not be available until much later in the morning for reasons already mentioned. 
     52    Accordingly, it is my opinion that the appeals should be allowed. The judgments entered for the respondent should be set aside and a finding in favour of the appellants be made on the issue of liability. The matters need to be remitted to the District Court for the assessment of damages. 
      
       
      Orders 
       
     53    I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. Appeals allowed with costs. 
       
       
      2. Judgment and orders in favour of the respondent be set aside. 
       
       
      3. Judgment on the issue of liability in favour of the appellants be substituted therefor. 
       
       
      4. The respondent be ordered to pay the appellants’ costs in the Court below. 
       
       
      5. Remitted to the District Court to assess the appellants’ damages.

Criminal law — Attempted aggravated assault — Non‑disclosure
of HIV status — Accused having unprotected sexual relations with complainant
during their 18-month relationship — Five months into relationship, accused
learning he was HIV-positive but failing to disclose his HIV status to
complainant — Whether accused guilty of attempted aggravated assault — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 24(1) , 265(1) (a), 268(1) , 660 .

 

The complainant and W had an 18-month relationship
beginning in June 1991.  On November 15, 1991, W learned that he had recently
tested positive for HIV.  The complainant tested negative shortly thereafter. 
W kept the complainant in the dark about his HIV condition as well as the fact
that he had been tested.  Although W was given counselling on at least three
different occasions by two doctors and a nurse about HIV, its transmission,
safer practices and his duty to disclose his HIV status to sexual partners, he
continued to practise unprotected sex with the complainant.  It was accepted
that the complainant would never knowingly have had sex with an HIV‑positive
person.  The relationship ended in November 1992 and she tested positive for
HIV in April 1994.  W has conceded that he infected the complainant with HIV. 
Similarly, the Crown has conceded that it is quite possible that W infected the
complainant before learning of his positive status.  At trial, W was convicted
of aggravated assault and common nuisance.  The Court of Appeal upheld the
conviction for common nuisance but allowed the appeal against the conviction
for aggravated assault, substituting therefor a conviction for attempted
aggravated assault.








Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

Where, as here, the Crown alleges an offence
predicated on an aggravating consequence, it must prove the consequence beyond
a reasonable doubt.  An accused who fails to disclose his HIV-positive status
cannot be convicted of an aggravated assault endangering life in circumstances
where the complainant could already have been HIV-positive.  In such
circumstances, however, W was properly convicted of attempted aggravated
assault.

 

While W acted with a shocking level of recklessness
and selfishness, the Crown could not show that sexual activity after November
15, 1991 harmed the complainant, or even exposed her to a significant risk of
harm, because at that point she was possibly, and perhaps likely, already
HIV-positive.  W’s acquittal on the charge of aggravated assault must therefore
be affirmed.  The mens rea of the offence had been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt, but the Crown was unable to prove an essential element of the
actus reus, namely that W’s sexual conduct, after learning that he had
tested positive for HIV, risked endangering the complainant’s life.  The
medical evidence indicates that a single act of unprotected vaginal intercourse
carries a significant risk of HIV transmission.  It was therefore at least
doubtful that the complainant was free of HIV infection on November 15, 1991
when W first discovered, then decided to conceal, his HIV status.  The
complainant tested negative for HIV shortly thereafter, although the expert
evidence was that at that date she may well have been infected with HIV but not
yet had time to develop the antibodies that would disclose her condition in the
test.

 








To constitute a crime, the actus reus and the mens
rea or intent must, at some point, coincide.  Here, however, before
November 15, 1991, there was an endangerment but no intent; after November 15,
1991, there was an intent but at the very least a reasonable doubt about the
existence of any endangerment.

 

The focus of the crime of aggravated assault is on the
nature of the consequences rather than on the nature of the assault.  The same
act of sexual assault by an HIV-positive accused would undoubtedly injure or
put at risk many potential partners but if, because of a complainant’s
particular circumstances, there is a reasonable doubt that the complainant was
put in harm’s way by the assault charged, there is no aggravated assault.  In
this case, there was a reasonable doubt that the life of the complainant was
capable of being endangered after November 15, 1991 by re-exposure to a virus
that she had likely already acquired.

 

There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the
complainant, believing rightly or wrongly that she was HIV-free, consented to
unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive partner.  At all relevant
times, the complainant believed that both she and W were HIV-free.

 








W stands properly convicted of attempted aggravated
assault. The crime of attempt requires the Crown to establish the mens rea
to commit the crime in question.  The intent to commit the crime of aggravated
assault is established for the period after November 15, 1991.  As to the actus
reus, failure to prove endangerment of life was fatal to the prosecution in
this case of aggravated assault but it is not fatal to a conviction for
attempted aggravated assault.  Clearly, W took more than preparatory steps.  He
did everything he could to achieve the infection of the complainant by repeated
acts of unprotected intercourse for approximately one year between November 15,
1991 and November 1992, when the relationship ended.  The reasonable doubt
about the timing of her actual infection was unknown to both partners.  These
facts, established in the evidence, are sufficient to prove the attempt.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Newfoundland and
Labrador Court of Appeal (2001), 205 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 1, 158 C.C.C. (3d)
523, [2001] N.J. No. 274 (QL), 2001 NFCA 52, upholding the accused’s conviction
for common nuisance and setting aside his conviction for aggravated assault,
but substituting a conviction for attempted aggravated assault.  Appeal
dismissed.

 

Rachel Huntsman, for
the appellant.

 

Derek J. Hogan, for the
respondent.

 

Susan Chapman and Dana
Peterson, for the intervener.

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1                                  
Binnie J. — The question
raised in this appeal is whether an accused who fails to disclose that he is
HIV-positive can be convicted of an aggravated assault endangering life by
engaging in unprotected sex with a complainant who, at the time of the alleged
assault, could herself have been infected with HIV.

 

2                                  
The respondent acted with a shocking level of recklessness and
selfishness.  There is no doubt that he committed a criminal assault on the
complainant, and further that he was guilty of an attempted aggravated
assault (as well as common nuisance).  However, as was noted by the majority in
the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, aggravated assault, as
defined in s. 268(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , is
an offence based on proof of certain consequences.  The courts below found, and
the Crown admits, that there exists a reasonable doubt that the assault in
question was capable of causing the life-threatening consequences
alleged in the indictment.  The Crown is therefore unable to establish the actus
reus of that particular offence.  Its appeal in that respect should
therefore be dismissed.

 








I.       Facts

 

3                                  
During their sexual affair that lasted for approximately 18 months,
which began when the complainant was 18 years old, the complainant and the
respondent engaged in numerous acts of vaginal intercourse and occasional
fellatio.  Condoms were used on occasion; however, the complainant did not take
the usual precautions against pregnancy because the respondent had told her
that he had had a vasectomy.

 

4                                  
The relationship began in June 1991.  The Agreed Statement of Facts says
that “soon after”, the sexual activity began.  Unfortunately, there is no
evidence about precisely when the first act of intercourse occurred, or the
approximate frequency of sexual intercourse over the ensuing 18-month period.

 

5                                  
Unknown to the complainant, the respondent attended a medical clinic in
St. John’s for HIV testing on October 16, 1991.  It seems his name was on a
list of former partners provided by an individual who had tested HIV-positive,
that is to say, was shown to be infected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. 
He was told on November 15, 1991 that he too had tested HIV-positive.  He was
given counselling on at least three different occasions by two doctors and a
nurse about HIV, its transmission, safer practices and his duty to disclose his
HIV status to sexual partners.  The respondent says he was devastated by the
result of the test, but chose to follow none of the recommended safer practices
in his relationship with the complainant, whom he kept in the dark about his
HIV condition.  He provided the names of two past sexual partners to the public
health authorities, but not the name of the complainant.  In fact, as stated,
the complainant did not know the respondent had been tested.

 








6                                  
The complainant took an HIV test on November 20, 1991.  We do not know
who or what prompted this action.  She tested negative for the virus and so
informed the respondent.  Their sexual relationship continued for another year,
terminating for unrelated reasons in November 1992.

 

7                                  
In the spring of 1994, the complainant attended a program called Skills
for Success.  A guest speaker spoke on the subject of HIV and AIDS.  The
complainant became concerned because she was displaying some of the symptoms of
HIV infection that were mentioned by the guest lecturer.  This prompted her to
get a second test done.  She was informed that she was HIV-positive on April
15, 1994.

 

8                                  
When the complainant confronted the respondent with the result of her
test, he repeatedly and falsely denied that he had ever tested positive for
HIV.

 

9                                  
When questioned as to whether she would have had sexual relations with
the respondent had she known that he was HIV-positive, the complainant’s
response as recorded in the Agreed Statement of Facts was:  “At any point in my
life, no, I would not have had sex with somebody that’s HIV-positive.”

 

10                              
In the Agreed Statement of Facts, the respondent concedes that he “did
infect [the complainant] with HIV”.  As to timing, the Crown conceded that “it
is possible that [the respondent] infected [the complainant] before
learning of his positive status” (emphasis added).

 

A.     The Medical Evidence

 








11                              
The Agreed Statement of Facts sets out, inter alia, the following
attributes of HIV infection:

 

37.  A single act of unprotected vaginal
intercourse carries a significant risk of HIV transmission.

 

38.  To date, there is no cure for HIV infection. 
The current approach to treatment is to use a combination of drugs to try and
control the virus.  Even with treatment, HIV infection can still lead to
devastating illnesses with fatal consequences.  

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

40.  Anti-body testing is still the primary way of
testing for HIV. . . .

 

41.   . . . between seventy to ninety percent of
people develop the HIV antibodies within three months of infection. 
Ninety-nine point nine percent of people will test positive for the HIV
antibodies within six months of infection.  There have been some reports where
it has taken up to a year and even one report that [it took] eighteen months.

 

12                              
Accordingly, at the time the respondent found out that he was
HIV-positive, it is clear that he had already been a carrier of HIV for a
significant period of time.

 

13                              
Equally, although the complainant tested negative for HIV shortly
thereafter, she may well have been infected with HIV but not yet had time to
develop the antibodies that would disclose her condition in the test.

 

14                              
It was therefore at least doubtful that the complainant was free of HIV
infection at the time the respondent first discovered, and then concealed, his
HIV status on November 15, 1991.

 

B.      Dr. Michael Bowmer’s Evidence

 








15                              
Dr. Bowmer, a physician with the Health Care Corporation, Infectious
Diseases and Internal Medicine, in St. John’s, was one of the specialist
doctors who counselled the respondent.  In the course of his testimony at the
preliminary inquiry, Dr. Bowmer was asked whether one partner with HIV could
re-infect another partner who was already infected with HIV.  He responded that
HIV “mutates very quickly” over a period of time and can produce in one partner
a drug-resistant strain.  The mutant strain might then be transferred to the
other partner, thereby transmitting a drug-resistant strain of HIV to which an
HIV-positive complainant had not previously been exposed, with possibly lethal
consequences.  Safer sex therefore continues to be important “because the
resistance of one virus in one person may occur at a different rate than the
resistance in another.  And then the potential is that the person who is not
resistant [to drug therapy] receives the resistant strain.” 

 

16                              
Dr. Bowmer was not called as a witness at trial, but a transcript of his
evidence at the preliminary inquiry was “adopted as a part of the facts of the
case”.  The Crown did not pursue a “re-infection” theory either at trial or on
the appeal to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal.  The Crown did not
put forward the possibility suggested by Dr. Bowmer that a partner who was
already infected with HIV could nevertheless be re-infected with a “mutant” HIV
strain resistant to drugs, possibly because Dr. Bowmer himself conceded that
“we don’t know enough about the virus in an individual person to know how
rapidly one virus is mutating to a resistant strain”.  No tests were done in
this respect on either the respondent or the complainant.

 

C.     The Court Proceedings

 








17                              
The respondent was charged with aggravated assault, criminal negligence
causing bodily harm and common nuisance.  The trial judge found the respondent
guilty of aggravated assault and common nuisance but not guilty of criminal
negligence causing bodily harm ((2000), 189 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 156).  On
appeal, the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the respondent’s appeal on
his conviction for common nuisance ((2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 523, 2001 NFCA
52).  A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against conviction
for aggravated assault, but substituted a conviction for attempted
aggravated assault.  

 

18                              
Wells C.J.N. would have dismissed the appeal against conviction on the
charge of aggravated assault because in his view, the Crown should not be required
to “do the impossible” and prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
complainant was not infected with HIV prior to November 15, 1991.  In the
present state of medical science, this can never be proven.  Recognition of
that uncertainty does not automatically constitute reasonable doubt as to
whether the respondent, on the basis of the standard set out in R. v.
Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, endangered the life of the
complainant.  In the view of Wells C.J.N., the Crown had only to prove the
chance or possibility that the complainant was still HIV-free on November 15,
1991 for there to be a risk.  While it can never be known whether the risk in
this case was low or medium or high, in his view the key is that there was a
risk.  The Court, in Cuerrier, supra, specifically decided that
proof of actual harm was not required.  It was sufficient to prove exposure to
risk.

 

II.      Analysis

 

19                              
The exposure of an unwitting sexual partner to the risk of HIV
infection, through a deliberate deception, is the stuff of nightmares, yet
cases of such misconduct now regularly come before the courts.  

 








20                              
There is no doubt that the respondent’s conduct was criminal.  He stands
convicted of attempted aggravated assault (maximum penalty of seven years) and
common nuisance (maximum penalty of two years).

 

21                              
The Crown is not satisfied with the conviction on attempted
aggravated assault.  The Crown’s view is that the respondent should be
convicted on the greater offence of aggravated assault itself.

 

22                              
The mens rea for aggravated assault is the mens rea for
assault (intent to apply force intentionally or recklessly or being wilfully
blind to the fact that the victim does not consent) plus objective foresight of
the risk of bodily harm:  R. v. Godin, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 484, at p. 485,
and Cuerrier, supra, at para. 95.  There is no dispute that,
in this case, this mental element of aggravated assault has been proven beyond
a reasonable doubt.

 

23                              
The central issue in this case, therefore, is whether, having charged
the respondent with aggravated assault, the Crown was able to prove all
of the requisite elements of the actus reus of that particular crime,
which is defined in s. 268(1)  of the Criminal Code  as follows:

 

268. (1) Every one commits an aggravated
assault who wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of the complainant.

 








24                              
Prosecution of that particular offence, which has as its focus the consequences
of the assault, is complicated in this case by the “window” of uncertain
duration between an individual contracting HIV and the ability of the medical
authorities (at least in 1991) to test for it.  The respondent seeks to exploit
this window of uncertainty in two respects.  Firstly, he says the complainant
consented at all times during their relationship to unprotected sexual
intercourse.  Based on his interpretation of Cuerrier, supra, he
says that her consent to unprotected sex after November 15, 1991 was not
vitiated by his deception.  Therefore, he argues, not only was there no
aggravated assault, there was no assault at all.

 

25                              
Secondly, he says the Crown is unable to prove an essential element of
the offence of aggravated assault, namely that the respondent’s sexual conduct
after knowing he had tested HIV-positive endangered the complainant’s life. 
The Crown, he says, is unable to prove the actus reus of one of the
particular offences it chose to prosecute.

 

26                              
I think the respondent’s first point is based on an erroneous
interpretation of Cuerrier, but that he is entitled to succeed, based on
the Agreed Statement of Facts, on his second point.

 

A.     The Critical Date – November 15, 1991

 








27                              
The most important date in this case is November 15, 1991.  On that
date, the respondent learned that he was HIV-positive.  I do not overlook the
possibility that prior to November 15, 1991 he might have anticipated at least
the risk of an HIV-positive outcome, perhaps by October 16, 1991 when he was
called in for the test, but we have no satisfactory proof of that.  The
critical date for the purpose of establishing fraud to vitiate consent (Criminal
Code , s. 265(3) (c)) is when the respondent had sufficient awareness
of his HIV-positive status that he can be said to have acted “intentionally or
recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with
wilful blindness toward them” (R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1299, at p. 1309).  In this context, the distinction between
recklessness and wilful blindness could be important:

 

Wilful blindness is distinct from recklessness
because, while recklessness involves knowledge of a danger or risk and
persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that the
prohibited result will occur, wilful blindness arises where a person who has
become aware of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry because
he does not wish to know the truth.  He would prefer to remain ignorant. 
[Emphasis added.] 

 

(Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584, per
McIntyre J.)

 

28                              
Once an individual becomes aware of a risk that he or she has contracted
HIV, and hence that his or her partner’s consent has become an issue, but
nevertheless persists in unprotected sex that creates a risk of further HIV
transmission without disclosure to his or her partner, recklessness is
established.

 

29                              
In the present case, however, the Agreed Statement of Facts does not
permit us to draw any firm conclusions about the state of the respondent’s
awareness of the danger, or even the risk of the danger of HIV infection
prior to November 15, beyond the bare fact that he was asked to take a test. 
We have almost no knowledge of the circumstances.  

 

30                              
Giving the respondent the benefit of the doubt, I therefore propose to
use November 15, 1991 as the date when, clearly, he knew that he was
HIV-positive and, moreover, had been warned by the doctors that sexual
intercourse with an unprotected partner could have potentially lethal
consequences for her, but nevertheless persisted.  








31                              
For purposes of this case, it makes no difference whether the critical
date is October 16 or November 15, 1991.  In the Agreed Statement of Facts, at
para. 46, the Crown acknowledged that the complainant might have become
infected with HIV as early as August 1991:

 

. . . it is possible that [the respondent] infected [the complainant]
before learning of his positive status.  [The complainant]’s negative test
result may have been within [the complainant]’s “window period” in that when
[the complainant] was tested on November 20, 1991 her body had not yet produced
the HIV antibodies which the test is designed to detect.  It is possible that
on November 20, 1991, [the complainant] was incubating the virus and her body
had not yet made the antibody, and thereby if present, it was undetectable.  It
is possible that she may have been infected in August, 1991, but not tested
HIV-positive on November 20, 1991.

 

32                              
The trial judge said the complainant’s negative test of November 20,
1991 is “the best evidence we have of her status at that time” (para. 26), but,
with respect, this statement flew in the face of all the medical evidence about
the duration of “the window” of incubation between the infection and
testability contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts.  At the very least,
there is a reasonable doubt about when she was first infected with HIV.

 

33                              
The Court of Appeal thought the evidence showed it likely that
the complainant was infected with HIV prior to November 15, 1991.  I agree.

 

34                              
Although the respondent was deceitful after November 15, 1991, the Crown
concedes that it cannot show that sexual activity after that date harmed the
complainant, or even exposed her to a significant risk of harm, because at that
point she was possibly, and perhaps likely, already infected with HIV.

 

B.      The Necessary Concurrence of Intent and
Endangerment

 








35                              
To constitute a crime “at some point the actus reus and the mens
rea or intent must coincide”:  R. v. Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at
p. 157.  See also R. v. Droste (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 52 (Ont. C.A.), at
pp. 53-54.  Here, however, before November 15, 1991, there was an endangerment
but no intent; after November 15, 1991, there was an intent but at the very
least a reasonable doubt about the existence of any endangerment.  Therein lies
the essence of the Crown’s problem in this case.

 

C.     The Consent Issue

 

36                              
The absence of consent is an essential element of any assault.  I
reproduce for convenience the relevant Criminal Code  provisions:

 

265. (1)  A person commits an assault when

 

(a)  without the consent of another person, he applies
force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent
is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(c)  fraud; or [Emphasis added.]

 

37                              
The meaning of consent in the assault context was recently considered by
the Court in R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 26-27, per
Major J.:

 

The absence of consent, however, is subjective and
determined by reference to the complainant’s subjective internal state of
mind towards the touching, at the time it occurred . . . .

 








Confusion has arisen from time to time on the meaning
of consent as an element of the actus reus of sexual assault.  Some of
this confusion has been caused by the word “consent” itself.  A number of
commentators have observed that the notion of consent connotes active behaviour
. . . .  While this may be true in the general use of the word, for the
purposes of determining the absence of consent as an element of the actus
reus, the actual state of mind of the complainant is determinative.  At
this point, the trier of fact is only concerned with the complainant’s
perspective.  The approach is purely subjective.  [Emphasis added.]

 

38                              
There is no doubt that the complainant did not subjectively consent to
unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner.  She so testified and there is no
reason to doubt her.  Following November 15, 1991, the respondent knew, but the
complainant did not, that he was HIV-positive.  Each act of unprotected sex
exposed her to the lethal virus.  There is nothing whatsoever in the evidence
to suggest that the complainant, believing rightly or wrongly that she was
HIV-free, consented to run such a risk.

 

39                              
In Cuerrier, supra, an HIV-positive accused had, as had
the respondent in this case, engaged in unprotected sex with two complainants
without disclosing his infection.  However, unlike here, the complainants in Cuerrier
did not become infected with HIV.  Cory J. held, at para. 127:

 

Without disclosure of HIV status there cannot be a
true consent.  The consent cannot simply be to have sexual intercourse.  Rather
it must be consent to have intercourse with a partner who is HIV-positive. 
True consent cannot be given if there has not been a disclosure by the accused
of his HIV-positive status.  A consent that is not based upon knowledge of the
significant relevant factors is not a valid consent.

 

In that case,
sex with the accused had put the complainants at significant risk to their
health.  This was sufficient to vitiate their consent to sexual intercourse.

 








40                              
The Cuerrier principle, reproduced above, applies here.  The
complainant never consented to have sexual intercourse with a partner who was
HIV-positive.  As of November 15, 1991, at the latest, he knew he was
HIV-positive and she did not.  The unexpected revelation to the complainant in
1994 that she might already have been infected by the respondent prior to
November 15, 1991, could have had no possible retroactive effect on her mental
state at the time of the relationship more than two years earlier.  At all relevant
times, she believed that both she and the respondent were HIV-free. 
That is enough to reject the respondent’s argument on consent.

 

D.     Proof of the Consequences of an Assault
Is an Essential Element of Aggravated Assault

 

41                              
The requirements of an aggravated assault include those of the assault
itself plus, as mentioned, certain listed consequences:

 

268. (1)  Every one commits an aggravated
assault who wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of the complainant.

 

The
prosecution must establish all of the elements of an assault plus the
aggravating circumstance.

 

42                              
In R. v. Leclerc (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 563 (Ont. C.A.),
Lacourcière J.A. wrote for the court, at pp. 567-68:

 

The case-law interpreting the sections quoted [ss.
265  and 268 ] makes it clear that the essential intent required for an assault,
as defined, remains the same for all forms of assault, including aggravated
assault.  Parliament intended that the severity of the punishment should
increase to reflect the more serious consequences of the assault. 
[Emphasis added.]

 








43                              
In Godin, supra, Cory J. stated, at p. 485, “[t]he section
pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or
disfiguring” (emphasis added) or (to complete the list) endangering life. 
“Endanger” means to “[p]ut in danger . . . put in peril . . . [i]ncur the
risk”:  New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical
Principles (1993), vol. 1, at p. 816.  As to the focus on consequences, see
generally R. v. Brodie (1995), 60 B.C.A.C. 153, at para. 4; R. v.
Dewey (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 348 (Alta. C.A.), at para. 9; and R. v.
Ross, [1998] O.J. No. 3427 (QL) (Gen. Div.), at para. 23.  See also R.
v. Vang (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 12.

 

44                              
Section 268(1) is only one of a number of Criminal Code 
provisions that “call for a more serious charge if certain consequences
follow”:  R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p. 966.  These include
criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221 ), criminal negligence causing
death (s. 220 ), dangerous operation causing bodily harm (s. 249(3) ), dangerous
operation causing death (s. 249(4) ), impaired driving causing bodily harm (s.
255(2) ), impaired driving causing death (s. 255(3) ), assault causing bodily
harm (s. 267 (b)), aggravated assault (s. 268 ), sexual assault causing
bodily harm (s. 272(1) (c)), aggravated sexual assault (s. 273(1) ),
mischief causing danger to life (s. 430(2) ) and arson causing bodily harm (s.
433 (b)).  

 

45                              
The “aggravation” in aggravated assault thus comes from the
consequences.  In DeSousa itself, the Court held, at pp. 966-67, per
Sopinka J.:

 

No principle of fundamental justice prevents Parliament from treating
crimes with certain consequences as more serious than crimes which lack those
consequences.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

The same act of assault may injure one person but not another. 
The implicit rationale of the law in this area is that it is acceptable to
distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally reprehensible acts on
the basis of the harm that is actually caused. . . .  [Emphasis added.]








46                              
The same act of sexual assault by an HIV-positive accused would
undoubtedly injure or put at risk many potential partners but if, because of a
complainant’s particular circumstances, she was not put in harm’s way by the
assault charged, there is no aggravated assault.  By way of further
illustration, the gunman who fires a shot into a sleeping figure intending to
kill him is not guilty of murder if, in fact, the intended victim had already
died of natural causes.

 

47                              
I therefore agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal of
Newfoundland and Labrador that proof of endangerment of the complainant’s life
was an essential element of the prosecution’s case for aggravated assault.

 

E.      The Contrary View of the Trial Judge

 

48                              
In the present case, the trial judge reviewed in some detail the
judgment in Cuerrier and acknowledged, at para. 12:

 

The essence of what Cory J. wrote was that having
unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive is inherently risky, that by
its nature it endangers.  The unique situation where it is not risky, where
it does not endanger, is where infection has already occurred.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

Having said
that, however, he found the respondent guilty of aggravated assault because

 

having unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive is inherently
risky . . . by its nature it endangers.  [Emphasis added.]

 








49                              
The trial judge erred, with respect, in switching the focus from the consequences
of the assault to the nature of the assault (“by its nature it endangers”). 
There are several provisions of the Criminal Code  that differentiate
charges on the basis of the nature of the assault, e.g., s. 271  (sexual
assault), but s. 268  (aggravated assault) is not one of them.  Under that
section, the court is directed by Parliament to focus on the consequences.

 

F.      The Dissenting View of Wells C.J.N.

 

50                              
Wells C.J.N., in his dissent, took a position intermediate between his
colleagues and the trial judge.  Unlike the trial judge, he agreed, at para.
109, that the gist of the charge lay in the consequences:

 

Clearly, if the evidence established, with
certainty, that the complainant was infected by the [respondent] (or anyone
else) prior to November 15, 1991, the [respondent] could not be found guilty on
the charge because, being already infected, the complainant was no longer in a
condition where she could be exposed to risk of such infection,
subsequent to the [respondent] discovering he was HIV positive.  She could not
become more infected.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

51                              
He also agreed that the evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to whether
the complainant was already infected as a result of unprotected sexual
intercourse with the respondent prior to November 15, 1991, but “[b]eyond
question”, he said, “it is possible that the complainant was not
infected at the time that the [respondent] learned he was HIV-positive” (para.
116 (emphasis in original)).

 

52                              
Thus, unlike Welsh J.A., he concluded that if there was a possibility
that the complainant was not infected on November 15, 1991, then she
should be considered at risk or endangerment.

 








53                              
With respect, this amounts to saying that a reasonable doubt about the
existence of the consequences required by s. 268(1)  enures to the benefit of
the Crown.  An accused would be entitled to an acquittal only if it were
established that the complainant was “with certainty” (Wells C.J.N.’s words)
infected with HIV on November 15, 1991.  This amounts to a reversal of the onus
of proof on a central element of the actus reus of the offence, namely
that the complainant was in fact put in harm’s way by the assault in question rather
than by antecedent sexual activities which, while lethal, were committed
without the requisite mens rea.

 

G.     The Refutation of “The Paradox”

 

54                              
Both the trial judge and the members of the Court of Appeal expressed
concern about the seeming paradox that in Cuerrier the accused, who did not
infect the complainants, was held guilty of aggravated assault whereas here,
the respondent, who did infect the complainant, was acquitted of
aggravated assault.  The paradox is resolved, however, when it is recognized
that in Cuerrier, the accused was deceitful about his HIV status from
the beginning of the sexual relationship whereas here, at the likely time of
the complainant’s HIV infection, she was freely engaging in unprotected sex
with a partner who was unaware of his own HIV condition and certainly unaware
that he was placing the complainant at risk.  As noted in DeSousa, supra,
at pp. 966-67:

 

Conduct may fortuitously result in more or less
serious consequences depending on the circumstances in which the consequences
arise.

 

55                              
If the Crown wishes to allege an offence predicated on an aggravating
consequence, the Crown must prove the consequence beyond a reasonable doubt.








 

56                              
There is no doubt that the complex pathology of HIV creates difficulties
in a prosecution for aggravated assault.  Other charges could have been laid: 
sexual assault, for example.  

 

57                              
The differing results in Cuerrier and this case simply reflect
the different factual circumstances.  The conduct of this respondent after
November 15, 1991 is no less reprehensible.  The abuse of the complainant’s
trust, the obtaining of her consent by deceit, and the sexual activity itself
are all common to both cases.  The difference here is that, unknown to the
respondent at the time, there was a reasonable doubt on the evidence that the
life of the complainant was capable of being endangered after November
15, 1991 by re-exposure to a virus she had likely already acquired.  

 

58                              
Section 268(1) applies to a wide variety of human activity, and its
interpretation should not be skewed to accommodate the hard facts of this
case.  Its focus should continue to be, as in the past, on the nature of the
consequences rather than on the nature of the assault.

 

59                              
I would therefore affirm the acquittal of the respondent on the charge
of aggravated assault.

 

H.     The Conviction for Attempted
Aggravated Assault

 

60                              
The Crown was able to prove every element of the offence of aggravated
assault except for one element of the actus reus:  the endangerment of
life.

 

61                              
The following provisions of the Criminal Code  are relevant:








 

24. (1)  Every one who, having an intent to
commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out
the intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not
it was possible under the circumstances to commit the offence.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

265. (1)  A person commits an assault when

 

(a)  without the consent of another person, he applies force
intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

660.  Where the complete commission of an
offence charged is not proved but the evidence establishes an attempt to commit
the offence, the accused may be convicted of the attempt.

 

62                              
The crime of attempt, as with any offence, requires the Crown to
establish that the accused intended to commit the crime in question:  R.
v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, at pp. 247-48.  The requisite intent is
established here for the period after November 15, 1991.  The respondent,
knowing at that time that he was HIV-positive, engaged in unprotected sex with
the complainant intending her thereby to be exposed to the lethal consequences
of HIV.  The evidence showed that he had been fully counselled by two doctors
and a nurse on all relevant aspects of the potential result of unprotected sex.

 

63                              
With regard to the actus reus, the Crown established beyond a
reasonable doubt every element of a sexual assault.  There was (i) physical
contact inflicted by the respondent on the complainant (ii) of a sexual nature
(iii) without valid consent:  Ewanchuk, supra, at para. 25.  In
this case, the Crown alleged “simple” aggravated assault (s. 268(1) ) rather
than aggravated sexual assault (s. 273(1) ).  While the former is
included in the latter, the maximum penalty on a conviction for attempted
aggravated sexual assault is 14 years (s. 463 (a)), i.e., the same
as for a conviction of aggravated assault simpliciter.

 








64                              
Failure to prove endangerment of life was fatal to the prosecution in
this case of aggravated assault but it is not fatal to a conviction for attempted
aggravated assault.  Clearly, the respondent took more than preparatory steps. 
He did everything he could to achieve the infection of the complainant by
repeated acts of intercourse for approximately one year between November 15,
1991 and November 1992 when the relationship ended.  The reasonable doubt about
the timing of her actual infection was the product of circumstances quite
extraneous to the respondent’s post-November 15, 1991 conduct.

 

65                              
These facts, established in the evidence, are sufficient to prove the
attempt.  As the Court explained in the United States of America v. Dynar,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at paras. 73-74, per Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:

 

An accused is guilty of an attempt if he intends to commit a crime and
takes legally sufficient steps towards its commission.  Because an attempt is
in its very nature an incomplete substantive offence, it will always be the
case that the actus reus of the completed offence will be deficient, and
sometimes this will be because an attendant circumstance is lacking. . . .

 

. . . The law of attempt is engaged only when, as in this case, the mens
rea of the completed offence is present entirely and the actus reus
of it is present in an incomplete but more-than-merely-preparatory way.

 

66                              
Here the actus reus of aggravated assault “is present in an
incomplete but more-than-merely-preparatory way” (Dynar, supra,
at para. 74).  The respondent therefore stands properly convicted of attempted
aggravated assault.

 

I.       The Medical Evidence in Future Cases

 








67                              
This case was argued on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts
supplemented by the transcript of Dr. Bowmer, who raised but was not really
asked to explore the potential medical consequences of unprotected sex between
HIV-infected partners.

 

68                              
The Court of Appeal acknowledged the possibility of proof that
“regardless of the infection, there was a significant risk to the complainant’s
life” (para. 45).

 

This could be accomplished by, for example, evidence
that the risk is increased by multiple exposures to the virus.  In the absence
of evidence to the contrary, the reasonable inference would be that, once an
individual was infected with the virus, further exposure would not increase the
risk to life.  [para. 46]

 

69                              
On the facts of this case, however, Welsh J.A. concluded, at
para. 36, that:

 

There is no evidence to establish that unprotected intercourse at that
stage could expose her to a significant risk of serious bodily harm.

 

70                              
Nothing in these reasons is intended to foreclose the possibility that
in a future case the hypothesis raised by Dr. Bowmer could be properly explored
in the evidence, and, depending on the findings of fact, lead to a different
outcome with respect to a finding of endangerment.

 

III.    Conclusion

 

71                              
I would therefore affirm the respondent’s convictions for attempted
aggravated assault and common nuisance.  I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal
with respect to the charge of aggravated assault.

 

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Entrapment—Police
informer—Possession of cocaine and heroin—Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C., 1970,
c. N-1, ss. 3(1), (2), 4(2), (3).

Appellant was found by Metropolitan Toronto
police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested. He told the police that
he worked as an informer for the R.C.M.P. but that the R.C.M.P. were unaware
that he had bought the heroin and was going to sell it. He was also found to be
in possession of cocaine. Appellant was a drug addict and this was known to the
R.C.M.P. He had been used by the R.C.M.P. as a decoy and informer, and this
involved him, according to his evidence, in purchasing drugs with money
supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs. The R.C.M.P. contact’s evidence
was that appellant had not told him that he was selling drugs as well as buying
them and that appellant was used by the R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after
his arrest, not an unusual practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.
Appellant was convicted of possession and possession for the purpose of
trafficking after his defence of entrapment was withdrawn from the jury by the
trial judge.

The Court of Appeal in affirming the convictions
but reducing the sentence asserted that the defence of entrapment was not open
to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and that U.S. judgments dealing with entrapment have not been applied in Canada. The Supreme Court granted leave to
appeal further on the question of law: “Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the learned trial judge was right in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?”

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The sole point raised by counsel for the
appelant was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police-concocted plan to

[Page 488]

ensnare him going beyond mere solicitation.
The evidence was not open to such a view. Without expressing an opinion on any
other question the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The use of spies and informers is an
inevitable requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging
their commission. Such practices do not involve such dirty tricks as to be
offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor can objection on this
ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the opportunity to others intent
upon the commission of a consensual offence. In such cases the offender can
claim no extenuation that would mitigate his culpability or the use of evidence
to establish it or his punishment upon conviction. The problem which has caused
judicial concern is the one which arises from the police instigated crime,
where the police have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have
actively organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to
prosecute the person so caught. It is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person thus drawn into the commission of an offence. In England and in New
 Zealand, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an
accused has been manifested not through recognition of it as a defence but
rather through a discretionary control of the admissibility of evidence and
through mitigation of sentence. While in Canada there is no appellate Court
judgment in which entrapment has been accepted as providing a defence or even
as going to discretionary power to exclude evidence, it was touched on in R.
v. Ormerod, [1969] 2 O.R. 230. No conclusion was reached in that
case because the issue did not arise on the facts which did not go beyond
ordinary solicitation of a suspected drug seller. The present case like Ormerod
and others does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide
what legal effect should be given to such entrapment.

The evidence in the present case taking it most
favourably to the appellant failed to show entrapment in respect of the
offences charged. Appellant had initiated a transaction which he carried out on
his own for his own benefit. The view of the Court of Appeal in this case or of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Chernecki (1971), 16
C.R.N.S. 230, rejecting entrapment as a defence should not be endorsed. That
question should be left open.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by the appellant from his conviction on charges under the Narcotics
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, ss. 3, 4. Appeal dismissed.

Victor S. Paisley, for the appellant.

S.M. Froomkin, Q.C., and Michael Dambrot,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal is here by leave
of this Court on the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in holding
that the learned trial judge was right in law in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?

The appellant was convicted after a jury trial
of two drug offences, namely, possession of cocaine contrary to s. 3(1), (2) of
the Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1 and possession of heroin
for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2), (3) of the same Act. His
main defence was entrapment, which was withdrawn from the jury in the trial
judge’s charge to them. In affirming the convictions but reducing the sentence,
the Ontario Court of Appeal asserted that the defence of entrapment was not
open to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and
that judgments of Courts in the United States dealing with entrapment have not
been applied or followed in Canada: see R. v. Kirzner[2].

The trial judge’s charge to the jury shows that
he took a broad view of entrapment, taking it to embrace the use of an agent
provocateur or the use of an informer as well as inveiglement by the
police. However, he distinguished the situation where there was a complete
concoction, presumably by the police, so that there was no actus reus and
perhaps not even any mens rea by the accused. The trial judge obviously
had in mind the judg-

[Page 490]

ment of this Court in Lemieux v. The Queen[3], to which I will return later in these reasons.

The following three passages in the charge to
the jury show how the issue of entrapment was dealt with by the trial judge:

(1)… Entrapment is basically where a police
officer or somebody in authority has inveigled somebody or tricked them to
carry out some duty, or possibly it may be argued that the person who claims
they are entrapped, did it on their own volition. In other words, it arises in
a case such as this where we have an agent provocateur, the police agent or
undercover agent who uses an informer. Now, entrapment in our law is no
defence.

(2)… If you found the accused in fact
committed the offence with which he is charged and had done this at the
solicitation of an agent provocateur, that is an undercover agent, that would
have been irrelevant as to the question of guilt or innocence It may go to the
question of sentence but if you find he has acted as an agent in an illegal act
he would still be guilty.

(3)… it is not a defence for a person who
carries out a forbidden act or consents to do it knowing what he is in fact
doing. The only thing is that it would go to the mitigation of sentence. So
that a crime in some instances may be committed from the best of motives, but
it is still a crime.

…

So, I repeat to you, basically in this country
entrapment is not defence to the charge unless the only way that you could find
would be on the evidence that the accused really had no intention of committing
the crime, it wasn’t his act, this was a complete concoction. That wouldn’t
even involve entrapment in such a case, it would really be that a crime had not
been committed. It would be something similar to what I have told you of the
undercover arrangement for the break-in.

Again I must remind you that an accused if
he in fact did commit the offence with which he was charged, and in the
circumstances he had committed the act at the solicitation of an agent
provocateur, this would go to the question of his guilt or innocence.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant
that this Court should recognize the defence of

[Page 491]

entrapment both where a drug offence has been
committed through the mere solicitation of a police agent and where the police,
through a plan or design to ensnare a person in order to prosecute him, have
induced him to commit an offence. On the other hand, counsel for the Crown has
urged this Court to refuse to recognize the defence in either situation but
contended that even if it be proper to accept entrapment as a defence, the
distinction recognized in the American cases, between mere solicitation or use
of an informer and origination of a criminal design by the police into which
the accused is drawn, would exclude it as a defence in the present case. This
submission by the Crown depends, of course, on a particular view of the evidence
as not being capable of supporting a finding that there was here a plan or
design by the police to inveigle the accused into the commission of an offence.

Entrapment is not self-defining, and, in a
generic sense, may encompass a wide array of practices involving police action
which, directly or indirectly, reveals or brings about the commission of an
offence by another. The police, or the agent provocateur or the informer
or the decoy used by the police do not have immunity if their conduct in the
encouragement of a commission of a crime by another is itself criminal. Of
course, whether they are prosecuted is a matter for the Crown attorneys and
ultimately, for the Attorneys-General. What, however, of the person who is
charged as a result of the action of an informer or who commits an offence
through the solicitation or encouragement of a spy or decoy or through police
instigation or through a plan or design of the police to ensnare him? Absent
duress, as dealt with in s. 17 of the Criminal Code, what should the
Court’s attitude be if the evidence shows police involvement, in any one of the
ways above-mentioned, in the commission of the offence?

The role of the police and the role of the
Courts in the enforcement of the criminal law are distinct although interacting.
The former are charged with the investigation and detection of criminal conduct
and with gathering the evidence upon which

[Page 492]

charges are laid to bring the alleged offenders
before the Courts for judicial determination of their culpability. Courts are
concerned with the proper interpretation and application of the criminal law
invoked against accused persons, with the propriety of the conduct of the
prosecution and of the defence, especially in the light of the fundamental
principle of the presumption of innocence, and in this connection, with the
behaviour of the police authorities in respect of their dealings with an
arrested or about-to-be arrested accused. It was in the exercise of this
judicial oversight that the Courts recognized duress as a defence (see R. v.
Steane[4]), developed
the exclusionary rules respecting confessions (see, for example, Boudreau v.
The King[5] and Piché
v. The Queen[6]) and,
in this country, have accepted res judicata or issue estoppel as a bar
to a second conviction (see Kienapple v. The Queen[7]). These were common law developments,
although, in the case of duress, codification in s. 17 of the Criminal Code has
overlaid the common law: see Paquette v. The Queen[8].

There is, of course, a balance to be struck
between giving reasonable latitude to the police in the employment of
stratagems to control the spread of crime, especially in the case of the
illegal drug traffic, and controlling behaviour that goes beyond any reasonable
latitude. American jurisdictions have, on a constitutional basis, sought to
control the introduction of illegally obtained evidence; in England, the Courts have continued to
exercise a discretionary power to control the admissibility of evidence that
would operate unfairly against an accused. Control techniques may thus relate
to the recognition of substantive defences or to rules against the admission of
evidence or to a discretion as to its reception. Abuse of process or stay of
proceedings have also been put forward as techniques of control.

Methods of detection of offences and of
suspected offences and offenders necessarily differ according to the class of
crime. Where, for example, violence or breaking, entering and theft are

[Page 493]

concerned, there will generally be external
evidence of an offence upon which the police can act in tracking down the
offenders; the victim or his family or the property owner, as the case may be,
may be expected to call in the police and provide some clues for the police to
pursue. When “consensual” crimes are committed, involving willing persons, as
is the case in prostitution, illegal gambling and drug offences, ordinary
methods of detection will not generally do. The participants, be they deemed
victims or not, do not usually complain or seek police aid; that is what they
wish to avoid. The police, if they are to respond to the public disapprobation
of such offences as reflected in existing law, must take some initiatives. They
may, for example, use a spy, either a policeman or another person, to obtain
information about a consensual offence by infiltration; they may make
arrangements with informers who may be parties to offences on which they report
to the police to enable the other parties to be apprehended; or the police may
use decoys or themselves act under cover to provide others with the opportunity
to commit a consensual offence or to encourage its commission. Going one step
farther, the police may use members of their force or other persons to
instigate the commission of an offence, planning and designing it ab initio to
ensnare others.

The use of spies and informers is an inevitable
requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging their
commission; otherwise, it would be necessary to await a complaint by a “victim”
or to try to apprehend offenders in flagrante delicto, an exercise not
likely to be crowned with much success. Such practices do not involve such
dirty tricks as to be offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor
can objection on this ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the
opportunity to others intent upon the commission of a consensual offence. In
all such cases, the offender can claim no extenuation that would mitigate
either his culpability or the use of evidence to establish it or his punishment
upon conviction.

[Page 494]

The problem which has caused judicial concern is
the one which arises from the police‑instigated crime, where the police
have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have actively
organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the
person so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person who has thus been drawn into the commission of an
offence.

There is no doubt that it may be difficult in
particular cases to draw the line between mere use of spies, decoys or
informers and the use of agents provocateurs who go beyond mere
solicitation or encouragement and initiate a criminal design for the purpose of
entrapping a person in order to prosecute him. The principle of the distinction
has, however, been recognized in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of the
United States which has established that entrapment, in the ensnarement sense
above-mentioned, is available as a defence. The line of cases begins with Sorrells
v. United States[9] and
extends through Sherman v. United States[10], United States v. Russell[11] and Hampton v. United States[12]. The issue in the United States, as
reflected in the foregoing judgments of its Supreme Court and in a host of
judgments of other federal Courts and of state Courts, is no longer whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence or a bar to conviction but whether
the approach to it should be subjective, fastening on the predisposition of the
particular accused, or objective, fastening on the police conduct and on
whether that conduct would have caused a reasonable person to commit the
offence. On the subjective approach, an accused with a predisposition to the
crime would not have the benefit of the defence of entrapment, regardless of
the degree of police involvement.

In England, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an accused has been
manifested not through recognition of a defence on that ground

[Page 495]

but rather through a discretionary control of
the admissibility of evidence and through mitigation of sentence: see Mealey
and Sheridan v. The Queen[13]; R.
v. Birtles[14]; R.
v. Ameer and Lucas[15]. The
Courts of New Zealand have taken the same view: see R. v. Capner[16]; R. v. Pethig[17]. In Canada there is no appellate Court judgment in which entrapment has been
accepted as providing a defence or even as going to discretionary power to
exclude evidence. Although it was touched on by me as a member of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Ormerod[18],
I was of the opinion there that I did not think it wise in that case to come to
any conclusion on the acceptability of entrapment as a defence. That was
because the issue did not arise on the facts, which did not go beyond ordinary
solicitation of a suspected drug seller.

In R. v. Chernecki[19], the British Columbia Court of Appeal
likewise found that the facts did not show such “calculated inveigling or
persistent importuning” (words used by me in R. v. Ormerod as a
description of entrapment) as to make it necessary to consider whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence. The Court added that it did not
think that any such defence existed at the time in Canada. However, in R. v. Bonnar[20],
the Nova Scotia Appeal Division stated that if entrapment (as opposed to merely
providing an opportunity for the commission of an offence) was established the
proper course was to stay proceedings or to discharge the accused where he did
not have a prior intention or predisposition to commit the offence charged.
Macdonald J.A. speaking for the Court considered that there was abuse of
process in such a situation and that the entrapment was contrary to public
policy. In the particular case, it was held on appeal that the facts did not

[Page 496]

show entrapment.

The present case, like Ormerod, Chernecki and
Bonnar does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide what
legal effect should be given to a showing of entrapment as I have described it.
The facts, taking them, as we must, most favourably to the accused, are against
such a showing, and I shall come to them shortly. In these circumstances, I
would not, however, endorse the view of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the
present case or of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Chernecki rejecting
entrapment as a defence. There are good reasons for leaving the question open.
Indeed, if that position is based on a static view of s. 7(3) of the Criminal
Code I find it unacceptable. I do not think that s. 7(3) should be regarded
as having frozen the power of the Courts to enlarge the content of the common
law by way of recognizing new defences, as they may think proper according to
circumstances that they consider may call for further control of prosecutorial
behaviour or of judicial proceedings.

Although Courts may agree that entrapment
outrages one’s sense of decency and shames the administration of justice, there
is a difference of opinion as to what the control mechanism should be. The
division of opinion in the United States between the subjective and objective
approaches to entrapment is one aspect of the problem although it appears that
there is growing disposition in lower Court decisions, especially in those of
state Courts, to opt for the objective approach as being one which avoids
problems that arise in fastening on the predisposition of particular accused.
Among the extensive literature on the subject reference may be made to
Donnelly, Judicial Control of Informants, Spies, Stool Pigeons and Agents
Provocateurs (1951) 60 Yale L.J. 1091; Park, The Entrapment Controversy (1975-76)
60 Minn. L. Rev. 163. The Model
Penal Code of the American Law Institute, promulgated in 1962, appears to have
incorporated an objective approach in its

[Page 497]

broadened definition of entrapment in s.
2.13(1), reading as follows:

(1) A public law enforcement official or a
person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if
for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he
induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such
offense by either:

(a) making knowingly false
representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not
prohibited; or

(b) employing methods of persuasion
or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be
committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.

The English Law Commission, which has given some
consideration to the problem and has examined the way in which the American Law
Institute’s Model Penal Code has dealt with the matter was undecided on whether
there should be a defence of entrapment but would circumscribe it as narrowly
as has the Model Penal Code: see English Law Commission, Working Paper No. 55
(1974). Professor Glanville Williams in his work The Criminal Law, The
General Part (2nd ed. 1961) at p. 785 says this:

Is there any technical means by which the
courts could give effect to a defence of official instigation or procurement,
if they were so minded? If one thinks merely in terms of established legal
concepts, as the English courts have hitherto done, it may seem difficult to
give an affirmative answer. The police have no general power to consent to or
authorise acts that would otherwise be breaches of the criminal law. The strict
doctrine of estoppel has not been applied in criminal law, except in respect of
estoppel by judgment; and in any event the situation is not precisely one of
estoppel. In civil law the doctrine of estoppel is not allowed to be used to
extend the limits of governmental power. There is no other ready-made doctrine
to cover the situation.

Another English writer, J.D. Heydon, The
Problems of Entrapment, [1973] Camb. L.J. 268 would reject entrapment as a
defence but would give it legal effect through a discretionary bar on the
admission of evidence and as a mitigating factor in sentencing.

[Page 498]

Another issue concerns the range or class of
offences on which entrapment should have a bearing, either as a matter of
defence or of discretionary control of admissibility of evidence or of the
course of proceedings: see Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections,
Towards Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections, 1969 (The Ouimet Report), at
pp. 79-80. The American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code has taken the position
that with respect to some offences, as for example offences of violence, the
social interest in controlling the behaviour of an accused outweighs that
involved in disapprobation of undesirable police behaviour: see s. 2.13(3).

There is the further problem arising in jury
trials whether entrapment should be dealt with by judges alone, or should
involve the jury as a trier of fact. The Model Penal Code takes the position
that the issue of entrapment should be tried by the Court in the absence of the
jury: s. 2.13(2). The jury would not be excluded on the subjective test
since, if there was evidence of entrapment, it would be for the jury to
determine if there was entrapment in fact and if there was predisposition in
the accused. This is consistent with Canadian practice in respect of factual
issues in a trial with a jury, which is to limit the judge to a determination
of whether there is evidence to go to the jury and to leave it to the jury to
act on its view of the evidence once the issue is left to them.

In short, there are difficult questions that
arise in respect of entrapment which prudence dictates we should leave for
consideration when a decision thereon is demanded by the record. Canadian
writings on the subject have been alive to this policy of avoidance in their
examination of a number of cases, two of them in this Court, which raised
entrapment issues but the writings, useful survey articles, have also been
alive to the dilemmas that entrapment raises: see Shafer and Sheridan, The
Defence of Entrapment (1970), 8 Osg.H.L.J. 277; Watt, The Defence of
Entrapment (1971), 13 Cr.L.Q. 313; Sneideman, A Judicial Test for
Entrapment: The Glimmerings of a Canadian

[Page 499]

Policy on Police-Instigated Crime (1973), 16 Cr.L.Q. 81.

I wish to refer to the two cases in this Court
in which an issue of entrapment was allegedly raised by the facts. They are Lemieux
v. The Queen, supra, and Patterson v. The Queen[21]. In Lemieux v. The Queen, supra, an
informer, acting under police instruction, induced the accused to participate
in a break-in as driver of the car in which the informer and a third person
were taken to the particular house. The owner co-operated by giving the police
a key to the premises. It was found that the accused had no thought of being party
to any such offence until induced by the informer to participate. This Court,
speaking through Judson J., held that it was open to the jury to find that
there was no actus reus in view of the owner’s consent to the
breaking and entering. The facts, leaving aside the participation of the owner
of the premises selected for the break-in, fit exactly the defence of
entrapment as accepted in the American cases. In concluding his reasons, Judson
J. said this, at p. 496:

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence
with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act
at the solicitation of an agent provocateur would have been irrelevant
to the question of his guilt or innocence.

This observation was not, of course, necessary
to the decision, and in so far as it envisages the same set of facts but
without the house owner’s involvement, it would involve entrapment as I have
viewed it in these reasons. On the other hand, if there was solicitation by an
informer without the complicity of the police, there would be no question of
entrapment.

Patterson v. The Queen involved a charge of keeping a bawdy house, a charge which arose out
of a telephoned sexual proposition by a police agent, resulting in an
assignation at certain residential premises where the police disclosed their
identity and made an arrest. This Court allowed an appeal from conviction on
the ground that there

[Page 500]

was no evidence of frequent or habitual use of
the house for the purpose of prostitution and it does not appear that any
question of entrapment was argued; certainly it was not dealt with. In any
event, the mere telephone solicitation would not qualify, in respect of a
willing accused, as an entrapment within the rationale of the cases that have
recognized such a defence.

A different set of facts concerning police
instigation of an offence is found in R. v. Woods[22], a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. That Court set aside a conviction of breaking and entering and theft
(and in the result, directed an acquittal) where it appeared that off duty
police officers in plain clothes, passing themselves off as toughs from
Toronto, threatened violence to the accused, whom they had not previously met,
if he did not produce a stolen outboard motor which they wished to purchase at
a discount. The accused yielded to the threats, broke into a marina and stole
an outboard and was then charged. The fact of the threat of violence came out
in the evidence of the police officers but the magistrate who tried the accused
convicted on the basis of giving credit to the evidence of one of the officers
because the magistrate knew him personally. The Court of Appeal found this to
be an extraneous circumstance and concluded the conviction must be quashed and
then (the Crown agreeing) ordered an acquittal. No consideration was given to
entrapment as a possible defence.

There are two lower Court decisions, R. v.
Shipley[23], an
Ontario County Court judgment R. v. MacDonald[24], a judgment of a British
 Columbia Provincial Court, in which, on a finding of
entrapment, a stay of proceedings was directed in the first case and an
acquittal in the second. In another more recent British Columbia Provincial

[Page 501]

Court judgment, R. v. Haukness[25], in which the aforementioned two cases
were considered as well as Ormerod and Chernecki, an acquittal
was also entered on a direct recognition of entrapment as a defence, the Court
saying that “notwithstanding [the accused’s] commission [of the drug] offence,
it would be contrary to the principles of the administration of justice in this
country to convict him”. Having indicated that I prefer to leave open the
question whether entrapment, if established, should operate as a defence I
express no view on the approach taken in the Haukness case. Similarly, I
leave open the question whether the appropriate way to deal with entrapment is
by a stay of proceedings, a matter considered by this Court in another context
in R. v. Rourke[26]. In
the present case, although the factum of the accused mentions stay of
proceedings, his counsel did not press the point, nor did he found any of his
submissions on any issue of admissibility of evidence. His main, indeed, sole
point was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police‑concocted plan to ensnare him going beyond mere
solicitation.

I do not think that the evidence is open to such
a view. Although the trial judge’s charge is confusing on what is meant by
entrapment, the accused cannot complain of the withdrawal of entrapment as a
defence (assuming it to be a defence, if established by a preponderance of
evidence) if there was no evidence upon which it could be based.

The accused was found by the Metropolitan
Toronto police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested by them. He made
certain statements to the police, including assertions that he worked as an
undercover agent, as an informer in fact, for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. The state-

[Page 502]

ments were admitted in evidence after a voir
dire as to their admissibility. He told the Toronto police that the R.C.M.P. were unaware that he had bought the heroin
and unaware that he was going to sell it. When taken to the police station he
was found in possession of cocaine as well as heroin. Upon his release from
custody and while awaiting trial, the accused had several conversations with
members of the Toronto police force about acting as a paid informer but nothing
came of it.

The accused was a drug addict, and this was
known to the R.C.M.P. and to a particular officer of that force, one Gascon. He
had been used by the force on various occasions as a decoy and informer to
ferret out information on drug pushing in the Montreal area, and this involved him, according to his evidence, in
purchasing drugs with money supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs as
well. He reported these activities to his R.C.M.P. contact. It was also
Kirzner’s evidence that he told Gascon of a chance encounter with a person in
the illegal drug trade through whom he could set up a big “buy” and that Gascon
agreed to the plan. Gascon was on vacation when the chance for the “buy”
arrived, but the accused went ahead on his own and consummated the deal,
although it was by no means clear that he was under instruction by Gascon to go
ahead in the latter’s absence. It was in respect of this “buy” of heroin that
the accused was arrested. Gascon’s evidence was that the accused had not told
him that he was selling drugs as well as buying them. He was used by the
R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after his arrest, but this was not an unusual
practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.

I fail to see how this evidence, taking it most
favourably to the accused, shows entrapment in respect of the offences
committed by the accused. To me it is obvious that he saw his police contacts
as a shield for activities which he carried out on his own, activities
amounting to trafficking in drugs. He had initiated a transaction which he
carried out for his own benefit.

[Page 503]

In the result, while not agreeing with the
reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal, I come to the same conclusion and would
dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—As the Chief Justice says in reasons
which I have had the advantage of reading, the sole point raised by counsel for
the accused at the hearing was that entrapment should have been left to the
jury because the evidence showed a police-concocted plan to ensnare him going
beyond mere solicitation. I agree that the evidence is not open to such a view
and that accordingly the accused cannot complain on that account although the
trial judge’s charge was confusing. Without expressing an opinion on any other
question, I concur in the disposition of the case proposed by the Chief
Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

       SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 16 November 2005 an indictment was presented against William Matheson charging him with the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken on 24 November 2003. He pleaded not guilty to this charge and a jury was duly empanelled. On 9 December 2005 the jury found him guilty as charged. The matter was then stood over for submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    2 The story behind this trial is quite an extraordinary one, involving great tragedy to a number of people.  
     
      
    3 Lyndsay Van Blanken was born on 26 August 1985. She was a little over eighteen years old when she met her death in November 2003. She was described as shy and introverted, but she was also a very kindly affectionate girl, with considerable humour and flair. She also had great artistic talent. In mid 2003 she was one of a very small number of people who were accepted as apprentice animators at Disney Toons from amongst a large number of applicants. 
     
      
       
      William Matheson, the offender, was born on 10 August 1982 and was thus three years older than Lyndsay. He was a skilled cellist, and obtained work as a musician whenever it was available. He and Lyndsay first met on 13 April 2001 when Lyndsay’s mother married her stepfather, David Pleasance. Matheson was playing the cello as part of a string quartet which performed at the wedding. A friendship developed between the two of them which gradually became closer and more intimate. On all accounts, however, it was an unusual type of relationship. They rarely, if ever, went out on normal dates. Lyndsay at that stage was living with her mother and stepfather in Carrington Road, Queens Park. The offender was living in Coogee. They used to regularly go out late at night and take long walks together, returning in the early hours of the morning.  
       
      
    4 At the same time, Lyndsay was developing a close relationship over the Internet with an American, Brandon Leonard. They both became so involved in this relationship that Brandon proposed marriage to her in June 2003. When she accepted, he posted her a ring which arrived in July. Brandon himself then arranged to come to Australia. He arrived in Sydney on 9 September, a few weeks after Lyndsay had commenced working for Disney Toons. 
     
      
    5 The impending arrival of Brandon Leonard meant that Lyndsay was forced to do something about her relationship with William Matheson. She discussed this with her sister, Louise Betts. Two days before Brandon’s arrival, she told Matheson that she did not want to see him any more. She did not tell him about Brandon Leonard. However it did not take long for Matheson to find out about Brandon. Within a very few days of the latter’s arrival, Matheson followed Lyndsay near her workplace when she and Brandon were walking arm in arm. He later discovered that they were engaged.. 
     
      
    6 It is clear that Matheson’s attitude toward Lyndsay changed dramatically when he realised that there was another man in her life. Whereas previously their relationship, although close, had been a relatively casual one, he became intense and obsessive. He told Lindsay’s sister Louise that he could not live without her. He started to follow her around and was often seen waiting outside her workplace at lunchtime or when she was due to finish work. In current parlance, he was clearly stalking her.  
     
      
    7 On Friday 21 November Lyndsay told her mother how concerned she was about Matheson. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mum I don’t know what to do about Will, he won’t leave me alone and I’m getting very frightened. I don’t know what to do about it.” 
        
       
      
    8 At about lunchtime, on Saturday 22 November Matheson went with his father to the Bondi Junction Shopping Centre where he purchased a very large cricket bag at the Rebel Sports Store. This bag assumed great significance during the trial, and I will be returning to discuss it later. 
     
      
    9 In the meantime Lyndsay’s relationship with Brandon Leonard had flourished. They were living together in an apartment directly behind the home where her mother and stepfather, Cynthia and David Pleasance lived. It was planned that the two of them, Lyndsay and Brandon would go to the United States for Christmas. Lyndsay was very excited about this. 
     
      
    10 On the morning of Monday 24 November 2003 Lyndsay went to work as usual. At lunchtime, when she left the Disney building with work friends, William Matheson was waiting outside. Lyndsay spent about ten minutes with him and then rejoined her friends. That evening she left work at the normal time, about 5.30, and took a train to Bondi Junction. She started to walk home from the station. Matheson was waiting for her outside the Cock & Bull Hotel, not far from the station. He later said that they walked together towards her home and then parted company near Queens Park, a few blocks from her home. He himself then walked across Queens Park, and went straight to his own home. That night he played the cello in a concert at the Entertainment Centre. Others who were there with him described him as acting quite normally. 
     
      
    11 Lyndsay Van Blanken was never seen alive again. When she failed to come home that night and her mobile phone did not respond to calls, the police were called in. By Wednesday 26 November the matter was being treated very seriously. That day the police conducted an electronically recorded interview with William Matheson who described his movements on the Monday and confirmed that he had last seen Lyndsay at the corner of Edmund and Victoria Streets, Queens Park, which was not far from her home. He was asked about his relationship with Lyndsay and he said that he was naturally upset when she broke it off, but that they had remained friends since then and had seen each other at least once a week. He said that Lyndsay seemed perfectly normal when he last saw her. She was very excited about her proposed trip to the United States with Brandon Leonard.  
     
      
    12 All police investigations as to the whereabouts of Lyndsay Van Blanken proved fruitless until 10 January 2004. On that day, complaints from residents of an apartment block at 52 Queens Park Road, Queens Park, that there was a very bad smell in the building, finally led to investigations being conducted. In a storeroom off a car park on the ground floor of the building a large cricket bag was discovered containing the heavily decomposed body of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Cable ties were found around her neck, indicating that the cause of death was strangulation.  
     
      
    13 When William Matheson heard of the finding of Lyndsay’s body he became extremely disturbed. On 12 January he was admitted to the “Kiloh” Unit, which is the Psychiatric Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital. He was in a state of great distress: weeping and incoherent and talking about suicide. He was diagnosed as suffering from possible schizophrenia and/or possible schizotypal personality disorder, accompanied by depression. He was placed on medication for these conditions but it took some time for his condition to stabilise.  
     
      
    14 It was not until 22 March that Matheson’s treating psychiatrist said that he was fit to be interviewed by the police. The police attention was focussing on him at that point, because of the cricket bag in which Lyndsay’s body had been found. Inquiries revealed that only one bag of its type had been sold in the whole of Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs in the previous six months. That bag was sold from the Rebel Sports Store at Bondi Junction on 22 November 2003 at precisely the same time as William Matheson was in the area, having been driven there by his father. His father had told the police that when his son returned to the car he was carrying a large sports bag.  
     
      
    15 On 22 March 2004, a further electronically recorded interview took place between Detective Sergeant Doueihi and the offender William Matheson. He repeated the account he had given earlier of his movements on 24 November, the day Lyndsay went missing. The police then asked him about the sports bag which he had with him when he rejoined his father on 22 November. Matheson said that he had found it in the street, and he described the precise location where he said he had found it. However film that was taken on a security camera outside the Cock & Bull Hotel at Bondi Junction clearly contradicted his version. This film footage assumed central importance in the trial, for it pointed convincingly to the fact that the bag which was carried by the offender when he got into his father’s car was the bag which had been purchased only a few minutes earlier at the Rebel Store, being the same bag which was later found to contain the body of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Moreover, it showed that Matheson had lied about how he had acquired this bag.  
     
      
    16 A few days later, on 26 March 2004, the police took Matheson on a “walk through” to the locations at Bondi Junction where he said he had found the sports bag and the point where he said he had parted from Lyndsay on the evening of 24 November. He said that after leaving her, he walked straight across Queens Park. Later evidence showed that this would not have been possible, as sports games were taking place on the park at the time. Very significantly, he said that he was familiar with the apartment building at 52 Queens Park Road, Queens Park as he and Lyndsay used to go there and spend some time in one of the storerooms. The room he described was different from the storeroom in which Lyndsay’s body was located.  
     
      
    17 On 31 March 2004 Matheson requested that he be re-interviewed by the police. In this interview he told them that he had experienced auditory hallucinations for a number of years. Voices ordered him to harm or kill people and also to harm himself. He denied however that any of these voices related to Lyndsay Van Blanken. Specifically he denied that the voices had ever told him to harm her. He said that he had never told anyone about these voices because he did not want people to be nervous around him. He told his parents about them for the first time on 11 January 2004, the day before his admission to the Kiloh Centre. He said he had heard these voices for about six years but had never acted on them as he did not want to hurt anybody. He would go out and walk the streets or sleep in parks rather than stay home and risk burning the house and harming his parents, as the voices were telling him to do. 
     
      
    18 Only a small part of this interview was placed before the jury at the trial. The defence had objected to evidence relating to the accused’s mental state going before the jury, and after a voir dire hearing relating to this material I ruled that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value and that it was not to be admitted.  
     
      
    19 On 19 May 2004 Matheson was arrested and charged with the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    20 The Crown case at trial was dependent upon circumstantial evidence, as Matheson had consistently denied his guilt. The purchase of the sports bag was the most powerful single piece of evidence against him, but there were other matters linking him with Lyndsay’s death. These included the fact that he was later found to be in possession of Lyndsay’s art diary, a book which her mother and sister both said she kept with her at all times. There was also evidence of unusual scratches and other markings on his body immediately after 24 November 2003. In addition there were audio tapes and writings made by Matheson. These indicated the extent of his obsession with Lyndsay Van Blanken. Some of them also appeared to reveal knowledge that Lyndsay was dead, although they were made before her body was located. The cumulative effect of all this evidence made for a strong Crown case, and it was not surprising that the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    21 I turn now to say something about William Matheson himself. Most of this comes from the psychiatric and psychological reports which were tendered on sentence. He described himself as having had a relatively happy childhood and a “wonderful” relationship with his parents. Nevertheless, there were some very disturbing events during his childhood. When he was nine, his brother, his only sibling, who was then seventeen years old, committed suicide by jumping off the top floor of the Price of Wales Hospital. It is understood that his brother was suffering from schizophrenia. Matheson’s parents also have a history of psychiatric problems. His father, a retired school teacher, was said to have a schizotypal personality disorder and his mother also suffers from a form of personality disorder. Following her older son’s death, she was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for a period of time. The household has been described as extremely disorganised. 
     
      
    22 William Matheson did his secondary schooling at the Waverley College. On all accounts it was a difficult time. He was the butt of some serious bullying and clearly felt himself to be an outsider. Although he was said to be above average intelligence, his scholastic results were generally poor to average. He remained at school for his Higher School Certificate but obtained quite a poor result. The one field in which he excelled was music. His mother was an accomplished cellist and he also was very skilled in this instrument. 
     
      
    23 After leaving school Matheson obtained a job as an apprentice doing panel van conversions but he was not interested in this work and he left it after about six months. He has had no full time work since then, but has played the cello in orchestras or groups when called on to do so.  
     
      
    24 When he was about thirteen or fourteen years old Matheson had a period when he took cannabis in quite large doses. It seems that the onset of his auditory hallucinations commenced not long after he ceased taking this drug. He has no other history of substance abuse.  
     
      
    25 Matheson has continued to take anti-psychotic and anti-depressive medication throughout his time in custody. He was placed into protection within a few days of going into custody and is likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. He has been maintaining his studies in music and Latin and has had regular visits from his parents. 
     
      
    26 Two psychiatrists gave evidence on sentence, Dr Michael Giuffrida and Dr Stephen Allnutt. Dr Giuffrida interviewed Matheson at Silverwater on 8 March 2005 and again on 3 January 2006. The doctor had been provided with the major documents in the prosecution brief, including the medical records from the Kiloh Centre relating to Matheson’s presentation between January and March 2004. The doctor provided the defence lawyers with two lengthy reports dated respectively 16 March 2005 and 13 January 2006.  
     
      
    27 Dr Giuffrida noted a marked improvement in Matheson’s mental state on the second time he spoke to him. In March 2005 Matheson had presented as cautious and vague with a remarkably poor recollection of events and times in the past and a significant paucity of understanding as to the meaning and significance of issues. In January 2006 Dr Giuffrida noted that he was relaxed, polite and co-operative and not at all guarded or cautious as he had been previously. On this occasion he was able to provide a clear and coherent account of his history. Dr Giuffrida found no evidence of thought disorder or cognitive impairment. He considered that Matheson suffered from schizophrenia. This had responded reasonably well to medication but a number of the symptoms were continuing. Dr Giuffrida assessed Matheson’s risk factor as being 22 out of 40.  
     
      
    28 Matheson has always maintained his denial of killing Lyndsay Van Blanken and he asserts that he has no memory of anything unusual happening between the two of them on the evening that she went missing. Given that he had already been convicted of Lyndsay’s murder by the time Dr Giuffrida wrote his second report, Dr Giuffrida posited in that report two psychological mechanisms which he said might account for Matheson’s amnesia about the killing. The first related to the illness of schizophrenia, and the second to the horrific nature of the events themselves, which could lead to amnesia, even in persons not suffering from psychosis.  
     
      
    29 Dr Giuffrida was called by the defence on sentence. During his evidence he was told about the evidence that the accused had bought the sports bag in which Lyndsay’s body was later placed, only two days before the killing, and had then lied about how he had acquired the bag. I asked the doctor how that form of preparation, two days earlier, could sit with the killing being the product of a psychiatric illness. Dr Giuffrida answered that that would “tend to go against the likelihood that there was a psychotic mechanism involved in the killing.” The doctor did not resile from his opinion that Matheson was suffering from schizophrenia at the time (or, at the very least, a schizotypal personality disorder), but said that this degree of planning was inconsistent with him being severely psychotic, as a severely psychotic person’s capacity to organise and plan is impaired. Matheson’s schizophrenia might have impaired his judgment and affected his decision making processes, but it could not be put higher than that. 
     
      
    30 Dr Stephen Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, did not believe that Matheson’s psychiatric condition was as serious as diagnosed by Dr Giuffrida or that it played any causative role in the killing of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Dr Allnutt saw Matheson on three occasions in February and March 2006 and provided the Crown with a lengthy report dated 9 March 2006. In his report, and again in his evidence, Dr Allnutt expressed scepticism about the diagnosis of schizophrenia in Matheson’s case. He preferred a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. I do not propose to explore this difference in diagnosis in any detail. As Dr Allnutt pointed out, it is a difference of degree only, namely the point on the spectrum of mental health where the offender lies. There is no doubt that Matheson lies towards the disturbed end of the spectrum. Precisely where he lies on that end is, in my view, of not great significance in the circumstances of this case. This is because, as Dr Giuffrida conceded, the offender’s illness, if it was that, did not have a significant causative effect upon this killing. The most that can be said is that it might have led to some impairment of judgment, a matter which Dr Allnutt strongly disputed. 
     
      
    31 As Dr Allnutt pointed out, the ERISP between the police and Matheson on 26 November 2003 provided significant insight into Matheson’s mental condition less than two days after the killing. Dr Allnutt said that he saw in that interview little or no evidence that would lead him to believe that Matheson was suffering from a major mental illness. Matheson dealt with questions as to what might have happened to Lyndsay in a manner that Dr Allnutt said showed “quite excellent judgment” given that it was Matheson himself who had killed her, and he therefore had to be dissembling in his answers. Dr Allnutt pointed out that later on the night of the killing Matheson went home, got changed and went to the Entertainment Centre where he played the cello in a public performance. The doctor could find no evidence to support the conclusion that he was suffering from an impairment of judgment at that time. 
     
      
    32 In my view Dr Allnutt’s analysis is very compelling. In the end, I find that whatever psychiatric condition the offender was suffering from at the time had little causative effect upon this killing. It might have and probably did produce some impairment of judgment, but its ameliorating effects were of a minor order only. 
     
      
    33 Where does all this lead to in the sentencing process? The sentencing legislation requires that the court first set a non-parole period and then the balance of the sentence which, in the absence of special circumstances, is not to exceed one third of the non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for the crime of murder is twenty years. This is applicable to offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the crime in question. The objective circumstances of this case must, in my view, put it in the more serious range. Lyndsay’s killing was clearly premeditated and planned. Both the buying of the sports bag and the preparation of the cable ties with which she was strangled, bear testament to this. It is therefore difficult to see it as a “crime of passion”, as urged by the defence. The killing itself was brutal and cruel to the extreme. The cable ties used to strangle Lyndsay were such that, once in place, they could only be tightened. It was impossible to loosen or release them. We will never know the ruse by which Matheson lured Lyndsay to the place where she met her death. Once there, when she realised what was going to happen, one can only start to imagine the horror she must have suffered. It is a horror which haunts her mother and her sister to this day, as attested in their very moving victim impact statements.  
     
      
    34 I should say that I have taken those statements into account, but in accordance with the legislation I have not used them in determining the sentence in this matter. 
     
      
    35 All these matters lead me to conclude that the objective circumstances of this killing brings it above the mid-range of seriousness, even for the crime of murder. This is, however by no means the end of the matter. I am also obliged to take into account aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A of the relevant legislation and under the common law. The aggravating features under s 21A which are relevant to this case (and which are not inherent in the charge of murder) are, under paragraph (c), that it involved the use of a weapon, and under paragraph (n) that it was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    36 There are no mitigating features whatsoever in relation to this offence. However there are a number in relation to the offender himself. He is still a very young man, only twenty-three years old. He was a person of prior good character with no record of previous convictions. Whilst his mental disorder may have had little causal relationship with this killing, it is still a highly relevant matter in relation to other aspects of the sentencing process, particularly relating to risk factors and to his need for continuing treatment and supervision. In this regard it is worth noting that Matheson’s presentation has visibly changed since his first ERISP in November 2003. In later ERISPS his affect has been much flatter, and he has put on a great deal of weight. I can only assume that this is the product of the medication he has been taking. 
     
      
    37 Imprisonment is particularly harsh for this offender. Since very shortly after going into custody he has been kept in protection, and he is likely to remain there for most of, if not all, of his sentence. His present regime allows him only about two hours each day outside his cell. 
     
      
    38 Assessing the offender’s risk factor is a very difficult exercise given that we know so little about what motivated him to carry out this brutal and apparently senseless killing. Dr Giuffrida assessed it in the middle range, and in the absence of any contrary evidence I think I should accept this as generally correct. There is no doubt that Matheson will need to continue his medication, probably for the rest of his life. This, if nothing else, provides “special circumstances” which entitle me to vary the normal proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence, so that his medication regime can be supervised for a significant period after his return to the community. 
     
      
    39 The objective seriousness of this killing is, as I have already said, above the mid-range of seriousness even for an offence of murder. On the other hand, the mitigating features relating to the offender personally, as opposed to the offence, require a significant reduction in what would otherwise be the appropriate non-parole period. Balancing all these features I consider that a non-parole period of eighteen years, should be applied in his case. The head sentence is to be twenty-seven years. 
     
      
    40 WILLIAM HAROLD MATHESON for the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken I sentence you to a non-parole period of eighteen years to commence on 19 May 2004 and to expire on 18 May 2022. The balance of your term of imprisonment will be nine years, expiring on 18 May 2031, a total sentence of twenty-seven years.

     Judgment 
      
    1 HIDDEN and GREG JAMES JJ: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the asserted inadequacy of sentences passed in the District Court upon the respondent, Horace James Donovan, in respect of the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Escape from lawful custody (s310D of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , maximum sentence ten years imprisonment); 
         
        (2) Robbery in company, inflicting grievous bodily harm (s98 of the  
        Crimes Act, 
         maximum sentence twenty five years); 
         
        (3) Robbery in company with wounding (also s98 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , with the same maximum sentence); 
         
        (4) Take and drive conveyance without consent of the owner (deemed larceny under s154A of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , maximum sentence five years); 
         
        (5) Knowingly carried in conveyance taken without the consent of the owner (also s154A of the  
        Crimes Act, 
         carrying the same maximum sentence). 
        
       
      
    2 The primary judge sentenced the applicant as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Escape from lawful custody: imprisonment for a fixed term of one year, dating from 13 November 2000; 
         
        (2) Robbery in company, inflicting grievous bodily harm: imprisonment for three and a half years, with a non-parole period of two years, dating from 13 November 2001; 
         
        (3) Robbery in company with wounding: imprisonment for three years, with a non-parole period of two years, also dating from 13 November 2001; 
         
        (4) and (5) Deemed larceny of motor vehicles: on each, imprisonment for a fixed term of eighteen months, again dating from 13 November 2001. 
        
       
       
      The overall effective sentence, then, was imprisonment for four and a half years, with a non-parole period of three years, dating from 13 November 2000.  
       
      
    3 The offences were committed with three co-offenders: Clarence Frederick Donovan (the respondent’s cousin), Raymond James Dungay and Brett Neville Dickson. Clarence Donovan and Raymond Dungay were sentenced by his Honour at the same time as the respondent. Both were dealt with for the charge of escape from lawful custody and the two robbery charges, together with related charges in respect of the two motor vehicles. The respondent and Clarence Donovan had pleaded guilty to the escape charge and the charges in respect of the motor vehicles, but not guilty to the robbery charges. After a joint trial, both were found guilty of those charges. Raymond Dungay had pleaded guilty to all charges. 
     
      
    4 For his part in the incident, Brett Dickson had earlier pleaded guilty to a somewhat different set of charges. The sentences passed upon him were also the subject of a Crown appeal, which was successful: R v Dickson [2002] NSWCCA 327. Judgment in that appeal was delivered before his Honour sentenced the respondent and the other two offenders, and it will be necessary to refer to it later.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 His Honour recited the facts which he found for the purpose of sentence in his remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        At about 8 pm on Saturday 14 October 2000 the offenders and a man called Dixon (sic) were inmates of the Grafton Correctional Centre, housed in the minimum security unit section. The offenders forcibly escaped from the gaol with Dixon by smashing a window of the unit which released them from that minimum security unit section, but they then found themselves still inside part of the prison. The four of them went to the exterior glass doors of the periodic detention centre and smashed their way out of there onto Arthur Street opposite the Grafton Base Hospital and diagonally opposite the Albion Hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        Coincidentally, and unfortunately for them, the two victims of these offences were close to the outside part of the prison. The younger of the two victims, Cameron McMillan, then aged 19, had attended at the Grafton Hospital because he had injured his leg during a cricket match that day. He had telephoned his mother, Elizabeth McMillan, a woman then aged 47, and asked her to come to the hospital and to pick him up because he could not drive. 
        
       
       
        
        The escapees immediately saw the opportunity of seizing a car and escaping. They may not have done so, one imagines, if they had not been fired up on illicit alcohol of the “jungle juice” variety which they had somehow brewed up illicitly inside the prison. But in any event the three of them immediately launched an attack upon Elizabeth McMillan and on her son who, it seems, were simply standing near the vehicles intending to drive off. One of the escapees attempted to start the vehicle but could not do so because of a security switch. 
        
       
       
        
        During the attack, Cameron McMillan was dragged from the vehicle and repeatedly beaten by three of the offenders. He was “king hit”, that is to say struck a heavy blow in the head while being held by the other two. He was given a thorough belting. He suffered a fractured right cheekbone, lacerated internal and external right ear and bruising to the head and body. He was subsequently admitted to the high dependency unit of the Grafton Base Hospital whence he had just come with some minor difficulty with his leg. The injuries he suffered as a result of this attack were very serious and clearly amounted in law to grievous bodily harm.  
        
       
       
        
        The mother, Elizabeth McMillan, was beaten and flung to the ground at the rear of her vehicle between two vehicles where she was struck about the head by one of the offenders by an object he was holding in his right hand. No object of the kind capable of being used in such an attack was in fact found at or near the site when subsequently searched, but I conclude that she was not only punched and kicked but she was struck by something. It is impossible to say by whom. As she lay motionless in the gutter at the rear of her vehicle, she was, I conclude, kicked about the head and body in a separate round of attack and stomped to the head by one of the escapees. I have no doubt that that part of the attack was committed by the offender Dungay. Elizabeth McMillan suffered concussion, a lacerated scalp and a bruising to the face and body and was admitted to hospital for treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        Being unable to start one vehicle, the escapees obtained the keys to the car next to it. The one they actually managed to steal was the one previously driven by Cameron McMillan. The four of them left the area in that vehicle which was later located near Glen Innes prison farm on the Gwyder Highway after having been involved in a single car accident. 
        
       
       
        
        There was then another car stolen which gives rise to one of the various car charges involved in this exercise. 
        
       
      
    6 The charge of robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm related to Cameron McMillan, and the charge of robbery in company with wounding to his mother. Although the offenders’ primary concern appears to have been to secure a car to make good their escape, the property the subject of each charge was a sum of money. It is those undoubtedly serious offences which are the focus of the present appeal. His Honour went on in his remarks to examine in greater detail the facts of the robberies and their effect upon the unfortunate victims, but it is unnecessary to repeat that exercise for the purpose of deciding the appeal. Nor is it necessary to refer to the circumstances in which the four offenders were apprehended and returned to custody. It is sufficient to say that the respondent surrendered to police about a week later. 
     
      
    7 His Honour made findings about the level of culpability of each of the three offenders with whom he was dealing. Of Raymond Dungay he said: 
     
      
       
        
        Dungay was the ringleader who broke the glass in the window, kicked in a door and who principally effected the escape. After that he urged the others on to violence. He participated in punching the male victim and he was the principal, if not the only, attacker against the female victim. 
        
       
       
      He saw Dungay as deserving of the most severe punishment of the three men. 
       
      
    8 Of Clarence Donovan, his Honour said that he: 
     
      
       
        
        … although not directly involved in the attack on the female victim, was a principal in the attack on the male victim… Whether he or Dickson king hit the male victim is unclear, but I have no doubt that Clarence Donovan certainly punched and beat him. 
        
       
      
    9 What his Honour said about the culpability of the respondent should be set out in full: 
     
      
       
        
        Horace Donovan is the least culpable of the offenders in relation to the attacks on both the male and female victims. He left the jail somewhat after the other escapees and he lagged behind them at a sufficient distance for a sufficient space of time such that the independent witnesses, including the victim Cameron McMillan, did not observe him directly involved in the melee. I find that he did not directly strike or attack either victim. His liability arises by the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. The jury found, and I agree, that he was present and assisting before the assaults on the victims had been completed and his presence was some encouragement, albeit I find minor. The doctrine of joint criminal responsibility permits of considerable flexibility in sentencing according to the role of particular participants. So far as Horace Donovan is concerned, he is to be seen as within the net of legal liability but at the edge of the net and he will be sentenced accordingly. 
        
       
      
    10 Generally, his Honour saw the offences as objectively very serious, noting that the robbery offences were committed in company, involved “gratuitous cruelty” and caused the victims “considerable physical injury and emotional shock”. He also observed that those offences (and the offences involving motor vehicles) were aggravated by having been committed by escapees from prison. On the other hand, he found that the offences had been “hatched up over a mad drinking session” and were not “sensibly planned”. Noting that all of the offenders were due to be released in the relatively near future, he described their escape as “stupid behaviour and behaviour which no doubt they are living to regret”. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    11 For the purpose of the appeal, it is unnecessary to examine the respondent’s subjective case in any detail. He was twenty years old at the time of the offences, and is now twenty-three. He has a reasonably long criminal record, which includes some prior convictions for offences of violence (although none anything like as serious as the aggravated robbery offences). He is Aboriginal, and his Honour saw his record as consistent with a “troubled background of deprivation” of the kind referred to in R v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58.  
     
      
    12 Two weeks prior to the escape his mother had died of a heart attack at the age of forty-two. He had been allowed to attend her funeral but his grief had remained unabated. Clarence Donovan and Raymond Dungay observed that he was unable to speak about the loss of his mother and was becoming depressed. It is against this emotional background that the drinking session on the day of the escape must be understood. The respondent also smoked some marijuana, to which he was unaccustomed. His Honour found that the respondent and the other two offenders whom he had to sentence, all young Aboriginal men, were “deeply distressed by imprisonment”, having come from a background “where family closeness generated particular stresses”. 
     
      
    13 His Honour had regard to the respondent’s pleas of guilty to the escape charge and the motor vehicle charges and, as is apparent from the sentences which he passed, found special circumstances. There is no complaint about these matters in the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Co-offenders 
       
      
    14 The subjective cases of Raymond Dungay and Clarence Donovan were similar in relevant respects to that of the respondent. Both of those men also were beset by family problems of one kind or another at the time of the escape. The distinction between the sentences passed upon them and upon the respondent was based upon his Honour’s findings about the measure of their culpability, outlined above. There has been no Crown appeal against their sentences.  
     
      
    15 Raymond Dungay was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of seven years. On the charge of robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six years. On the charge of robbery in company with wounding, he was sentenced to a partly cumulative term of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years.  
     
      
    16 Clarence Donovan was sentenced to terms aggregating imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years. On the charge of robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. On the charge of robbery with wounding, he was sentenced to a partly cumulative term of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. 
     
      
    17 As we have said, Brett Dickson had been dealt with by another judge and the sentences imposed upon him were increased by this Court after a Crown appeal. Apart from the charge of escape, he had pleaded guilty to robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm in respect of Cameron McMillan (s96 of the Crimes Act, maximum sentence twenty five years) and robbery with the infliction of actual bodily harm in relation to Mrs McMillan (s95 of the Crimes Act, maximum sentence twenty years). He had taken into account on a Form 1 a charge of deemed larceny of the motor vehicle at Grafton. (He was not involved in the taking of the second vehicle.) 
     
      
    18 Both at first instance and on appeal, Mr Dickson was dealt with on the following basis: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that he became involved in the escape at the last minute; 
         
        (b) that he got into a car in which Cameron McMillan was seated and hit him (although he was not the one who “king hit” him); and 
         
        (c) that, after Mr McMillan had been removed from the car, he tried unsuccessfully to start it. 
        
       
       
      He is Aboriginal and it appears that he also had a deprived background, although it may be that the evidence about this was not entirely satisfactory: see the judgment of Meagher JA in the appeal at par 13. 
       
       
      
    19 In the District Court, on each of the robbery charges (taking into account the matter on the Form 1), Mr Dickson was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. On the escape charge he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for eighteen months, concurrent with the non-parole period in respect of the robbery charges. On appeal, the sentencing judge was found to have erred in a number of respects, including the fact that the sentence on the escape charge was wholly concurrent with those passed in respect of the robbery charges: s57(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    20 However, what is significant for present purposes is that the Court found that the sentences on the robbery charges were manifestly inadequate. The sentences were re-assessed and restructured, resulting in an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years and nine months. This involved an increase of the sentence on the charge of robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of four years and nine months and, on the charge of robbery with the infliction of actual bodily harm, to a partly cumulative term of imprisonment of four years with a non-parole period of one year and nine months. 
     
      
    21 Meagher JA described the robbery offences as “extremely serious and very revolting crimes, injurious to the health of the victims to the extent that, very easily with a slight change in circumstances, a fatality could have been involved” (par 15). Howie J (at par 28) expressed the view that the effective sentence which had been substituted was the least which could have been imposed, given that it was the product of a Crown appeal, and that it was less than that which should have been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    22 Before us, no complaint was made about the sentences in respect of the escape and motor vehicle charges. The thrust of the appeal is that the sentences passed upon the respondent in respect of the robbery charges are manifestly inadequate. In particular, the Crown prosecutor in this Court argued that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) in assessing the respondent’s culpability, his Honour does not appear to have had regard to evidence suggesting that it was he who first got into a car outside the prison and tried to start it, knowing that his companions were inflicting violence upon someone; 
         
        (b) in any event, his Honour’s finding about the limited role of the respondent did not justify sentences so much shorter than those passed upon Raymond Dungay and Clarence Donovan; 
         
        (c) his Honour failed to have due regard to the sentences imposed by this Court upon Brett Dickson, whose culpability was not markedly different from that of the respondent;  
         
        (d) his Honour did not advert to the guideline judgment in  
        R v Henry 
         (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, which was applicable even though the charges were robbery in company, rather than armed robbery:  
        R v Murchie 
         (1999) 108 A Crim R 482;  
         
        (e) his Honour gave undue weight to the respondent’s subjective case, so that the sentences fail adequately to reflect the objective gravity of the crimes; and  
         
        (f) the sentences on the two charges should not have been wholly concurrent. 
        
       
      
    23 It is convenient to deal immediately with the first and last of those arguments. It is true that his Honour did not refer to evidence that the respondent was the first to attempt to start a car, at a time when he was aware of the violent behaviour of at least some of his co-offenders. However, that does not appear to me to be a significant matter for present purposes. That evidence points towards the respondent’s criminal responsibility for the violent behaviour of his companions, a finding inherent in the jury’s verdict on each charge. It was upon that basis that his Honour sentenced him. However, it remained open to his Honour to have regard to the fact that the respondent himself inflicted no violence in determining the appropriate measure of his punishment.  
     
      
    24 It was also open to his Honour to direct that the sentences on the two robbery charges be served concurrently, given the respondent’s limited involvement and the fact that the offences were committed in the course of the same criminal episode. The Crown prosecutor took us to the now familiar principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. However, his Honour expressly referred to that case in his remarks and nothing in the High Court’s decision fetters the discretion of a sentencing judge to determine whether sentences should be served concurrently or cumulatively, in whole or in part. Nor does it appear to us that his Honour’s hands were tied in that respect by the fact that this Court directed the partial accumulation of the sentences imposed upon Brett Dickson. Of course, this leaves open the question whether the sentences are manifestly inadequate individually, or in combination as a reflection of the total criminality of the episode. 
     
      
    25 As to the comparison between the respondent’s sentences and those passed upon Raymond Dungay and Clarence Donovan, it is true that the distinction is marked but, in the light of his Honour’s careful examination of the roles of each of the three offenders, a significant distinction was warranted. As to this Court’s decision in respect of Brett Dickson, his Honour acknowledged it, saying that what the Court had said in that case “cannot and will not be ignored by me.” He went on to observe, however, that there were “points of factual distinction” between Dickson and the three offenders he was to sentence. No doubt, it was to these distinctions that his Honour was referring when he later said that he did not regard himself “as being bound in detail by that decision …”. Clearly, the respondent was entitled to be dealt with more leniently than Dickson. Dickson was directly involved in the infliction of violence upon Cameron McMillan, having struck him, and it would seem that he was not able to make out as favourable a subjective case as the respondent. 
     
      
    26 It would have been appropriate for his Honour to have regard to the Henry guideline, although it should be borne in mind that that guideline does not expressly deal with a person who is not the principal offender and whose criminal liability is founded upon the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise or common purpose. All that said, the ultimate question to be determined is whether the sentences on the robbery charges are manifestly inadequate. About that we have wavered. The sentences are markedly lenient. However, after careful reflection, we are not persuaded that they were so far outside the range as to call for this Court’s intervention on a Crown appeal.  
     
      
    27 This was an unusual case, given the respondent’s limited role, as his Honour found it, and the emotional background arising from his recent bereavement. That background was of particular significance and, generally, it does not appear to us that his Honour afforded the respondent’s subjective case more weight than it deserved. Given the well recognised constraints upon this Court’s intervention in an appeal such as this, any adjustment which might be made to the sentences would be of limited significance, such as to be unwarranted in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    28 In so far as we have wavered about the question of inadequacy, we should add that, in any event, we would have dismissed this appeal in the exercise of this Court’s residual discretion. The Notice of Appeal was filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions within a reasonable time after sentence was passed. However, there was considerable delay in the District Court proceedings coming to finality. The offences were committed in October 2000. The respondent’s trial took place in September 2002. There were then a number of adjournments of the sentence proceedings, so that sentence was not passed until 6 June 2003. The cause of this delay is not apparent from the material before us, and we should say that there is nothing to suggest that it should be sheeted home to the Crown. 
     
      
    29 The result, however, is that the respondent faces this Crown appeal in respect of sentences which commenced in November 2000 and November 2001. He would be eligible for release on parole in the very near future. We would be reluctant, by allowing the appeal, to delay the opportunity to foster by a period of supervised liberty the rehabilitation of an offender who is still a very young man. 
     
      
    30 We would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    31 SMART AJ: The facts and circumstances and the contentions of the parties are set out in the judgment of Hidden and Greg James JJ. 
     
      
    32 Mr H J Donovan was engaged in a criminal enterprise of much gravity. During the robbery in company grievous bodily harm was inflicted upon Mr Cameron McMillan (count 2). After being dragged from a vehicle he was severely and repeatedly beaten. He suffered a fractured right cheekbone, lacerated internal and external right ear and bruising to the head and body. He was rendered unconscious. After being treated in the Emergency Department he was transferred to the intensive care unit of Grafton Base Hospital. He spent some days in hospital and needed subsequent operative care. The report of Dr G R Varley, consultant general surgeon highlights the seriousness of the injuries suffered. 
     
      
    33 During the robbery in company with wounding Mrs Elizabeth McMillan was beaten and flung to the ground (count 3). She was struck about the head by one of the offenders by an object. She was punched and kicked about the head and body and stomped to the head by one of the escapees. The stomping was the work of the offender, Dungay. Mrs McMillan was hospitalised from 14 to 20 October 2000 (both inclusive). She suffered a lacerated scalp and bruising to the face and body. Dr Varley wrote that she had ""a serious head injury evidenced by the considerable bleeding she had around both orbits."" She had a considerable problem with dizziness. 
     
      
    34 The effects on each victim of the offence committed against that victim were marked and far reaching. The particular role played by Mr H J Donovan did not appear with clarity from the materials. He gave this account in his record of interview of what happened after he left the gaol and came on to the street outside it. 
     
      
       
        
        ... when I come out onto the street I seen, seen the boys there sort of like wrestlin around and that. So I stood back and, to see what was goin' on, but I couldn't, couldn't really see what was goin' on. It was, pretty, pretty dark at the time. So um, I – um, I wanted to get, get out of it, so I ran to a car and um, I jumped, jumped, jumped in, in the driver's seat. I couldn't get, couldn't get the car going. Then I jumped out and come back around. I could see the boys fightin'. I didn't know who, who it was there that was fightin' at the time .Uhm You know, I just, I seen them laying on, on the ground there and I, and I looked at them I heard them, heard them snoring sort of like, snoring and that and sort of like gargling, like something like that, you know, snoring, snoring and that. The boys are just, the boys are just still wrestlin' and that and throwin' punches and kicks and all that sort of stuff and I started, strated ( 
        sic) 
         freakin' out and I said, Boys, youse are fuckin' gunna kill him, youse killed him, youse killed him. I just freaked right out on them and that and they um, they um, they had one of the cars got started up and um, I was there, just, just froz and that you know, 'cause I thought, I thought they was gunna die. I thought they were dead, and um, I started goin' off at the boys and that and um, they grabbed me and they threw me, they threw me in the back of the car and um, that's when we, we was headin' headin; somewhere. I didn't know where we were going. 
        
       
      
    35 Notwithstanding that Mr H J Donovan was a minor player in the enterprise and his subjective features, the sentences imposed by the judge in respect of counts 2 and 3 were below the minimum sentences which could be sensibly imposed. There are two outstanding features of the offences, namely, the high level of violence and the extent of the injuries. Mr H J Donovan was a participant in each of them, albeit in a minor role. These offences were committed in the course of the four offenders making good their escape from gaol. 
     
      
    36 Making the sentences on counts 2 and 3 wholly concurrent does not adequately reflect the total criminality involved in the offences and the result is one which is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion there was manifest error in making the overly lenient sentences on counts 2 and 3 wholly concurrent. The sentences should have been partly cumulative. 
     
      
    38 The judge correctly found special circumstances. The next question which arises is whether this Court should, in the exercise of its residual discretion, decline to interfere principally because of the delay in the proceedings in the lower Courts. The offences were committed on 14 October 2000. I do not know when the committal proceedings took place. The trial took place between 9-13 September 2002. The papers do not explain why the trial took nearly two years to begin. In respect of the delay between September 2002 and June 2003 part at least of that delay was due to the unavailability of counsel for the offenders. The judge tried to overcome this and was anxious to proceed to sentence at an early date. 
     
      
    39 In the absence of full information as to the reasons for the delay I am reluctant to rely on this as a powerful factor. It should not be assumed that the offenders wanted early finalisation of the matters. The judge, after a hearing on sentence on 29 May and 2 June 2003, imposed the various sentences on 6 June 2003. The Crown's Notice of Appeal was served on 12 July 2003. That was timely. With the escape and the two robberies Mr H J Donovan should have expected lengthy sentences. 
     
      
    40 In any event these offences are so serious that delay of the order which occurred in the present case should not lead to the Court exercising its residual discretion to dismiss these appeals. 
     
      
    41 In considering the question of totality I have borne in mind that the accused was in gaol for other offences from 25 October 1999 until his escape on 14 October 2000 and that he was due for release on 25 October 2000. The sentence on count 3 should be partly accumulative on that imposed on count 2. The extent of that partial accumulation should be 18 months. Because of that partial accumulation there will need to be an adjustment to the non-parole period on count 3. The overall effect of what I propose will be head sentences totalling 5 years 6 months and non-parole periods of 4 years. These are still lenient sentences. They are only so lenient because of re-sentencing and the restraint which this Court exercises on re-sentencing. Lesser sentences than those proposed could not be imposed. 
     
      
    42 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          1. Crown appeal against the sentences imposed on counts 1, 2, 4, and 5 dismissed 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on count 3 (robbery in company with wounding) allowed in part, sentence quashed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. In lieu of the sentence imposed on count 3 Horace James Donovan is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years commencing from 13 May 2003 with a non-parole period of 18 months starting that day and ending on 12 November 2004 on which day Mr Donovan will be eligible for release on parole.

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offences and sentence
Two applications were before the Court. The first in point of time was an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge in the District Court at Sydney on 14 September 2002. The second was an application for leave to appeal against sentence by the respondent on the basis of error disclosed in the sentencing process and that the overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances.

2The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated break enter and steal and one count of attempted aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years; four counts of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years; one deemed supply of a prohibited drug, contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years; two counts of using a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years and one count of attempting to use a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. Also taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act), were 19 offences of a similar kind.

3The details of the offences and the sentences imposed are set out in the Table below. The respondent was sentenced to a total head sentence of 4 years 8 months with a total non-parole period of 3 years and 11 months.

4The Crown relies upon the following Grounds of Appeal.

1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to find as an aggravating feature on sentence that the offences were committed while the respondent was subject to conditional liberty.
2. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 offences.
3. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences.
4. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the respondent's prior record of offending.
5. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.
6. The sentences, individually and as structured, are manifestly inadequate.

5The respondent relied upon the following Grounds of Appeal.

1. The sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to the finding of special circumstances for the total aggregate sentence.
2. The sentence imposed for the deemed supply charge is in error as the objective criminality cannot be determined in the absence of any nominated quantity of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine.
3. The overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances of the offences, for reasons including:
The sentences for three use false instrument charges were each excessive, and
The delayed commencement of the sentence on 16th January 2012.

Factual Background

6On 18 February 2010 the respondent rented a Toyota Camry in the name of his de facto partner. At 1.20am on 19 February 2010 the respondent and a co-offender walked to a pharmacy in Carwar Avenue, Carrs Park. Both offenders were wearing balaclavas. CCTV recorded the offenders using the concrete lid of a Telstra pit to smash the glass of the pharmacy door. Both offenders entered and took all the cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. They then left the premises and drove away in the rented Camry (aggravated BES Seq 1).

7At about 1.40am on 19 February 2010 the two offenders drove along President Avenue, Caringbah and stopped outside the Caringbah Pharmacy. By this time the Camry's registration plates had been obscured. The offenders used a concrete Telstra pit cover to smash the glass door and stole all the cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. They then left in the Camry (aggravated BES Seq 2).

8At about 2.10am on 19 February 2010 the offenders were seen near the Miranda Pharmacy at 96 Kiora Road, Miranda. The respondent was carrying a suitcase and black gloves. He fled when a police patrol came by, but dropped a black glove which yielded his DNA. The co-offender was arrested (attempted aggravated BES Seq 3).

9The Camry was located in a nearby street. The registration plates were covered. Inside the car were 142 boxes of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is a prohibited drug that is used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Also found in the car were 25 bottles of cough medicine stolen from the pharmacy.

10On 16 August 2010 the respondent attended the Meadows Pharmacy at Claremont Meadows and presented a false driver's licence. He asked for a packet of Claratyne 12 hour tablets (which contain pseudoephedrine). The pharmacist refused to serve him and he left (attempt to use false document to obtain property Seq 9).

11On 10 October 2010 the respondent, using another false driver's licence, attended the Terry White Pharmacy at Plumpton and bought a packet of Codral Day and Night tablets (which contain pseudoephedrine) (use false document to obtain property Seq 6).

12On 21 October 2010 the respondent rented an Audi A4 in a false name (using one of the false driver's licences). At 12.54am he attended Harbord Pharmacy, Harbord and used a block of bricks to smash in the door. He entered and removed an amount of pseudoephedrine (BES Seq 7). 

13On 28 October 2010 at 11.12pm the respondent attended the Pitt Street Medical Centre, Merrylands. He smashed the glass door with a Telstra pit cover and stole 35 packets of pseudoephedrine based products (BES Seq 13).

14On 20 November 2010 the respondent drove his de facto's car to the Mulgoa Pharmacy, Mulgoa. The registration plates were covered with a pair of shorts. The respondent took a concrete Telstra pit cover from the car and smashed in the door of the pharmacy and stole all the pseudoephedrine based products on display (about 40 packets) (BES Seq 22).

15On 23 November 2010 the respondent drove his de facto's car to the Werrington County Pharmacy, Werrington. He stopped and picked up a concrete Telstra pit cover. The respondent stole approximately 70 packets of pseudoephedrine based products (BES Seq 25).

16On 30 November 2010 the respondent entered the Pulse Pharmacy, Parramatta and used a false driver's licence to purchase a packet of Chemists Own Sinus Relief tablets which contain pseudoephedrine (use false document to obtain property Seq 27).

17On 2 December 2010 a search warrant was executed on the respondent's residential premises. Police located a total of 110 packets of pseudoephedrine based products in the respondent's home. The respondent participated in a recorded interview and made full admissions to owning all the pseudoephedrine based products and certain admissions relating to the fraud offences.

18A further 19 offences were taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s32 of the Sentencing Act. These comprised 3 counts of break enter with intent, contrary to s113(1) Crimes Act 1900; 1 attempted break enter and steal, contrary to s113(1) Crimes Act 1900; 3 counts of intentionally damaging property, contrary to s195(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (the properties being the premises broken into for the break and enter with intent offences); and 12 counts of using a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900.

Respondent's subjective case

19The respondent was aged 32 at the date of the offences. He had a stable childhood but encountered learning difficulties at school and left in year 9. His employment has been sporadic, mainly driving courier trucks.

20The respondent started drinking alcohol at the age of 15, which later became problematic. By the age of 26 he told the Probation and Parole Service that he was drinking a case of beer everyday, along with spirits. He said that this level of drinking only ceased when he was in prison. He started using amphetamines in 2001 (aged 23) and the only time that he did not use amphetamines was when he was in prison. The respondent said that he had a chronic gambling problem and every day would gamble large amounts on poker machines, horses and greyhounds.

21The respondent had an extensive criminal history in NSW that started in 1996 when he was 17 years old. He had numerous convictions for driving offences (including 6 convictions for dangerous driving), high range PCA, break enter and steal, numerous fraud offences and stealing. He had been imprisoned on a number of occasions.

22The respondent also had numerous convictions in Victoria for possess material to manufacture a drug of dependence, burglary, theft, threaten serious injury and trafficking a drug of dependence.

23In 2009 the respondent was convicted in Queensland of fraud, stealing and break and enter type offences. The respondent has also spent periods in prison in Victoria and Queensland.

24At the date of committing all of the offences before the Court, the respondent was serving a suspended sentence for the Queensland offences.

25On 7 March 2010 the respondent was granted bail in NSW for (unrelated) driving offences, so that the offences that occurred after that date were committed while the respondent was on bail.

26The respondent was arrested and remanded in custody in relation to the subject offences on 2 December 2010. He had a number of outstanding driving charges (unrelated to these matters) and on 30 September 2011 the respondent was sentenced to a head sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 13 ½ months which expired on 16 January 2012. He was then remanded in custody on the subject matters.

27A psychological assessment, dated 24 July 2012, prepared by Claire Wood psychologist, reported that he had a stable childhood in Sydney but struggled at school and left in year 9. He had two brothers, both of whom were also in custody. He started consuming alcohol at the age of 15. He had three children but was separated from their mother.

28He told Ms Wood of his heavy drinking and uncontrolled gambling and an addiction to amphetamines. She confirmed that he suffered from substance abuse disorder. She noted that he had no insight into his alcohol and drug dependence and on release from his earlier imprisonments, felt no remorse and wished to resume his previous lifestyle. Although there was no previous diagnosis of mental illness, Ms Wood thought that he displayed traits consistent with ""internal distortions, interpersonal difficulties contributing to maladaptive behaviours in line with Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders"".

29Ms Wood prepared a second report, dated 2 September 2012, in which she suggested programs from which the respondent would benefit.

30A personal reference by Ms Moore, the respondent's ex-partner, was placed before the court which confirmed his drug and gambling addiction. The respondent wrote a letter to the court in which he expressed his regret for his actions and referred to his drug, alcohol and gambling addictions.

31A pre-sentence report was tendered. It described the respondent's very poor response to previous supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and noted that his periods of supervision were characterised by re-offending and a failure to address his offending behaviour.

Remarks on sentence

32The respondent came before Acting Judge Puckeridge for sentence on 4 September 2012. His Honour handed down sentence on 14 September 2012. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour recited the facts of the offending and the salient aspects of the respondent's subjective case. His Honour referred to the need for a sentence to take into account general and specific deterrence. His Honour noted that there was a standard non-parole period of 5 years applicable to the aggravated BES offences (Sequences 1 and 2) and noted that the ""offences are objectively serious"".

33His Honour gave a discount of 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.

34When sentencing for Sequences 1, 2 and 3 the sentencing judge said:

""I have come to the conclusion that taking into account the Form 1 it would be appropriate that an aggregate sentence of 5 years would be appropriate. That is a sentence which would have to be reduced for the pleas of guilty and the Crown concedes that there would need or not need, but it would be appropriate that there would be a full 25 percent discount which would reduce that to 45 months. The Court is also required to indicate what the sentences would be but for the aggregate sentence in relation to those three offences."" (ROS 4.9 - 5.2)

35His Honour held that a head sentence of 5 years (before the discount for the pleas of guilty) was appropriate for each of the three s112(2) offences committed on 19 February 2010. His Honour noted that there was planning involved in each offence. He also noted that as there were three discrete offences committed on that night, there ""was a need for cumulative sentences or partially cumulative"". His Honour then said:

""I consider that the totality of the criminality would be reflected therefore in an aggregate sentence taking into account the Form 1 matters, which I take into account in relation to such aggregate sentences which I sign and date today's date once I find the Form 1.""

36His Honour commenced the sentences from 16 January 2012 being the date of expiry of the non-parole period for the unrelated driving offences. His Honour then set a single non-parole period for all three s112(2) offences of 32 months or 71 percent of the head sentence. 

37His Honour found special circumstances, by reason of the respondent's need for intensive support on his release to address his addictions. Notwithstanding this finding, the total non-parole period was 83 percent of the total head sentence.

38His Honour set a sentence of 12 months for Sequence 9 (attempt to use a false instrument) with a starting date of 16 March 2012. As the entire term of that sentence was subsumed within the aggregate non-parole period set for the s112(2) offences, his Honour declined to set a non-parole period.

39In relation to Sequence 6 (use false instrument to obtain property) his Honour imposed a sentence of 15 months, to date from 16 March 2012. As the entire term of that sentence was subsumed within the aggregate non-parole period set for the s112(2) offences, his Honour declined to set a non-parole period.

40In relation to the four break enter and steal offences (Sequences 7, 13, 22 and 25) his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of 33 months after the discount for the plea of guilty was applied with an aggregate non-parole period of 2 years. The aggregate sentence was to commence on 16 July 2013 (that is 16 months accumulation on the first aggregate sentence). The individual sentences imposed (after a discount of 25 percent) were described as:
Sequence 7 - 33 months;
Sequence 13 - 33 months with a non-parole period of 24 months.
Sequence 22 - 42 months reduced by 20 percent (his Honour did not calculate the final term but it is 31.5 months).
Sequence 25 - 33 months.

41In relation to Sequence 27 (use a false document to obtain property) the sentencing judge imposed a head sentence of 15 months with a non-parole period of 11 months starting 16 October 2014.

42For the deemed supply, his Honour imposed a head sentence of 18 months. His Honour then said that in order to give effect to his finding of special circumstances and to avoid a crushing sentence, a non-parole period of 9 months was appropriate (50 percent of the head sentence) to date from 16 March 2015. His Honour noted that a period of 10 months on parole would be sufficient for the respondent to obtain a proper treatment program.

THE APPEALS
Crown Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to find as an aggravating feature on sentence that the offences were committed while the respondent was subject to conditional liberty.

43By way of further background, on 9 October 2009 the respondent was sentenced to a 4 year suspended sentence by the Brisbane District Court. The s112(2) offences (Sequences 1, 2 and 3) were committed on 19 February 2010 during the currency of that suspended sentence. On 7 March 2010 the respondent was granted bail for unrelated driving offences. All of the offences after that date were committed while he was on bail. This includes all of the Form 1 offences.

44In relation to the s112(2) offences, his Honour said, after having sentenced the respondent:

""... In relation to the first charges in which there was a question as to whether or not, he being on conditional liberty from Queensland, whether that was an aggravating feature and in respect of which the court was given no authority, I did not make any finding in relation to whether or not it was an aggravating feature, I simply took it into account, together with the standard non-parole period in relation to certainly Sequences 2 and 1, with the standard non-parole period, and considered that was appropriate in those circumstances. I just wanted to make that clear."" (ROS 16.8)

45The appellant submitted that his Honour made no reference anywhere in his remarks to the fact that the balance of the offences were committed while the respondent was on bail. The appellant submitted that s21A(2)(j) of the Sentencing Act provides that this is an aggravating feature to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence if the offences were committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty.

46The appellant relied on Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [86] where Johnson J said:

""86 In Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81 at [24], it was held that the commission of an offence, whilst the offender was subject to a s10 good behaviour bond, constituted the aggravating factor listed in s21A(2)(j) of the Act regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed. However, it was not the case in Frigiani v R that the offence for which the s10 good behaviour bond had been granted was one for which imprisonment was not an available sentence. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the purpose of s21A(2)(j) is to capture the common law principle that an offence committed whilst a person is subject to conditional liberty, whether on bail or whilst subject to a good behaviour bond or a community service order or periodic detention or parole, constitutes an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentence. The essence of the provision is that the offender commits a further offence whilst subject to an order of a court in criminal proceedings requiring, amongst other things, that the offender be of good behaviour. I do not consider that the term ""conditional liberty"" in the section is confined to circumstances where the foundational offence giving rise to the conditional liberty is one which itself must be punishable by imprisonment.

87 Even if this view was wrong, however, the common law principle remains applicable given that s 21A does not purport to codify the law in this area: s 21A(1). Even if the commission of the offences whilst the Applicant was subject to a s 10 good behaviour bond for trespass did not constitute the statutory aggravating factor, it would constitute an available aggravating factor at common law. ...""

47The appellant noted that in Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183 at [18] and [70] this Court had recognised that s21A(2)(j) applies where the order imposing conditional liberty was imposed by a court in another Australian jurisdiction.

48The appellant submitted that this was a serious error on the part of the sentencing judge. By reference to Attorney General's Application (No 1) Under s26 of the Criminal Appeal Act; R v Ponfield; R v Scott; R v Ryan; R v Johnson [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 (the guideline judgment on breaking and entering) at [48] the first matter identified as an important consideration was whether the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. The appellant submitted that not only had his Honour erred in the manner specified, but the error was a serious one which must have affected the sentencing process.

49The respondent submitted that during the sentencing proceedings the Crown made no objection to the way in which his Honour indicated that he would treat the fact that the s112(2) offences were committed while the respondent was on conditional liberty. He submitted that if the Crown's acquiescence led the sentencing judge into error, that should not be held against him. In that regard, the respondent referred to Everett and Phillips v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 300 where four judges of the High Court (Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron JJ) held that in an application by the Crown for leave to appeal against sentence, the Crown was bound by the stance which it had taken in the sentencing proceedings. The respondent also noted that in the passage referred to by the Crown, his Honour said that he would take that matter into account.

50It is clear that his Honour did not receive the assistance to which he was entitled in relation to the Queensland suspended sentence. As a result, I am not persuaded that his Honour gave that fact very much weight in relation to the s112(2) offences. Nevertheless, because of the stance adopted by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings, if that were the only difficulty with his Honour's approach to the sentences for those offences, I would not be prepared to intervene.

51I do, however, agree that in relation to the sentences for the balance of the offences, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that after March 2010 the respondent was on bail. In that regard, his Honour was in error. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 2. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 offences.

52The appellant submitted that his Honour failed to properly take the Form 1 offences into account as required by Attorney-General's Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. It submitted that this was clear from the indicative sentences. When specifying the sentences that would have been imposed for Sequences 1, 2 and 3 had the aggregate sentence procedure not been utilised, his Honour said that he would have imposed a 5 year head sentence for each offence. The appellant submitted that this involved error since the Form 1 offences were to be taken into account when sentencing for the offence in Sequence 1.

53The appellant submitted that this was the error identified in R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219. There McClellan CJ at CL said:

""29 It will be apparent from the portions that I have related from the sentencing judge's remarks that there are a number of errors. The sentencing judge concluded that each offence was of similar seriousness and gave no indication of the impact of the matters on the Form 1 on the sentence for the relevant offences.

...

32 Section 53A(1) allows a court to impose an aggregate sentence instead of a separate sentence of imprisonment for each count. However, s 53A(2) requires the sentencing judge to indicate to the offender the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. A sentencing judge is accordingly required to give consideration to the criminality involved in each offence and, where appropriate, have regard to any matters on a Form 1 when defining the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence. ...""

54In the same case RA Hulme J said:

""56 McClellan CJ at CL has referred (at [31] - [32]) to the provisions of s 53A, including the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) that a court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. In an apparent attempt to give effect to this requirement, the sentencing judge in this case said:


""I am imposing an aggregate sentence. In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account the discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment. There would have to be a degree of accumulation.""

57 With respect to the judge, this would appear to be doing little more than paying lip service to the requirement in s 53A(2)(b). I do not understand how the same sentence for each offence can be justified. True it is that they were offences of a similar (but not identical) nature and that the maximum penalty for each was the same. However, the judge was asked to take into account further offences when he sentenced for two of the offences; a reason in itself for the individual sentences to vary. ...""

55Hall J agreed with the reasons of both McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J in that case.

56In reply the respondent accepted that it did not appear that the sentencing judge had taken the Form 1 matters into account, unless he had done so without making specific reference to them when fixing the aggregate sentence. The respondent submitted, however, that even if error of this kind had occurred, it did not necessarily follow that the aggregate sentence should be significantly different if this error were corrected.

57As the respondent properly conceded, the sentencing judge clearly erred by not taking the Form 1 offences into account. There were 19 of them and some were serious. This question was recently considered by a bench of five in the matters of Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. There the Court emphasised the observations of Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment at [42] where his Honour said in relation to matters on the Form 1:

""42 The position, in my opinion, is that although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. ...""

58In Abbas the Chief Justice, with whom Garling and Campbell JJ and I agreed, made it clear that within specified limitations a sentencing judge was to take into account the criminality associated with the Form 1 offences - [21] - [24]. See also my remarks at [102] - [106] with which Garling and Campbell JJ agreed.

59The effect of those decisions is that for the Form 1 offences in this matter to have been taken into account, the sentence for the offence in Sequence 1 would have had to be greater than those imposed for the offences in Sequences 2 and 3. By failing to properly take the Form 1 matters into account, his Honour was in error. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences.

60The appellant accepted that there was some overlap between this ground and Ground 2. It submitted that his Honour's approach to the imposition of aggregate sentences involved two discrete errors:

His Honour nominated the same individual sentence for each of the individual offences within the first aggregate sentence.

The aggregate sentences failed to reflect considerations of totality, i.e., the aggregate sentences effectively involved the imposition of wholly concurrent sentences.

61The appellant submitted that in addition to the error of failing to take into account the Form 1 matters, the sentencing judge erred in relation to the s112(2) and s112(1) matters because he had made them almost completely concurrent in circumstances where that was not appropriate. The appellant submitted that the reasons given by his Honour for adopting that course were inadequate. It submitted that it was apparent from his reasons in respect of the s112(2) offences that his Honour misunderstood s53A of the Sentencing Act and how aggregate sentencing operated. 

62The appellant submitted that the following observation by his Honour supported that submission:

""Because they were different offences to reflect the totality involved or total criminality involved may well have been that there would have been a need for cumulative sentences or partially cumulative in any event. I consider that the totality of the criminality would be reflected therefore in an aggregate sentence taking into account the Form 1 matters which I take into account in relation to such aggregate sentences which I sign and date today's date, once I find the Form 1."" (ROS 5.8)

63In relation to the s112(1) offences, the appellant submitted that the only explanation for almost complete concurrency in those four offences was the risk that to accumulate the sentences would have a crushing effect upon the respondent, so far as any chance of rehabilitation was concerned. The appellant submitted that his Honour appeared to think that the imposition of an aggregate sentence obviated a need to consider cumulation. If he did so, he was in error. 

64The appellant relied on R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [38] where the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, RS Hulme and Hislop JJ) emphasised that concurrent sentences were not appropriate for multiple break and enter offences even where they were committed as part of a single spree of criminal behaviour. The Court affirmed that considerations of general and personal deterrence required that offenders be punished for each of their offences (see also R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 at [38]). 

65The respondent accepted that the use of s53A of the Sentencing Act might operate to allow considerations of cumulation in penalties, but submitted that it did not preclude the need to also consider matters of concurrency. The respondent accepted that even though there was a strong argument in favour of a high level of concurrency, there would have to be some cumulation to recognise that separate offences were involved. The respondent submitted that even if error had been established, it did not follow that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate.

66I agree with the Crown submission. His Honour did err in the way he approached cumulation and concurrency when applying the aggregate sentence provisions. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the respondent's prior record of offending.

67The appellant submitted that the only reference by the sentencing judge to the respondent's criminal record was to note that it disentitled him to leniency. The appellant submitted that his Honour did not (apparently) take into account that many of the respondent's previous convictions were for similar offences to those for which he was being sentenced. The appellant submitted that his Honour did not take into account the increased need for the sentence to reflect considerations of personal deterrence and retribution because of the respondent's very lengthy history of similar offences.

68The respondent submitted that the absence of any further reference to the respondent's lengthy criminal record in three States, did not mean that the sentencing judge was unaware or absent minded as to that record. The respondent noted that in the sentencing hearing the Crown spent some time going through the detail of the respondent's criminal history (T.31.31).

69While it is not clear that the sentencing judge committed the error identified by the appellant, his treatment of the respondent's criminal record was cursory at best. The relevant principles are clear and were recently restated by Hall J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) in Van Der Baan v R [2012] NSWCCA 5 at [30]:

""30 ... 

(1) The principle of proportionality as enunciated in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances: Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354; McNaughton (supra) at 572 per Spigelman CJ at [15].


(2) The proportionality principle applies so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence required: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ.


(3) The antecedent criminal history of any offender may not be used to increase the sentence beyond what is an appropriate sentence for the particular offence: Baumer v The Queen [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. 


(4) Accordingly, prior convictions do not themselves play a role in determining the gravity of the offence which, as the High Court confirmed in Hoare (supra), turns on the objective circumstances of the offence: McNaughton (supra) at [24]:


""... the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions.""

(5) Prior convictions are pertinent in terms as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ at [26] (Bell J (as her Honour then was) and Hislop J agreeing). This proposition may be seen to be reflected in references in Veen (No 2) to concepts such as an ""attitude of disobedience to the law"" and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, to ""deterrence"" (relevantly personal deterrence) and ""the protection of society"".""

70In Regina v Brett Raymond Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 Johnson J observed that it was incumbent upon judges to make clear the precise manner in which an offender's record has been taken into account:

""32 ... a passing reference to s21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without reference to the precise manner in which the sentencing judge takes that factor into account on sentence, is unsatisfactory. A failure to explain the manner in which the factor is taken into account does not enlighten the sentencing process, in a manner which s21A appears to have been designed to achieve. ...""

71While it is not clear that his Honour erred in the way asserted by the appellant I do accept that his treatment of the respondent's criminal record was not satisfactory given its extent and the similarity between prior offending and the matters for which he was being sentenced. 

Crown Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.

72This was the same as the respondent's ground 1, which was:

""The sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to the finding of special circumstances for the total aggregate sentence.""

73The Crown submitted that despite the emphasis which his Honour placed on rehabilitation, in the finding of special circumstances, the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence in relation to the total effect of the sentences was 83 percent. This ground of appeal and the respondent's Ground of Appeal 1 have been made out.

74I accept that his Honour erred in failing to give effect to his finding of special circumstances (R v Kalache [2011] NSWCCA 210 at [37].) 

Crown Ground 6. The sentences, individually and as structured, are manifestly inadequate.

75In view of the errors already identified, it is not necessary to further examine this ground. The respondent will have to be re-sentenced so that this Court will have to make its own assessment of what sentences are appropriate.

Respondent's Ground 2: The sentence imposed for the deemed supply charge is in error as the objective criminality cannot be determined in the absence of any nominated quantity of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine.

76The respondent submitted that although he had pleaded guilty to an offence of deemed supply, contrary to s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), there was no evidence of the quantity of the prohibited drug in his possession. The only evidence related to the number of packets of pseudoephedrine based products of various brands, which had been sourced from different locations. The respondent submitted that as a result, it was not possible to assess the objective criminality of this offence. This was because an important factor in this kind of offence was the quantity of the prohibited drug that is possessed or supplied. The respondent submitted that in the absence of this important information, the severity of a sentence of 18 months, after a discount of 25 percent, was excessive and not justified by those limited facts.

77The appellant's response was that s31 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act concerned indictable offences, i.e. offences not involving a commercial quantity (in the case of pseudoephedrine 1.25 kg). An indictable quantity was 25g. The appellant submitted that the respondent by his plea of guilty admitted all the elements of the charge which included that the quantity of pseudoephedrine was between the minimum indictable quantity of 25g and the maximum of 1.25 kg at which point the quantity of pseudoephedrine became a commercial quantity. The appellant submitted that the Court could infer without further information that 110 packets of pseudoephedrine based tablets would produce a quantity of pseudoephedrine greater than 25g.

78In the event that the respondent was to be re-sentenced, the appellant relied on an affidavit of Ms Williams, sworn 22 May 2013, to which was annexed a statement of Detective Inspector Iorfino. This statement was to the effect that the total amount of pure pseudoephedrine that could be extracted from 110 packets of tablets was 113.06g, which could be used to manufacture approximately 791.3g of methylamphetamine.

79Since it was common ground that the respondent would have to be re-sentenced, the Crown is entitled to rely upon that affidavit. To the extent that there was any doubt on the issue, the content of the affidavit dispose of the point taken by the respondent.

80What emerges from the Agreed Facts is that the respondent was engaged in the systematic, illegal acquisition of pseudoephedrine for the purpose of supplying it to someone else to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. To that extent, therefore, the respondent was an active participant in a drug supply network. In those circumstances, the low sentence imposed for this offence by reference to the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years cannot be regarded as excessive. This is particularly so in the light of the respondent's poor subjective case.

81This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Respondent's Ground 3: The overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances of the offences, for reasons including:
The sentences for three use false instrument charges were each excessive, and
The delayed commencement of the sentence on 16th January 2012.

82The respondent submitted that the head sentences for the three ""use false instrument"" charges were excessive. He noted that the sentencing judge had consistently referred to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act in relation to those offences, whereas the offences were contrary to s254(b)(i) of the Crimes Act. The respondent submitted that his Honour may well have had a different level of criminality in mind when imposing sentence.

83The respondent submitted that because these offences involved only one packet of medication containing pseudoephedrine for which the purchase price was paid, the level of criminality was low. The respondent submitted that as a result, a non-custodial sentence should have been imposed. Alternatively, the terms of imprisonment should have been no more than one - two months in length.

84In relation to the start date for the sentences, the respondent submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that he had been in custody since 2 December 2010 and that this was a relevant matter when applying the principle of totality. The respondent submitted that it was excessively harsh to totally cumulate the sentences presently under consideration on top of the pre-sentence custody relating to the driving offences.

85The respondent's submission misunderstands why his Honour referred to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. His references to that Act were to explain that the property obtained by the appellant was a prohibited drug, pursuant to that Act. This was relevant because it explained why the appellant had used a false driver's licence to purchase cold and flu tablets. His Honour's references to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act were appropriate and not indicative of error.

86While it is true that the ""use false instrument"" charges related to the purchase of only one packet of medication on each occasion, the submission fails to address the purpose for which the pseudoephedrine was fraudulently obtained, i.e. to manufacture methylamphetamine. Moreover, restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine based products meant that the appellant could not purchase more than one packet at a time.

87These offences were planned and were part of an extended criminal purpose in that they were to be on-sold for the purpose of manufacturing a prohibited drug. The offences were committed over an extended period of time and were motivated by commercial gain. Finally, the sentences imposed for these matters were totally concurrent with the sentences for other matters. Other than their presence on the appellant's criminal record, no additional punishment was exacted for them. 

88In relation to backdating the commencement date for the sentences, this is a matter very much within the discretion of the sentencing judge. His Honour was aware that when the appellant was sentenced for the driving offences, it was known by the sentencing court that he had been in custody since 2 December 2010 and that is why the commencement date for those sentences was backdated to that date.

89Accordingly, his Honour did not err in declining to backdate the commencement of the sentences which he imposed. It would have been of assistance if his Honour had given reasons why he did not do so because such imprisonment can be relevant to totality. Nevertheless, the failure to give reasons on the facts of this case did not amount to error. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Re-sentence

90Because of the errors identified, both in the Crown appeal and in the appeal by the respondent, it will be necessary to re-sentence the respondent.

91The seriousness of the errors identified in the Crown appeal is such that it is inevitable that the sentences to be imposed on the respondent should be increased. That having been said, it will also be necessary to give appropriate effect in that re-sentencing exercise to the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge. The overall effect of the sentences which I propose is a head sentence of 7 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.

92The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Crown appeal allowed.

(2) Leave to appeal is granted to the respondent but the appeal is dismissed.

(3) The sentences imposed by Puckeridge ADCJ on 14 September 2012 are quashed.

(4) In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced as follows:

(i) For the offence of supply a prohibited drug contrary to s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months, commencing 16 July 2011 and expiring 15 July 2012.

(ii) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 7 Harbord Pharmacy) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 October 2011 and expiring 15 October 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year, expiring 15 October 2014.

(iii) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 13 Merrylands) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 January 2012 and expiring 15 January 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 15 January 2015.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL and HOWIE J: We have received the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Adams J. We gratefully adopt his account of the evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    2 The parties conducted the trial on the basis that the jury verdicts would be the same for each count. The trial judge indicated to the jury, in the usual way, that the counts were separate charges and that there was no legal requirement that the jury bring in the same verdict for each count on the indictment. The trial judge, however, did tell the jury that they could take into account their findings in respect of one charge when determining another. Her Honour also told them that there was no logical reason why they would not find the same verdict on the first three counts on the indictment because the Crown’s evidence was the same for those counts. 
     
      
    3 The Judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Because the separate allegations contained in the charges are related, some of the factual findings that you must make based on the evidence will be relevant to a consideration of all of the charges or of some of the individual charges. A finding of fact made in respect of one charge may influence your determination of another charge. Putting count four to one side because it really stands on its own, and I will come to that when I set out the elements to you, but if you found that the accused did not possess the methylamphetamine in the bedroom then that finding can be used by you in considering whether he was knowingly concerned in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine as alleged by the Crown. The converse also applies. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the methylamphetamine in the bedroom then that finding can be used by you in determining whether he knowingly took part in the manufacture of the methylamphetamine, as the Crown alleges, in the shed or the garage. 
         
         
        Looking at it the other way round, if you found that the accused knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine then that finding could be used by you in your consideration of count three. That is looking at what the Crown alleged is that he possessed the precursor, the hypophosphorous acid. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug then similarly that finding could be used by you in your consideration of count three, his asserted possession of the hypophosphorous acid and his intention to use it in manufacture of a prohibited drug 
         
         
        As a matter of practical reality, members of the jury, and this will probably be clearer to you when I take you to the elements or the ingredients of these charges which I'm about to do, you might think that your verdicts on counts 1, 2 and 3, as a matter of common sense and logic, would be the same. Really that is because the Crown relies on essentially the same evidence in respect of all those counts. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count one, that is the charge that the accused knowingly took part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, it is difficult to see how you could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count three. Now that is an expression of opinion by me, you are perfectly entitled to disregard that if you so want, but if you were to find different verdicts in respect of counts one and three for example there would have to be some logical reason for finding different verdicts in respect of those two counts, and as I say when I take you to the evidence and what the Crown has to prove it is essentially the same evidence that the Crown relies on [in] respect of those first three counts. 
        
       
      
    4 At the conclusion of the summing up there was no objection by defence counsel to these directions nor was any further direction or clarification sought. The jury initially raised two questions after their retirement: one about the absence of Ms Pickett, the person found at the house when police went there to search it, and the other about the directions given on possession. There is no issue arising from these questions or the answers given by the Judge. 
     
      
    5 Later in their deliberations the jury asked two further questions. The first is of no significance. The second was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In your Honour's summary there was some possibility to see the first three counts as related and that guilty on one count could lead you to be guilty on other counts. Could you please re-cover the points you made in relation to this?” 
        
       
      
    6 The answer to this question gave rise to some discussion between counsel and the Judge. Defence counsel submitted: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In my submission your Honour should direct them against the notion that guilt in relation to one somehow might assist them in finding guilt in relation to something else. It may well be in a credit case where there is a complainant with a number of counts relating to what the complainant says, that disbelief in relation to one may affect her credibility in relation to others. In this particular's case, a verdict of guilt in one does not and should not be seen as some basis upon which to find or ground guilt in relation to others. In my submission you should disabuse the jury of that notion. It may even be that your Honour might give them a direction that even if they found him guilty in relation to one, it would be impermissible to undertake by a process of tendency reasoning that they - or a process of reasoning that he is guilty of one therefore he is guilty of the others, that would be impermissible, and your Honour should direct them that that would not be an appropriate chain of reasoning, or appropriate course of reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    7 In answering the jury's question, the Judge said (our underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I am sure you are well aware that the first three counts are related because of the circumstances on which the Crown relies. They all deal with a prohibited drug methylamphetamine. It would be impermissible just because you came to a verdict of guilty on one count to reason from that that the accused must be guilty of the other counts involving methylamphetamine. I am completely putting count 4 to one side at the moment because it, as I said, stands on its own in terms of the evidence, and this does not relate in the same way as the first three counts do. 
         
         
        The charges are being heard together because they are related in time and surrounding circumstances. You need to consider each charge separately and independently, and I did say to you before that there is no legal requirement that the verdicts which you are required to give must be the same, although, as you would be well aware, both the Crown and [defence counsel] addressed you on the basis that you would find the same verdict in respect of each of the counts or charges. 
         
         
        Although it is impermissible to reason ""Well we have found the accused guilty of"" - for example - ""a count therefore he must be guilty of all three."" Or putting it the alternative way, ""We have found him not guilty of one count, we won't go any further, we'll find him not guilty of all three."" And I'm dealing with the first three counts. A finding of fact made by you in respect of the one count for example can be used when considering the evidence in another count. 
         
         
        And that's where I think the confusion might have come in, because I think I said to you that is a matter of commonsense and logic, if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count one, it will be difficult to see that you could be satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt of count three, which is the possession of the precursor, because in essence the Crown relies on exactly the same evidence, the same circumstances in respect of all of those three counts. 
         
         
        A finding of fact, if for example you came to the view you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused was guilty of count one, well that finding could be used by you when you are considering whether he was in possession of the precursor which is the subject of count three. And I think I gave other examples before, which I will not repeat at this stage.  
        So it is the findings that you make rather than the verdict that you come to. 
         The other way I think I said before lunch was that if you found that the accused was not in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom, when he would not use that in any way when you were considering whether he was knowingly concerned in the - knowingly took part in the manufacture in count one. 
         
         
        I do not know what order you are dealing with them in, so it is difficult for me to anticipate which way you are dealing with them. But that is in a sort of global sense, that if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom well that could be used by you in consideration of count 1 and vice versa. If you are going through the counts chronologically, that is, in the sequence that the Crown has set them out on the indictment, then if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did knowingly take part in the manufacture, that is a finding that you could use in considering if he were in possession of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom. 
         
         
        The list of circumstances, as I said, I will not repeat, and the alternate list of circumstances pointing the other direction, unless you want me to do so, I do have them in a list here to remind you of those but I'm sure that they are reasonably clear in your minds.” 
        
       
      
    8 Ground two related to these comments by the trial Judge asserting that they were erroneous. It was contended, firstly, that the Judge failed to take into account the ""temporal difference"" between the second and third counts, on the one hand, and the first count, on the other. This was because counts two and three related to the date of the search of the appellant's premises, namely 4 September 2003, whereas count one covered a wide period of time being between 1 January and 4 September 2003. The extended time period in relation to count one arose because the clandestine laboratory situated in the shed could have operated at any time during this eight-month period. 
     
      
    9 In our view the difference in the time alleged in the counts did not mean that the jury could not use findings made on count one in relation to another count or vice versa. A finding that there was in the bedroom of the appellant a large amount of methylamphetamine was not irrelevant to a determination of whether he had permitted his property to be used for the manufacture of that same type of drug in the relatively recent past. As a matter of common sense, it must follow that the fact that a person has a close connection with a large amount of methylamphetamine in premises which he owned and occupied “rationally affected’ the probability that he was involved in the manufacture of such a drug on the same premises: see s 55 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    10 The second basis upon which it is said that these comments were erroneous was because the Crown was not relying upon the fact that the drug found in the bedroom could be linked to the laboratory. It was submitted, therefore, that the only basis upon which the finding in relation to the possession by the appellant of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom could be related to the other two counts relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine was by way of propensity reasoning, that is that it showed that the applicant had some tendency in relation to methylamphetamine. Further, it was argued that the count alleging that the applicant was in possession of the precursor stated that it was for use by the appellant “or another person”. Therefore, so the argument runs, the Crown accepted that the manufacture of methylamphetamine might have been by some other person. 
     
      
    11 We do not accept that, simply because the methylamphetamine in the bedroom was not linked to the shed, it follows that it was irrelevant to the issue of whether the appellant had some involvement in the manufacturing of methylamphetamine in the shed. It is not a case of propensity reasoning. It is merely the recognition that it was improbable that a person who had a large amount of methylamphetamine in his possession, on a property that he owned, was unconnected with the manufacture of that drug on the same property. Similarly the fact that a precursor to the manufacture was found in the shed was relevant to both the issue of whether the appellant was involved in the manufacture and whether he had methylamphetamine in his possession. The Crown alleged that the precursor was for use of the appellant or some other person because it could not show what role the appellant had in the manufacture. However, the relevant facts were that methylamphetamine had been, and could in the future be manufactured in the shed which the appellant owned and could access. 
     
      
    12 Thirdly it was contended that the comments made by the Judge that ""verdicts on counts 1, 2 and 3, as a matter of commonsense and logic would be the same"" did not take into account the different elements of the offences as well as ""the different evidentiary basis"". This asserted error is based upon the fact that, in relation to the count alleging that the appellant was in possession of the drug found in the bedroom, the Crown had to exclude the reasonable possibility that Ms Pickett was in possession of that drug, whereas, in respect of the count alleging that the appellant was in possession of the precursor, no such possibility was raised. 
     
      
    13 The ground of appeal was summarised in written submissions on behalf of the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Accordingly, her Honour's invitation was beset by the danger that the jury would conflate their consideration on the three counts and engage in circular reasoning, rather than consider each charge separately.” 
        
       
      
    14 We do not consider that this ground of appeal has been made out. Her Honour was referring to the relevance of findings of fact made in determining one count to a finding of fact on another count rather than to any verdict given on one count determining the verdict on another count. That is clear from the underlined passages of the answer given to the jury’s question. There was no suggestion of propensity reasoning either expressly or impliedly arising from these comments. 
     
      
    15 The Judge was doing no more than indicating how the case had been presented to the jury by the parties in a practical rather than a technical way. There was no possible basis for suggesting that the jury would “conflate” the three counts. Written directions were given to the jury indicating the elements of each offence and the Judge clearly told the jury what the Crown had to prove before the jury could find the accused guilty on each count. 
     
      
    16 As has been noted, defence counsel took no objection to these directions when they were first given. His objection, when the jury asked the question, was only a concern that the jury might reason that, if the appellant was guilty of one of the three counts, he was guilty of them all. Otherwise he did not indicate that there was anything wrong with the comments the Judge had made and certainly did not suggest that the case was not left on the basis by each of the parties, that logically the verdicts on the first three counts should be the same. As has been noted, the judge cured the possibility that the jury thought she was referring to verdicts rather than findings. Her Honour made it plain that the jury could not reason that a verdict on one count should result automatically in the same verdict for the other two counts. All the Judge was indicating to the jury was that, in the way that the Crown had conducted its case, it was relying upon the same evidence to prove the first three counts and, therefore, the verdicts would probably be the same. 
     
      
    17 The first ground of appeal was that the Judge ought to have directed a verdict of acquittal at the end of the Crown case on counts 2 and 4. The ground was not argued at the hearing of the appeal and counsel for the appellant was content to argue that the verdicts were unreasonable. Clearly that was, with respect, a sensible and practical way to proceed because, if there was no case on any of the counts, the verdict of the jury must have been unreasonable. 
     
      
    18 We are not persuaded that the verdicts were unreasonable. It is not appropriate in our view to look at each of the first three counts in isolation and consider whether the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt on any or all of those counts. That is not how the matter was left to the jury by counsel or the Judge. Clearly the first and third counts were so connected that the verdicts of the jury on those counts had to be the same. The allegation that the appellant was knowingly involved in the manufacture of amphetamine in the shed to whatever degree and the fact that there was the precursor for the manufacture of amphetamine in the shed stood or fell together. The Crown’s case was that the appellant who owned the property and had a key to the shed was in effect in possession of the contents of the shed. As we have already noted, the allegation that he knowingly took part in the manufacture was because the Crown could not say what role he had in it. But it alleged that he at least permitted or suffered the shed to be used for that purpose. 
     
      
    19 The jury were entitled to find, and we would find, that the contents of the shed showed that the laboratory was still capable of being used to manufacture methylamphetamine and there were products for use in that manufacture in addition to the precursor with which the appellant was charged. There was evidence that the laboratory could be put together to make amphetamine in about an hour. 
     
      
    20 In our opinion the jury were entitled to use all of the evidence relating to methylamphetamine or its manufacture as evidence on each of the first three charges. We accept that, had the evidence of the presence of the methylamphetamine in the bedroom been the only evidence, the Crown might have had more difficulty in proving the appellant had possession of it, although we do not accept that the jury could not have found that it was in his possession having regard to all the evidence. The fact that his fingerprints might have been left on the jugs from some other occasion was a matter to be considered, but not in isolation. The location of the amphetamine, the way in which it was stored, the fact that the appellant was the owner and main resident of the premises were facts to be considered together with the presence of his fingerprints. We would not have concluded that there was a real possibility that Ms Pickett was in sole possession of the drug. 
     
      
    21 But the jury was also entitled to take into account all the circumstances surrounding the presence of the drug in the appellant’s bedroom, including what was found in the shed as well as the fact that the appellant was the owner of the premises and had a key to access the shed and a cupboard in the shed. There was also evidence of what he said about the shed and the lies he told about what was inside it. In our opinion the jury were clearly entitled to take into account the presence of the items for the manufacture of methylamphetamine in the shed and his knowledge of the presence of them when considering whether he was in possession of the drug in the bedroom. 
     
      
    22 We are of the opinion that the jury were entitled to find, and we would find, that the appellant was in possession of the amphetamine in the bedroom. 
     
      
    23 Once that finding was made there is little difficulty to our minds in concluding that the appellant was involved with the making of methylamphetamine in the shed. It defies common sense in our view that the appellant could be in possession of a significant amount of methylamphetamine, some of it of high purity, and yet not be involved in the manufacturing of such a drug in the shed on his property. Particularly as the laboratory was operative and, it can be inferred, would have been used in the future given the material found in the shed. 
     
      
    24 We would dismiss the appeal against conviction. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    25 ADAMS J: On 15 June 2005 the applicant was convicted by a jury on all four counts on an indictment in the following terms –  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Between 1 January 2003 and 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        iii. On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have in his possession a precursor, namely an amount of hypo phosphorous acid intended by him for use and the manufacture of a prohibited drug by himself or another person; and 
        
       
       
        
        iv. On 4 September 2003 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] did possess a prohibited weapon, namely a hand held device designed to administer an electric shock, not being authorised to do so by a permit. 
        
       
      
    26 On the day before the trial commenced, the appellant pleaded guilty to one count of possession of .22 calibre firearm, which was a prohibited firearm, not being authorised by a license or permit. 
     
      
    27 The appellant was sentenced on 28 October 2005 to an effective overall sentence of four years and five months with a non-parole period of two years eleven months. The appellant appeals from his convictions; there is no application for leave to appeal in respect of the sentences.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    28 In the early hours of 4 September 2003 the police went to 22 Hughes Avenue Penrith and conducted a search of the premises there. The appellant was found in the bed in a bedroom with a Ms, whose child was in the lounge room. The charges all derive from what was discovered by the police. There was some controversy about where precisely some of the relevant items were located and whether or not some of them were in a locked cupboard in a rear shed on the premises and some uncertainty whether the shed had a third door which may have been locked but these uncertainties – if such they be – do not matter. There was no doubt that the applicant had owned the premises for some years, and, though he occupied them on the date of his arrest, there was no evidence as to how long he had done so: as far as the evidence went, it might have been a matter of years or, perhaps, days. It is clear that he shared the premises on the day of the search with Ms and, very likely with another person who used another bedroom. Whether others had been in occupation of the premises at possibly relevant times is unknown. 
     
      
    29 The shed had plainly been used to manufacture amphetamine. In the shed was found, amongst other things, hypophosphorous acid, a precursor used to manufacture methylamphetamine. In the appellant’s bedroom were found two beakers containing methylamphetamine and, in a drawer, in a bedside table, a stun gun.  
     
      
    30 In my view, the determination of this appeal depends substantially on whether the appellant was in occupation of the premises when methylamphetamine was being manufactured in the shed, or whether, not being in occupation at that time, he knew that the manufacture was taking place and was a party to it in some way, whether the fact that the beakers containing methylamphetamine were found in his bedroom proved (with all the other evidence) that he claimed ownership or control over them sufficient to justify the inference that they were in his possession and whether he was aware if the presence of the stun gun in the bedside table. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
        
       
      
    31 The premises comprised a single storey house with three bedrooms and a driveway leading to the shed at the rear. Police executed a search warrant at about 6am on 4 September 2003. The appellant cooperated fully with police during the execution of the warrant. As I have mentioned, he made no admissions either about the drugs or the stun gun. At the time police entered the premises the appellant was in bed in the main bedroom with Candice Pickett. As the officers went into the lounge room they noticed a small child who had been sleeping on the lounge and who sat up as they came through the door. 
     
      
    32 The shed was fitted with a roller shutter door and a door to the left. There was a door in the back of the shed. A handbag with identification belonging to Candice Pickett, keys to a Holden Commodore and the front door of 22 Hughes Avenue Penrith was found in the house. The door at the side of the shutter was secured with a padlock, a key to which was on a bunch of keys taken by the appellant from a backpack on the floor next to the right hand side of the bed (where he was when police entered the premises). The appellant also gave police a key to a small wooden cabinet inside the shed (called the “office”) to which the shed door gave access. Inside that cabinet was found a five litre plastic container that was holding about a litre of clear liquid. The liquid was not analysed and its nature is unknown. In another unlocked cupboard inside the doorway of the office area police found a backpack which contained the following items: a two litre plastic holding about 1.4 litres of clear liquid containing hypophosphorous acid; two electronic PH testers, the washers on which were found to contain methylamphetamine; a double-necked two litre round bottom reaction flask with traces of brown liquid containing methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine; a saucepan with two handles lined with aluminium foil and having a white solid residue on the base (not analysed); an orange funnel with black electrical tape around the end (not analysed); a glass elbow joint (no prohibited substance detected); a plastic bottle with a white lid and masking tape around the middle labelled H/P acid holding about 100ml of clear liquid which contained hypophosphorous acid; and a plastic container containing a grey granulated substance consistent with being iodine. In the same cupboard was found a one litre glass condenser in which was detected N-formyl-methylamphetamine, which is a by-product of the manufacture of methylamphetamine. On top of a desk in the office area was found a glass baking dish on which was a white powder residue containing pseudoephedrine. In a drawer under the office desk were found packets of Codral day and night tablets, Logicin sinus tablets, Zyrtec tablets, Telfast tablets, Demazin 12 hour tablets, and three documents labelled “cash stock cheque cashing facility” in the name of the appellant. In a cupboard in the office area was found a one litre black plastic drum with three ml of clear liquid in which was detected hydrochloric acid, a 375ml plastic water bottle half full of clear liquid with the words “ACE” and “TONE” written on the bottle, of which a sample was acetone (not a prohibited substance) and a four litre metal tin labelled “acetone full of liquid”. In the shower area were a number of sundry items including a four litre plastic container containing about 200ml of liquid containing ethanol and traces of pseudoephedrine and white sludge containing carbohydrate resembling a tableting agent, a full 500g plastic container of caustic soda. Swabs taken from the tiles on the walls of the shower contained methylamphetamine. Also found under a shelf in the middle of the garage was a twenty litre metal drum containing methylated spirits and another four litre metal tin containing acetone. On the work bench in the garage was found a set of large electronic scales.  
     
      
    33 A chemist from the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory and an expert police officer experienced in the investigation of clandestine laboratories gave evidence that pseudoephedrine could be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and could be extracted from pharmaceutical medications such as those found in the drawer of the desk. The tablets were ground down and mixed with a solvent such as methylated spirits which was then evaporated, thus producing almost pure pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. Residual pseudoephedrine could also be extracted from the solid residue of sludge left at the bottom of the vessel which had not been dissolved by the solvent. The type and variety of tablets found were commonly located in methylamphetamine laboratories. The liquid and white sludge in the plastic container found in the shower area of the shed represented the extraction of pseudoephedrine from pharmaceutical tablets using methylated spirits and, because the concentration of pseudoephedrine was low, the liquid was the second or subsequent extraction of the tableting agent. The pseudoephedrine was reacted with hypophosphorous acid and iodine, producing methylamphetamine. A heating process was necessary, which was typically done in a flask with a condenser attached to the top; a wok which was found in the shower was one of the heating devices sometimes used in order to heat the materials for the reaction. The round bottom reaction flask found in the backpack and the glass condenser in the cupboard inside the office area were almost certainly used for the manufacture of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. After the reaction was completed, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) was added to separate the methylamphetamine in the form of oil from the rest of the mixture by a process of distillation. (It will be recalled that a full 500g container of caustic soda was found in the shower area). The methylamphetamine oil was then usually converted into a salt by being dissolved in acetone and adding hydrochloric acid. As the list of located materials shows, both of these chemicals were discovered in the garage. It is necessary to monitor the acidity of PH level of the mixture. It is obvious that the two testers found in the backpack were used for this purpose. Of course, a number of the chemicals found in the garage, such as acetone could be used for innocent purposes.  
     
      
    34 The shed could fairly be described as a laboratory and there was evidence that the items found in it could be used to manufacture methylamphetamine in less than forty hours. The conclusion that the shed had been used to manufacture methylamphetamine was inevitable. The crucial outstanding question, however, was when it had been so used, as to which there was no evidence. I return to the significance of this issue in due course.  
     
      
    35 In the main bedroom, where the appellant and Ms Pickett were found sleeping, were found a Pyrex 1000ml measuring jug with a metal spoon and brown powder substance weighing 3.4 grams of which 11.1% was methylamphetamine. On this jug was found a print of the appellant’s right middle finger on the bottom and his right thumb on the inside. This jug was on the shelf on the north eastern corner of the bedroom. On the bedside table on the side of the bed on which the appellant was sleeping was found another Pyrex 1000ml measuring jug with a metal spoon, containing an orange brown crystalline powder weighing 17.4 grams of which 73.7% was methylamphetamine. The appellant’s right thumb was identified on the inside of the jug and a print of someone other unknown person was also identified. The evidence of the fingerprint expert was that the fingerprints on the jugs could have been there even before they were washed so that it could not be inferred that, at the time they were evidently handled by the appellant they contained any amphetamine. 
     
      
    36 Twenty-four tablets of Serapax and four tablets of Mogadon, a white powder and small resealable plastic bags were found in a blue cosmetic bag on the floor next to the appellant’s side of the bed. Also found in the bedroom was a set of electric pocket scales.  
     
      
    37 The material discovered in the bedroom, taken together, might have justified a finding that the methylamphetamine contained in the jugs was intended for supply but the Crown case in this respect was that the quantity was such that it was deemed to be possessed for supply. The crucial question was whether the methylamphetamine was in the possession of the appellant. The stun gun was found in a black case in the bottom drawer of the bedside table on the appellant’s side of the bed. It was not disputed that the appellant was not licensed to possess such an item. The gun, operated with a battery, was in working order. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    38 Ground One: There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned trial judge’s failure to direct verdicts of not guilty on Counts 2 and 4;  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that it could use a finding in relation to any Count (other than Count 4) in coming to a conclusion on any other count. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
    39 If the appellant succeeds on Ground 3 it is not necessary to consider either of the other grounds, whilst if he fails on Ground 3, he must a fortiori fail on ground 1. Accordingly, I propose to consider Ground 3 first. 
     
      
    40 Counts 2 and 4 depended upon proof beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of the jugs and the stun gun in the bedroom where he was found when the police entered the premises. The starting point is the link between the appellant and the premises. As I have already mentioned, the applicant was in bed when the premises were entered by police. Following a conversation with police, the appellant obtained from a backpack on the floor near the bed on the side where he had been sleeping keys which, amongst other things, opened the padlock to the door of the garage.  
     
      
    41 The appellant was arrested shortly after a search of the house and cautioned. A little after half an hour later a conversation occurred between the appellant and Constable Rubelj. None of that conversation was elicited by the Prosecutor. However, in cross-examination the following was elicited. He was asked whether the bedroom he was in when the police entered the premises was the main bedroom and he answered, “Yeah”. Constable Rubelj then asked, “This is where you sleep?” and was told, “I sleep and a few other people, yeah”. Constable Rubelj asked, “Who are the other people?” and the appellant replied, “Well I’m not mentioning any names but just other people”. The appellant then identified a toilet bathroom and another bedroom which he said belonged to a Jessie. Just before the appellant was taken by Constable Rubelj to the garage, he was asked, “Alright Steve we’ll just go out the back of the premises and you’ve got a key to the back shed have you?” to which the reply was “Yeah” and the appellant provided a key as already mentioned. As they walked to the back of the workshop area in the shed Constable Rubelj asked, “What is exactly in there” and the appellant replied, “Engine reconditioning, mechanical”. Thus was manifestly untrue. The officer asked, “You do most of your work here or --?” and the appellant replied, “Yeah, when I’m working”. The officer asked, “What are you employed as at the moment?” and received a reply which, however, was not transcribed but contained the word “adjusters”. The officer asked, “Right, and is this just a hobby?” and the appellant replied, “Oh yeah. Basically. It’s what I used to do you know”. Constable Rubelj then asked him, “What is in the back room over there mate?” to which the appellant replied, “Toilet, shower”. He was asked, “Alright. Is that unlocked or--?” and the appellant said, “No, no…open it”. The appellant said of the equipment that it was “a beer brewing kit for brewing home brew”. Again, this was manifestly untrue. There was some other immaterial conversation. 
     
      
    42 The Crown tendered a title search showing the registered proprietor of the property to be the appellant together with a transfer showing that he had acquired the property in February 1996. There was no evidence as to when he was in occupation of the house except, of course, that he was clearly in occupation when police entered the premises. 
     
      
       
      The function of this Court 
      
     43 If I may say so, a useful summary of the relevant considerations applying in this appeal may be found in the decision of this Court in R v Micallef (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 Dunford J (with whom, as to this point, Sully and Bell JJ agreed) said –  
     
      
       
        
        “[39]. In  
        Plomp v The Queen 
         (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243, Dixon CJ repeated what he had said in  
        Martin v Osborne 
         (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person, the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that,  
          according to the common course of human affairs 
          , the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
        
        [40] After referring to the type of matters which cannot be taken into account, such as character, reputations, associations etc., his Honour went on: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘But the class of acts and occurrences which may be considered includes circumstances whose relation to the facts in issue consists in the probability or increased probability,  
          judged rationally upon common experience 
          , that they would not be found unless the fact to be proved also existed.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (Emphasis added.)  
         
          
         
        See also  
        Knight v The Queen 
         (1992) 175 CLR 495; 63 A Crim R 166. 
        
       
       
        
        [41] It is also important to bear in mind that in considering a circumstantial evidence case, it is not the individual circumstances that need to be considered, but the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together; and the jury can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference:  
        Chamberlain v The Queen 
         (No. 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536. 
        
       
       
        
        [42] There is often a tendency in cases of this nature to consider whether each individual circumstance can be separately explained away as being consistent with innocence; or to consider whether a path, however tortuous, can be found through a combination of the circumstances, which as a matter of strict logic, is capable of being reconciled with a conclusion of innocence. The correct test, however, as explained by Dixon CJ in the passages quoted above, is whether, judging the matter rationally in the light of the common experience of human affairs, the combination and totality of the facts proved are consistent with innocence. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] The question for this Court is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; and in answering that question it must not disregard or discount the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence; but if this Court concludes that, even making full allowances for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted, the court is bound to act and set aside the verdict:  
        M v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-494; 76 A Crim R 213 at 216-217.” 
        
       
      
    44 (See also MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606.) 
     
      
    45 In this case, no material question of credibility arose; the jury thus enjoyed no advantage over this Court. However, its status as the primary deciders of guilt or otherwise must not be overlooked. 
     
      
       
      Were the verdicts unreasonable? 
       
      
    46 It is clear that, at the time of the search the appellant and Ms Pickett were in occupation of the house although, of course, at least one other person, Jessie, may have been normally present and, as it happened, not present at the time. It was submitted by the Crown that the presence of the fingerprints on the inside of the jugs is strongly indicative of his control of the contents, in particular of that jug which was located on his side of the bed. In light of the fingerprint evidence, this submission must be viewed with some scepticism. So far as the stun gun was concerned, the Crown relied on the fact it was located in a bedside drawer on the appellant’s side of the bed in a house that he owned and occupied and therefore should be regarded as subject to his control. The crucial question here in my view boils down to whether the evidence justified the conclusion that the appellant knew of the presence of the stun gun.  
     
      
    47 Although the Crown did not argue that the drugs found in the bedroom were the product of the laboratory in the garage, it is relevant to consider, when looking at the question of the possession of the drugs in the bedroom, the fact that the appellant had keys and access to the shed on his premises which had plainly been used for the manufacture of amphetamine. Furthermore, a locked metal cabinet in the office area was opened with a key provided by the appellant; the fact that there is nothing that suggests the connection of the five litre container found in it or the liquid in it with the manufacture of amphetamine does not qualify the inference of control implied by possession of the key. Even so, it is self evident that the mere fact that the appellant had a key could not justify a conclusion that no other person had a key and hence access both to the house and to the garage.  
     
      
    48 In my view, the inference that the appellant, at the least, was aware that the shed was used for the manufacture of amphetamine at one time or another is inevitable and it is reasonable to take this conclusion into account in considering the question of the appellant’s possession of the drugs in the bedroom. The mere presence of those drugs in the jugs in the form they were in strongly suggests a close connection between them and the manufacturing process of which they were the result, even if (as the Crown conceded) it could not be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that that manufacture took place in the garage. Once it is accepted that the appellant was aware that the shed had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine, it is an inevitable conclusion he knew that the matter in the jars was amphetamine. The crucial question, to my mind, is whether there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant was not exercising control over them. The fact that others might have exercised control over them is of course relevant but does not establish that the appellant did not. However, it is not necessary for the defence to establish that he did not exercise any control over the drugs but for the Crown to exclude the reasonable possibility that, although he plainly had access, he also had a sufficient measure of control to amount to possession. 
     
      
    49 In R v Amanatidis (2001) 125 A Crim R 89, Giles JA said (Hulme J not commenting, Adams J agreeing) at 90- 
     
      
       
        
        “[9] 
          
        Possession of a thing in the criminal law involves physical control or custody of the thing plus knowledge that you have it in your control or custody ( 
        He Kaw Teh v The Queen 
         (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 537-539, 546, 585-587, 599-600); 15 A Crim R 203 at 212-214, 219, 248-249, 258-259). The physical control or custody may be shared, but must be control or custody to the exclusion of other persons or persons other than those with whom it is shared ( 
        R v Dib 
         (1991) 52 A Crim R 64 at 66-67). It is not enough, however, that you are one of a number of persons with access to the thing to the exclusion of other persons – that does not constitute your physical control or custody of the thing or physical control or custody shared with the others of the number of persons. So in  
        R v Filipetti 
         (1984) 13 A Crim R 335 finding drugs in the lounge room of a house occupied by six persons, to which all six had access, did not establish physical control or custody of the drugs by one of the occupants, because any physical control or custody of the one occupant was not to the exclusion of the other occupants and shared physical control or custody could not be inferred; see also  
        R v Bazley 
         (unreported, NSWCCA 23 March 1989) and  
        R v Sobolewski 
         (unreported, NSWCCA 21 April 1998). 
        
       
      
    50 Had the drugs been found elsewhere in the house, I would be minded to think that the Crown could not, on the evidence in this case, have excluded the reasonable hypothesis that the applicant merely had access rather than physical control over the drugs. There was no doubt that he was not the only occupant of the premises. In the circumstances here, it seems inescapable that the appellant permitted or, at least, agreed that the drugs could be placed in the bedroom. If that permission or agreement were necessary, the appellant would have had sufficient control at all events to constitute possession in the circumstances. That leaves open the question whether it is reasonably possible that he was simply indifferent to the placing of the drugs in the bedroom and thus exercised no control over them. It seems to me that the facts that the drugs were in his bedroom on clear display, that he must have been aware of their nature, and that by far the larger part was found on the bedside table in his immediate physical proximity demonstrated that he had sufficient knowing physical control of the jugs and their contents to warrant the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was in possession of their contents, even though that control might well have been shared with Ms Pickett. I am not persuaded that a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs, at least at that quantity on the bedside table, was in the appellant’s possession was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    51 Possession of the stun gun, it seems to me, falls into a different category. It was not on clear view. It is not known how long it was in the bedside table nor how it came to be there. It is not known how long the appellant had occupied the premises or, for that matter, how long he had occupied the bedroom. The fact that it was in the bedside table on his side of the bed is certainly strongly suggestive that he knew of its presence. However, it seems to me that the evidence could not justify a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of it. In my view, therefore the verdict in respect of Count 4 is unreasonable. 
     
      
    52 I now move to Count 1 of the indictment. I have already said that it is inescapable to my mind that the appellant was aware that the garage had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine. However, there is no evidence that permits any inference to be drawn as to when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred, nor any evidence as to when the appellant became aware that it occurred. If he was aware only after the event, then he could not be guilty of the offence. If he was aware of the manufacture at the time that it occurred, he is not guilty of the offence unless there is some evidence that he was concerned in the manufacture. It is unnecessary to consider whether, in that event, (say) payment of rent by the occupants undertaking the manufacture would amount to being knowingly concerned in the manufacture since there is simply no evidence that, at that time, the applicant was aware that it was happening. Mere ownership of the premises and knowledge of the manufacture could not be sufficient to establish a knowing concern in the manufacture. If there was evidence that manufacture of the amphetamine occurred at the time of the appellant’s occupation of the premises, then that he was knowingly concerned in it might well be inferred. But there is no evidence justifying this inference. I cannot see how the fact that there were beakers of amphetamine in the appellant’s bedroom can support any inference about when the manufacture of the amphetamine occurred or whether the appellant was aware, at the time of manufacture, that it was occurring. Nor does that the fact that he owned the premises at the time of manufacture shed any light on when the manufacture occurred or when he found out about it. These matters taken together do not fill these gaps in the Crown case. With respect, I do not see how common sense makes the required links. To the contrary, common sense demonstrates that it is not known when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred or whether the appellant was aware of the manufacture at the time it was occurring and, hence, that it is unknown whether he was knowingly concerned in the manufacture of amphetamine.53 It seems to me that the problem for the Crown in this case arises from its inability to prove neither when the appellant was in occupation of the premises nor when the manufacture of amphetamine occurred. This problem is not resolved by the wide range of dates in the indictment. Even if it be accepted that the amphetamine in the jars in the bedroom was very likely to have been manufactured in the shed, it does not follow beyond speculative suspicion that the appellant was in occupation at the time of that manufacture. This is not a matter that depends upon the credibility of any witness. It follows that the verdict of guilty in respect of the first count must be set aside as unreasonable.  
     
      
    54 So far as the third count is concerned, namely the possession of hypophosphorous acid, that was contained in the backpack with a number of other items that had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine and, of course, might well be used again for that purpose. As with the other items, there was no evidence as to when the acid was placed in the bag nor when the bag was placed in the cupboard in the shed nor, for that matter, whether it was placed there by the appellant. There was some inconsistency in the evidence of the police officers as to whether the cupboard in which the backpack was found was locked. The evidence of the officer who located the backpack, although unqualified in chief, was somewhat less clear in cross-examination. To my mind, nothing depends on this point. Certainly the appellant produced a key to the cupboard in which, in the Crown case the backpack was found. In my view, the jury were entitled to conclude that the backpack was indeed in the cupboard and that the appellant had a key to that cupboard which he produced to the police.  
     
      
    55 More difficult for the Crown in respect to this count seems to me to be the necessity to establish, beyond reasonable doubt in the circumstances here, that the appellant was aware of the nature of the substance. I do not think that it was essential that he be aware that it was hypophosphorous acid but I think that it essential that he should be aware that it was a precursor chemical for the manufacture of amphetamine. This follows from the terms s24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which gave rise to the offence. That provision is on the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        24A  
        Possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs 
         
        ( 
        1) A person who has possession of a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence. 
        
       
      
    56 It seems to me that, to make out the offence, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person knew that the substance is a precursor for the (in the circumstances of this case) manufacture or production of amphetamine. It is unnecessary to consider refined arguments concerning the nature of knowledge required for the purposes of establishing possession, given the terms of the section itself. In this case, however, even if the prosecution proved that the appellant was in possession of the bag and was aware that the substance in the container in the bag was a precursor, in my view the evidence could not justify the conclusion that the appellant intended to use the acid for the purposes of manufacturing or producing amphetamine or that he intended that another person should do so. The mere fact, if it be the fact, that some of the acid in the container had been used for the manufacture of amphetamine (which I think might readily be inferred) does not mean that the remaining acid was intended by the appellant to be used for that purpose either by him or by another. Accordingly, the verdict of guilty upon this charge was unreasonable. 
     
      
    57 Having regard to the grounds upon which the convictions on Count 1, Count 3 and Count 4 must be quashed, it seems to me that verdicts of acquittal must be entered with respect to those Counts. 
     
      
       
      Ancillary  
      matters 
       
      
    58 The appellant was sentenced as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        Count 4: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 26 October 2005 and expire on 25 October 2006; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 24 April 2006 and expire on 25 April 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 26 October 2006 and expire on 27 October 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 1: non-parole period of eighteen months imprisonment to date from 26 October 2006 and expire on 25 April 2008 with a total term of three years imprisonment to expire on 25 October 2009. 
        
       
      
    59 The effective overall sentence was therefore a total term of four years and five months with a non-parole period of two years and eleven months. 
     
      
    60 The learned sentencing judge made it clear that she approached the sentencing of the appellant by fixing what her Honour regarded as appropriate sentences for each offence and then adjusting the extent of accumulation having regard to the principle of totality. 
     
      
    61 The sentences on the present indictment commenced on the expiration of the sentence for possession of a prohibited firearm upon which the appellant was convicted before trial and to which I referred at the outset of this judgment. Accordingly, the sentence for count 2, the only remaining count on the indictment for which he was tried must commence on 26 April 2006. The appellant was sentenced on this count to a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months expiring on 25 April 2007. Although the learned judge did not expressly say so, I think that this fixed term was imposed as a reflection of a non-parole period which otherwise would have been imposed had the appellant not been sentenced on count 1 to a non-parole period of eighteen months imprisonment dated from 26 October 2006 and expiring on 25 April 2008 which sentence, apart from the initial six months, wholly included the sentence passed in respect of count 2.  
     
      
    62 It therefore seems necessary to vary the sentence on count 2 by converting the fixed term into a non-parole period but imposing a total term which will provide for a period on parole. This would, of course, be both technically and practically an increase of the sentence passed on count 2. The Court has the power to do so under s7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The learned sentencing judge did not find that there were any relevant special circumstances except those that applied where sentences were being accumulated in order to ensure that the overall sentence reflects the statutory ratio in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I would agree with this finding: there are no other special circumstances that would justify a variation of the statutory ratio. If count 2 were considered by itself, therefore, it appears that the appropriate sentence would be a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 26 April 2006 and expire on 25 April 2007 with a total term of one year and four months. The picture, however, is complicated by the fact that the sentence on count 2 was accumulated upon the sentence, not only for count 4 (now quashed) but also partly on the sentence imposed for possession of the prohibited firearm. However, I would not adjust the commencing dates of the sentences because I regard the effective non-parole period of 1 year and seven months as being the minimum sentence capable of reflecting the appellant’s criminality in respect of these two offences. Nor would I think it appropriate to extend the total sentence imposed for count 2 in order to comply with the statutory ratio.  
     
      
    63 These matters were not the subject of submissions by the parties and, because the effect of my proposed orders would be to increase the penalty on count 2, I think that the Court should first consider any submissions which the parties, in particular the appellant, wishes to make upon this point.  
     
      
    64 Accordingly, I would propose that the convictions in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4 of the indictment be quashed and verdicts of acquittal be entered and the question of sentence be deferred to permit the parties to make written submissions.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      
     1  
     JAMES J: 
      Kimberley Wayne Middlebrook has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on the 29 August 2003 by her Honour Judge English, after he had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996. Section 51D was inserted in the Firearms Act by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002 No 47 which commenced on the 15 July 2002. Section 51D(2) provides:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “A person who is in possession of more than three firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm...is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 
          
           
           (a) the firearm is not registered; and 
            
           (b) the person is not authorised by a licence or permit to possess firearms. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years."" 
         
        
       
      
      
     2 In sentencing the applicant her Honour took into account seven further offences which I will refer to more fully later in this judgment. For the offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act and taking into account the further seven offences, her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years commencing on the 29 August 2003, the date of sentencing, with a non-parole period of three years. 
      
       
      
     3 The applicant had been arrested and charged on the 18 February 2003 but had immediately been granted bail and he had remained at liberty on bail until he was sentenced.  
      
      
     4 Her Honour's statement of the facts of the offence was derived from a statement of facts prepared in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which was admitted into evidence without objection in the proceedings on sentence. In her remarks on sentence her Honour said: 
      
      
       
        
         
         “… on 13 February 2003, after receiving information that the offender had cannabis plants and unregistered firearms at his premises, police sought and obtained a search warrant. At 3.40 pm on 14 February 2003 six officers from the Manning Great Lakes Area Command drove to the offender’s premises and executed the search warrant. The offender resides at 190 Winmurra Drive Possum Brush. The property is a rural block approximately 37 hectares in area. A cabin and a large open work shed stand on the property about 200 metres back from Winmurra Drive at the end of a dirt driveway. The work shed is about 40 metres east of the cabin and a caravan was parked about ten metres east of the work shed. No one was present when the police arrived at the property. A search was conducted and five cannabis plants were located on the eastern side of the caravan. The plants were growing in containers and measured .5 of metre to 1.5 in heights, and the plants were seized.  
         
        
        
         
         Police then drove around the property looking for more cannabis plants. Two hundred metres along the dirt track police located another four cannabis plants growing in pots near a dam located on the property. These plants measured one to two metres in height and they were also seized. Police returned to the cabin and entered it through the front door which was unlocked. Police immediately saw four firearms mounted horizontally on the wall. The firearm at the top was a Bentley pump action 12 gauge shotgun, the weapon was loaded with three shotgun shells. The second firearm from the top was a Greener’s single shot 12 gauge shotgun, this weapon had a shot sitting in the breech. There were no rounds in the breech. The third weapon from the top was a Sterling .22 calibre bolt action rifle with telescopic scope and magazine. The last firearm on the rack was a Slazenger .22 calibre bolt action single shot rifle. There was no round in its breech. A PVC canon, known as a Spud canon was leaning against the wall. Two ammunition belts were hanging on the wall. One belt contained eight .222 calibre rounds, the second belt contained also .222 calibre rounds. A loaded SKK assault rifle magazine was found on a shelf above the firearms rack. A silver foil containing 3 grams of cannabis seeds was located in a drawer in the bar area. The four firearms, the ammunition belts, the SKK magazine and the PVC canon were seized by police. So too were the drugs.”  
         
        
       
      
     5 On 18 February 2002 the applicant voluntarily attended the Forster Police Station, exercised his right to silence and was charged. As I have already stated, he was immediately granted bail.  
      
      
     6 It was the possession of the four firearms mounted on the wall of the cabin which gave rise to the charge under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act. It was not disputed that none of those firearms were registered and that the applicant was not authorised to possess any of them. The Bentley pump action shotgun was a ""prohibited firearm"" within the meaning of that expression in the Act, as falling within schedule 1 of the Act.  
      
       
      
     7 The seven further offences which the sentencing judge took into account in sentencing the applicant were: 
      
       
      
     1. Cultivation of nine cannabis plants. 
      
     2. Possession of three grams of cannabis seeds. 
      
     3. Unauthorised possession of the PVC Spud cannon. 
      
     4. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the PVC Spud cannon. 
      
     5. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the firearms, being the Greener shotgun, the Sterling rifle and the Slazenger rifle. 
      
     6. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the prohibited weapon, being the Bentley pump action shotgun. 
      
     7. Unauthorised possession of ammunition, being the SKS assault rifle ammunition. 
      
       
      
     8 The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour summarised some of this evidence in her remarks on sentence. Her Honour did not expressly say that she accepted this evidence. However, the evidence had not been challenged in cross-examination of the applicant or in the submissions made on behalf of the Crown in the proceedings on sentence and, in the absence of any statement by her Honour that she did not accept the evidence or any apparent reason why she should not accept the evidence, I would infer that her Honour accepted it. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The firearms he says he has owned for a number of years. He was unaware that the Bentley shot gun was a prohibited weapon. He knew he was required to be licensed to own firearms, he just did not bother to obtain a licence. He was aware of the police amnesty and the buy back for the purpose of reducing the number of firearms in the community. He handed in the SKK assault rifle, but chose to keep the remainder of the firearms. He says he kept the firearms to destroy wild dogs, foxes and other vermin on his property. He says they were kept with ammunition in the magazines, not in the breeches, so that he did not have to look for ammunition if he needed to use the rifle in the event that dogs or dingoes were harassing his cattle. He denies that he had the guns loaded to protect his cannabis plants. He says that the PVC cannon was given to his son at Christmas, he was concerned about his son having possession of such a object, so he insisted it remain at Rainbow Flat, rather than be taken back to Brisbane when his son returned after the Christmas holidays.”  
         
        
       
      
     9 In his evidence the applicant said that he had had the Bentley pump action shotgun for about 25 years, that he had used it for duck shooting and that he had last fired it about nine or twelve months before, to shoot a brown snake.  
      
      
     10 The applicant gave evidence that he had had the Greener shotgun and the Slazenger rifle since his wife's father had given them to him about eight years before he was sentenced. The applicant gave evidence that he had had the Sterling rifle for about 15 years, after he had exchanged a trailer for it.  
      
      
     11 In assessing the objective gravity of the principal offence her Honour referred in her remarks on sentence to a number of matters. Her Honour noted that in July 2000 laws had been introduced to inhibit the illegal supply of firearms (her Honour would have been referring to the Firearms Amendment (Trafficking) Act 2001 No 24) and that these laws had been amended by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002 No 47. Her Honour referred to part of the speech by the Minister for Police on the second reading of the Bill which became the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act in which the Minister (Mr Costa) had said:  
      
       
        
         
         “This will mean that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market will be liable for up to 20 years in gaol if the firearm is prohibited.” 
         
        
       
      
     12 Her Honour said in her remarks on sentence that the use of firearms to commit robberies, to injure and murder police and members of the public and to commit other crimes is becoming prevalent. Her Honour immediately added:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “I am not suggesting for one moment that it was the intention of this offender to do any of those things, but to keep these weapons and to keep them in such a way that access was easily gained to his cabin where they were kept, allows anyone wishing to obtain a firearm to commit a serious offence, instant access to a veritable arsenal capable of causing great harm.” 
         
        
       
      
     13 Later in her remarks on sentence her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “However, having regard to the objectively serious nature of the offence committed and the objectively serious nature of the offences contained on the Form One and the intent of the legislation, I find that this is a matter of the utmost gravity and would result in the imposition of a prison sentence. I find that the offender has shown a blatant disregard for the criminal law. The offender had little regard for public safety. The firearms were on display, they were with magazines loaded and they were kept in premises that were unlocked and easily accessible. The police simply walked onto the property and into the buildings. On the owner’s own evidence, his 15 year old son had access to the weapons which were mounted on the wall and ready for use.”  
         
        
       
      
     14 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said that ""as this offence was committed after 1 January 2003, the applicant is to be sentenced under the new regime,"" by which her Honour meant that the applicant was to be sentenced under legislation which included Div 1A of Pt 4 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      dealing with standard non-parole periods. In fact Div 1A of Pt 4 applies only to offences committed after the 1 February 2003, but as the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was committed on the 13 February 2003, Div 1A of Pt 4 would have been part of the legislation in force.  
      
      
     15 Her Honour acknowledged that an offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act was not included in the offences for which a standard non-parole period had been set. However, her Honour noted that a standard non-parole period had been set for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act. Under s 7 of the Firearms Act it is an offence to possess or use a firearm without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 7 is imprisonment for 14 years if the firearm concerned is a prohibited firearm. The standard non-parole period which has been set for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act is three years.  
      
      
     16 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said that the five firearms offences which were to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the principal offence called for an increase in the penalties to be imposed for the principal offence.  
      
      
     17 Her Honour also considered the two drug offences to be taken into account required the imposition of an increased penalty for the principal offence, ""they too being matters of an objectively serious nature.""  
      
       
      
     18 In a part of her remarks on sentence her Honour summarised some of the subjective features of the applicant as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “This offender is presently aged 45. He left school at the end of fourth form in 1974, as it then was, and he took up an apprenticeship and obtained trade qualifications as a mechanic. He married and subsequently separated. He has two sons who live with their mother in Brisbane, but he continues to support them financially and remains in touch with them. In 1990 he moved to Rainbow Flat where he purchased the rural property where he now resides. He has lived there ever since doing some part time mechanical work when it becomes available, otherwise, he is in receipt of unemployment benefits.”  
         
        
       
      
     19 Later in her remarks on sentence her Honour observed that the applicant had a criminal record but that it was of no consequence. The applicant's criminal history consisted of a conviction in 1976 for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood and a charge of malicious damage in 1993 which had been dismissed under s 556A of the Crimes Act, as then in force.  
      
      
     20 A number of character witnesses gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence, who (as her Honour said in her remarks on sentence) testified that the applicant was a law-abiding citizen and an upstanding member of the community.  
      
      
     21 In this application the following grounds of appeal were raised: 
      
       
        
       1. The sentencing judge had erred in her assessment of the objective gravity of the principal offence. 
        
       2. The sentencing judge had erred in her assessment of the objective criminality of the offences to be taken into account. 
        
       3. The sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the applicant's very favourable subjective circumstances. 
        
       4. The sentencing judge had erred in having regard to the existence of a standard non-parole period for an offence other than the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. 
        
       5. The sentencing judge had erred in finding that non-custodial sentencing options were not available. 
        
       6. The sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive. 
        
       7. The sentencing judge had failed to consider whether special circumstances existed within  
        
       s 44(2) of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
       
      
      
     22 As to the first ground, it was submitted that her Honour had grossly overstated the criminality in the principal offence; and that the fact that the offence under s 51D(2) had been created, according to the Minister's second reading speech, so that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market would be liable to severe punishment did not mean that anyone whose conduct fell within the terms of the section should be severely punished. Her Honour's finding that the applicant's 15 year old son had access to the firearms was criticised on the basis that on the evidence the applicant's son lived most of the time with his mother in Brisbane.  
      
       
      
     23 As to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted that the criminality involved in the offences of failing to ensure the safekeeping of the prohibited firearm and the other firearms had already been taken into account by the sentencing judge in assessing the objective criminality of the principal offence, so that no further penalty would have been warranted by reason of taking those further offences into account; that the other firearm offences to be taken into account were minor; and that the two drug offences of cultivating as few as nine cannabis plants, which the applicant had testified were to be for his own use, and having in his possession as small a quantity as three grams of cannabis seeds, so far from being objectively serious, as her Honour considered, were very minor offences.  
      
      
     24 As to the third ground of appeal, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the virtual absence of any criminal history, the character evidence given in the proceedings on sentence, the very positive pre-sentence report in which the author of the report had said that the Probation and Parole Service had ""no concerns regarding drug or alcohol issues"", her Honour's view that ""it is not a matter where rehabilitation looms large"", that is, her Honour considered there was little risk of the applicant reoffending, and her Honour's finding that the applicant was remorseful.  
      
      
     25 As to the sixth ground, it was submitted that, as a consequence of what had been submitted in support of the first three grounds, the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive.  
      
      
     26 I propose to deal now with the grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6. In my opinion all of grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6 should be upheld.  
      
       
      
     27 The applicant's conduct in having in his possession more than three firearms, one of which was a prohibited firearm, without the firearms being registered or the applicant being licensed to possess them, did fall within s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act and required that some penalty be imposed on the applicant. However, I accept the contention by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge overstated, and seriously overstated, the objective gravity of the principal offence.  
      
      
     28 According to the Minister's second reading speech, the purpose of s 51D was ""to crack down on possession (of firearms) for the purposes of illegal trafficking"" and, as previously stated in this judgment, to ensure that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market would be liable to severe punishment. 
      
      
     29 In the present case, there was nothing to suggest that the applicant was in possession of the firearms for the purposes of trafficking in them. The applicant had acquired all of the firearms many years before in legitimate transactions and there was nothing to suggest that he intended to dispose of any of them. The sentencing judge herself was at pains to disclaim any suggestion that she thought that the applicant himself might use any of the firearms to commit a crime. The applicant had been in possession of the prohibited firearm, that is the Bentley pump action shotgun, for 25 years. He had used it for shooting ducks and had last used it 9-12 months before to shoot a snake. The firearms were kept by the applicant at a fairly remote country property about 15 kilometres from Taree, where the applicant lived alone, and, although the firearms were kept mounted on a wall in a cabin on the property instead of being locked away, I consider that her Honour overstated the risk of ""anyone wishing to obtain a firearm to commit a serious crime (having) instant access to the applicant's firearms."" I accept that the applicant's 15 year old son lived most of the time with his mother in Brisbane.  
      
       
      
     30 For the reasons advanced by counsel for the applicant, I consider that her Honour erred in considering that the offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the principal offence required the imposition of a significantly increased penalty for the principal offence. The failures to keep the firearms safe so that there was a risk of wrongdoers having access to them had already been taken into account by the sentencing judge as a circumstance of aggravation in assessing the objective criminality of the principal offence. The two drug offences, so far from being objectively serious, were, in my opinion, quite minor.  
      
       
      
     31 I accept that the applicant had very favourable subjective circumstances.  
      
       
      
     32 Having regard to what I consider to be a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the principal offence and of the extent to which the sentence for the principal offence could properly have been increased by reason of the offences to be taken into account and to the applicant's subjective circumstances, I consider that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive, that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and that the appeal against sentence should be allowed.  
      
      
     33 In the light of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the fifth and seventh grounds of appeal. It is also unnecessary to consider the fourth ground of appeal, which raises a question which I consider a two judge Bench of this Court should not endeavour to resolve. It is clear that Div 1A of Pt 4 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      has no direct application, in that an offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act is not included in the table of offences to Div 1A.  
      
      
     34 Having decided that the appeal should be allowed it is necessary for me to consider what sentence should be imposed in the re-sentencing of the applicant. There is no need for me to repeat the objective facts of the principal offence or of the offences to be taken into account or the subjective features of the applicant. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account the relevant provisions of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) 
       
     Act 
     .  
      
      
     35 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, if the appeal was allowed and a lesser sentence was imposed, the Court should order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention or that the sentence should be suspended. It was also submitted that the Court should at least find that there were special circumstances.  
      
      
     36 I consider that the Court should find special circumstances. It is a sufficient ground for a finding of special circumstances that the applicant has never previously been to prison.  
      
      
     37 I have already stated my conclusion that the sentencing judge seriously over-estimated the objective gravity of the principal offence. However, the Legislature has made it clear that the possession of more than three firearms, if the firearms are not registered and the possessor is not authorised to possess them, is a serious offence and is an even more serious offence, if one of the firearms is a prohibited firearm. Although I consider that the sentencing judge over-estimated the likelihood of other persons having access to the applicant's firearms, there was a potential for such firearms to fall into wrong hands and to be used in the commission of crimes.  
      
      
     38 In my opinion, a custodial sentence should be imposed and I do not consider that the Court should order that it be served by way of periodic detention or that any part of the sentence should be suspended.  
      
       
      
     39 In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted. The appeal should be allowed. The sentence imposed by her Honour, Judge English on the 29 August 2003 should be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence should be imposed: I consider that a non-parole period of one year should be set commencing on the 29 August 2003 and expiring on the 28 August 2004. I consider that the balance of the term of imprisonment should be a further period of one year. The applicant will be entitled to be released from custody on the expiration of the non-parole period on the 28 August 2004. The date on which the total sentence will expire will be the 28 August 2005.

12715,2768147,R v Fletcher (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1692,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	The Crown has sought to cross-examine the witness Andrea Parker (I have used a pseudonym due to her age to comply with s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)) about a prior inconsistent statement that she is said to have made to a Kay Lorraine Henson. That prior inconsistent statement is recounted at paragraph 20 of Ms Henson’s statement of 3 September 2014, which was tendered some days ago on the voir dire, and became Crown voir dire exhibit E.
	
	
	The application is made pursuant to s 38(1)(c) of Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Suffice to say, it is proposed to cross-examine Ms Parker about what it is Ms Henson says Ms Parker said to her very shortly after the alleged offence.
	
	
	With the assistance of both counsel, I have looked to the mandatory matters that I must consider in ss 38(6) and 192 of the Evidence Act. The transcript will show my analysis of those. But, to repeat it very briefly, defence counsel has been on notice for some weeks that this application is on foot: s 38(6)(a). Separately, it is clear that defence counsel, who will cross-examine after the Crown concludes her cross-examination pursuant to s 38, will inevitably be asking questions about this very topic: s 38(6)(b).
	
	
	Separately, turning to s 192, I think that there is a potential for this questioning to add to the length of the proceedings, but by no means unduly: s 192(2)(a).
	
	
	To my mind, permitting the Crown to explore with Ms Parker what she is alleged to have said to Ms Henson does not occasion any unfairness to the accused or the witness: s 192(2)(b).
	
	
	I think that the evidence is important, in that it is the Crown case that it was at that very time under discussion– namely, when Ms Parker and her father, the accused, visited the deceased and Mr Cavanough - that the act causing death occurred: s 192(2)(c).
	
	
	The proceedings are a trial for the most serious offence known to law: s 192(2)(d).
	
	
	Finally, there is no alternative way forward (in terms of logistical steps or directions) other than, to my mind, cross-examination: s 192(2)(e).
	
	
	Ultimately, Mr Ainsworth for the accused did not seek to oppose vigorously this particular application, whilst reserving his right with regard to other applications, and also seeking to have, as soon as reasonably practicable, notice of all applications of this nature that the Crown might be making.
	
	
	I think it is appropriate that this limited application pursuant to s 38 be granted now. The Crown has foreshadowed others but, to my mind, the questioning with regard to this topic could possibly inform the determination with regard to other topics. The parties, I understand, are content to adopt my suggested process of conducting the cross-examination pursuant to these applications seriatim.
	
	
	For the time being then, I grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Ms Parker about whether she has at any time made a prior inconsistent statement, namely to Ms Kay Henson as recounted in paragraph 20 of voir dire exhibit E.

This is an action for damages made under ss 8 and 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) in relation to the death of one Lim Kim Tong (LKT) following an accident on 19 December 1981 at a construction site which was, at the material time, occupied by the second defendants. The claim against the first defendants (who were the owners of the site) was, by consent, discontinued at the conclusion of the hearing of this action.
The second defendants were building contractors who were constructing a 25-storey block of flats (the building) for the first defendants. The site of the building was bounded on one side by a large canal, viz the Alexandra Canal and on the opposite side by Ganges Road, and on one side by a school, viz the Delta West School, which was fenced off from the site, although there was a gate leading into the site, and on the opposite site by another road, viz Delta Road.
On the date of the accident, the second defendants had already completed the entire structure of the building and were in the course of hacking the uneven walls in preparation for plastering them. During the construction of the building a safety net had been strung across the walls to catch any falling stones and debris. A gondola was used to hack the 25 floors of the building. It was hanging beside the wall on the 14th level at the time of the accident. Also, during construction, the public was prevented from having access to the works by a wooden fence or hoarding. Both the safety net and the fence was also taken down after the completion of the structure.
There was located on the ground floor of the building at the material time a coffee stall. This stall was operated by a licensee of the second defendants from the beginning of the construction works to cater to the needs of the workers. There is a conflict of evidence as to whether members of the public were disallowed from buying drinks and food from this stall. The plaintiffs have produced three witnesses who testified that members of the public had full access to the stall and frequented the stall as it was the only coffee stall within the surrounding area. The second defendants` witness, the supervisor, said that the stallholder was allowed to sell drinks and/or food to the workers and no one else. Having heard the witnesses, I believe the evidence of PW1 and PW2 and find that there was no restriction whatever against the stallholder selling drinks and food to any person who patronized it. The coffee stall was accessible to members of the public. There was no conceivable reason for them to do so since the second defendants claimed that they had put up adequate fencing/hoarding to prevent members of the public from going into the construction site. In any case, the important point was whether at the material time, the site and the coffee stall were accessible to the public. In my view, the evidence clearly establishes that both were accessible to the public.
The question is whether the second defendants were negligent as regards LKT, who was a member of the public. LKT was then living at Block 79, Indus Road which was situated next to the building site. He was then 18 years old. His friend, Lim Hang Huat (PW2), testified that on the afternoon of 19 December 1981 at about 1pm, he and LKT went to a nearby kampong to catch spiders. It began to rain about half an hour later. They wanted to look for shelter in the building as well as have a cup of coffee. They ran to the building, went under it on the ground floor on one side of it and continued to run towards the coffee stall. To reach the coffee stall by the most direct route, they have to cross an open space between two sections of the building. As they were crossing this space, LKT who was running ahead, was struck by something falling from above. PW2 heard the sound of a stone or a lump of cement. LKT fell on the ground. Something also fell on PW2`s thigh but he was not injured. LKT began to bleed and appeared unconscious. PW2 dragged him into the covered section of the building. The Indian stallholder and some workers came to look. PW2 ran to inform PW1, the father of LKT.
PW1 testified that upon being informed of the accident, he ran to the site. He found LKT lying on the ground and bleeding. It was raining heavily. He carried his son to the side. LKT was conscious and `struggling` and shouting that someone threw a stone at him. Later the ambulance arrived and took him to hospital. He fell into a coma in hospital and died on 25 December 1981.
The post-mortem report on LKT disclosed that he died from a fracture of the skull. His skull had `a large burr hole at right parietal bone 8 x 7 cm. There was a fracture of the right temporal bone 8cm with extradural haemorrhage.` The coroner found and I agree with him that the injury was caused by a hard object falling on the head of LKT.
I also find as a fact from the evidence adduced by the defence witness that the hard object was probably a stone or a lump of hardened cement which had fallen from the side of a wall or the gondola which was hanging in the air next to the wall. The profile of a `burr hole` in the skull would suggest, most likely, a piece of hardened cement. Whatever it was, it either came off the wall or fell from the gondola. I have already mentioned that at this time the defendants were hacking the uneven walls of the building, and it may therefore be inferred that the falling object was a lump of uneven hardened cement.
The next issue of fact on which I make a finding is that on the evidence adduced before me there was insufficient reason for the second defendants` workers to remove the safety net in order to do the hacking work. DW2, the site foreman, testified that the net was removed because it impeded access to the gondola. I cannot agree. He was unable to explain why the net could not have been strung up in a way which allowed access to and from the gondola. In fact, he said that the safety net was taken off because it was their practice to do so. If the netting had not been taken off, this particular tragedy would not have happened. I think that the workers failed to appreciate the hacking work would pose a risk of injury to members of the public by falling lumps of cement.
It was also a fact in issue whether the defendants had placed warning signboards on the building to warn the public to keep out of the site. The plaintiffs called two witnesses to testify on this issue. One of them (PW4), the brother-in-law of the deceased, who was also living in Block 79, testified that he went to the scene of the accident at about 2pm to take a look. He saw a pool of blood at the spot where LKT had fallen. He did not see the signboard (as shown in P9 which photograph was taken sometime after the accident. Since it was taken by the police in daylight, it could only have been taken on the following day at the earliest). After that he went home, and shortly after that he saw a red car stopping near the place of the accident and three or four men taking out signboards from the boot of the car. The men then nailed the signboards to the building. He, of course, would not see P9 being marked to the building. He also said that he informed his wife, who was LKT`s sister, and also other members of LKT`s family what he had seen the following day.
The second witness was PW3, a reporter with the 
 Sin Chew Jit Poh. 
He testified that he received a telephone call from PW1 on the day of the accident. He and his photographer went to LKT`s house but were told that PW1 was at the hospital. They went to the hospital and met PW1 who told them about the condition of LKT and the nailing of the signboards after the accident. On the following day, he went to the site with PW1 who repeated his allegation concerning the signboards. PW3 and his photographer took a look at P9. He observed that the nails were new and not rusty. He and the photographer agreed with PW1`s allegation about the signboards having been put up very recently. They then wrote a report about the accident which was published in the newspaper the following day.
The defendants called three witnesses to testify on this issue. The first, DW1, was a sergeant then attached to the Tanglin Police Station. He was informed about the accident at about 5.05pm but he did not visit the scene until about 7pm-7.30pm when it was already dark. [In his evidence at the coroner`s inquiry, he said he arrived at the scene at about 7.40pm]. He said he saw P9 and another signboard. However, this other signboard was not shown in any of the photographs tendered in court. In my view, DW1`s evidence was wholly inadequate and was insufficient to prove that P9 had been there before the accident.
The second witness for the defence was DW2. His evidence was that there were signboards on all sides of the building prior to the accident. He said that they were put up after the completion of the ground level of the building, and that the signboards were in three languages.
The third witness, DW4, was a former safety officer employed by the HDB whose job was to inspect all the sites where the HDB had buildings under construction. He was in charge of more than 100 sites. He said he saw warning signboards on the building when he visited the site about two months before the accident. However, he could not mark them correctly at the locations he said he had seen them. In my view, the evidence of DW4 was also of no assistance to the defendants.
The only independent witness in relation to P9 was PW3. He was a reporter who had been informed of the accident and he went there to investigate. I accept his evidence that when he looked at P9 he found that the nails were new and not rusty. Since DW2`s evidence was that P9 had been there since the completion of the first storey, it was impossible for the nails not to have been rusty. Accordingly, I find that P9 was put up immediately after the accident before the arrival of PW3.
To summarize my findings of fact: at the material time, (a) the building was not fenced off; (b) it was accessible to the public; (c) the coffee stall next to it was also accessible to the public, members of which patronized it; (d) hacking work was going on; (e) there was no safety net to prevent falling debris from injuring any person who happened to be at that spot; (f) a gondola was left hanging in the air between the walls; and (g) there was no signboard warning people not to go to the site or walk through the building. The question is whether the defendants were negligent in these circumstances.
The submission of counsel for the defendants was that the defendants owed no duty of care to LKT as he was a trespasser who had also been warned by signboards of the dangers of entering the site. He also submitted that even if there were no signboards, LKT, by reason of his age, ought to have known of the dangers and therefore the duty of care owed to him was an attenuated duty. Counsel relied on the House of Lords decision in 
 British Railways Board v Herrington 
[1972] AC 877
 as laying down the principle that an occupier only owed a `duty of ordinary humanity`, which was `at once more demanding than a duty merely to avoid reckless or intentional injury [which was the law before 
 Herrington 
 `s case], but less demanding than a duty to take reasonable care.` See 
 Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 
 (15th Ed) at para 12-52 [635].
Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the decision of the Federal Court in 
 Lembaga Letrik Negara v Ramakrishnan 
 
 
 [1982] 2 MLJ 182 
 where it was decided, following 
 Herrington 
`s case and 
 Southern Portland Cement Ltd v Cooper 
[1974] AC 623
 that `the duty owed to trespassers arises when the occupier knows of facts which show a substantial chance that they may come to a place where there is danger which he has created or knows about, and that the duty is discharged by the occupier taking such steps to avoid it in acwith the dictates of common humanity and in the light of his own circumstances and financial limitations`.
In my view, the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs shows that at the material time members of the public had full and unrestricted access to the site to patronize the coffee stall, which was run by a licensee of the defendants. There was no evidence whatever, apart from a mere assertion, that the stallholder was not allowed to sell food and/or drinks to people other than the workers. There was then no fence around the site, and people were allowed to come and go. On this evidence, I do not think that LKT and PW2 were trespassers. They sought shelter at the site when it was raining and they did so because they also wanted to have a drink. Since Block 79, which was where he lived, was just behind the building, LKT could have run home or sought shelter in some other buildings nearby. There was evidence that there was no other coffee-stall in the vicinity. I find that LKT and PW2 were licensees in the sense that they were free to patronize the coffee stall. In any case, even if they were trespassers, the defendants ought to have foreseen such trespassers coming to the coffee stall to patronize it: see 
 Clerk and Lindsell 
 at para 12-55 [640] where the principle is stated, which I accept, that: `[T]he occupier ought in principle to be liable to a trespasser who is injured by the occupier`s breach of duty towards his lawful visitors, if there are any; but, as a substantive rule of law - a qualification upon 
 Herrington 
`s case - an occupier ought not to be so liable to an adult who tresknowingly and without any reasonable excuse for doing so.` In the present case, LKT did not know of the danger and he had a reasonable excuse to come into the site.
Stones and debris falling from the high floors of building sites are common occurrences. This is particularly so when the work involved is hacking of the walls. Bits of the hacked wall are likely to fall onto the gondola or down to the ground. I think that the works created a danger and there ought to have been a safety net at the second level to catch falling debris. There was such a safety net but, it was reasoned by the second defendants` workers for the wrong reason. I think that they followed past practice and could not be bothered to exert the extra effort to put up the safety net in a manner which did not impede the operation of the gondola. The defendants, for no good reason, removed the safety net, and his reason for doing so was that it was their practice to do so.
On the evidence before me, I find that the second defendants owed a duty of care to all those who came to the site to patronize the coffee stall, that they accordingly owed a duty of care to LKT, that they breached their duty of care in not putting up a safety net where and when their employees were hacking the walls of the building. The works created a danger and LKT was a foreseeable victim. Accordingly, I find for the plaintiffs on the question of liability. There was no question of contributory negligence on the part of LKT.
I now assess damages. LKT`s employer, PW6, at the material time testified that LKT was assisting him at his hawker stall selling turtle soup. LKT was paid $15 per day with $4 allowance for meals. As PW6 was also a wholesaler of turtles which were imported from Indonesia, he would also send LKT to the airport twice a week to take delivery, for which LKT was paid $20 per trip. LKT worked six days a week. On this basis, LKT`s annual earnings would be $19 per day x (365-52) = $5,947 + $2,080 ($40 x 52) = $8,027 per year. PW6 did not say that LKT was paid any CPF. PW6 also said that some of his assistants had opened their own stalls selling turtle soup and that he himself was earning net about $3,000 to $5,000 per month selling turtle soup.
The defendants called an investigator, DW3, to investigate the earnings of LKT. He said that he visited PW6`s stall twice, but managed to meet a man who said that he was the boss of LKT and that LKT was being paid $8 per day. I am not able to admit this evidence as PW6 was not cross-examined on this point nor was DW3 asked to testify PW6. Without identification, this evidence was hearsay.
The plaintiffs also called LKT`s mother as a witness and she testified that LKT was giving her about $300 per month.
Special damages have been agreed at $3,457. I award $7,000 for loss of expectation of life and $1,500 for pain and suffering during the short period LKT was conscious.
This is a claim for lost years. I find it impossible to assess the prospective earnings of LKT. He was 18 years old when he died. He left school at primary five. He was then a hawker assistant, earning very good wages, compared with his two previous jobs. But his job was precarious. Counsel for the plaintiffs has suggested that I should assess his maximum earning during his lifetime, had he lived, at $4,000 since PW6 was earning $3,000 to $4,000 per month on the basis that he might have become a turtle soup seller and earning that amount. I find no basis for making an assumption that LKT might have become a turtle soup seller or that he might have earned between $3,000-$4,000 net per month. He might have gone through life as a hawker assistant or as an unskilled worker. Accordingly, I will assess his earnings as at about $8,500 pa. As for the available surplus, I would find that it would be in the region of 40%, having regard to the fact that he was giving his mother $330 per month. The multiplier is agreed at 15.
On this basis, the damages for lost years would be $8,500 x 15 x 40% = $51,000. The total damages are $51,000 + $3,457 + $7,000 + $1,500 = $61,415. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $61,415, with interest at the rate of 6% pa from the date of the writ to the date of judgment and costs to be taxed.
 Order accordingly.",1990-12-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.

Criminal law—Evidence—Verdict.

[Page 167]

Evidence making a prima facie case for the Crown in a
criminal prosecution, if unanswered and believed by the jury, is sufficient to
support a conviction of the person accused.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta
affirming the conviction of the appellant, at the trial, upon an indictment for
arson, on an appeal by special leave upon questions of law in respect of which
the trial judge, Stuart J., refused to reserve a case for the opinion of the
court in banco.

The following statement was made by the learned trial judge in
refusing the application for a reserved case by counsel for the appellant.

STUART J. — ""I refuse to reserve the following
questions for the opinion of the court, en banc, at the next sittings of
the said court to be holden at Calgary, in Alberta.

""(I.) Does the evidence merely point to a suspicion of guilt
instead of being the legal evidence necessary to support a conviction?

""(II.) Was I right in refusing to dismiss the

[Page 168]

charge against the accused at the close of the case for the Crown
upon application made by counsel for the accused ?

""(III.) Was the evidence of the witnesses McMinn and
Mcintosh as to the removal of certain horses alleged to be the property of
Samuel Wilson pursuant to an alleged arrangement with the said Wilson, properly
admitted by me, there being no evidence that the accused had any knowledge of
any horses being on the premises, of their removal, or of any such arrangement,
and objection being taken by counsel for the accused?

""(IV.) Was that portion of my charge to the jury being 'a
person who tells an untruth when not under oath is not a person who is likely
to be believed even when they are under oath' improper?

""(V.) Was that portion of my charge to the jury proper
being, 'people do peculiar things and yet is it a probable thing that she would
do — to leave a bundle of papers there in that store in a drawer which was
apparently unlocked for so long containing incriminating evidence against her
husband of his relations with another woman,' there being no evidence whatever
of the said papers containing any incriminating evidence?

""(VI.) Was I right in refusing to allow counsel for the
accused to have the said papers handed in to the jury while deliberating upon
their verdict unless so requested by the jury?""

A. A. McGillivray for the appellant.

Wallace Nesbitt K.C. and Christopher C. Robinson
for the respondent.

[Page 169]

The judgment of the court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE. — I have always understood the rule to
be that the Crown, in a criminal case, is not required to do more than produce
evidence which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima
facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict. A
careful perusal of the evidence here satisfies me that there is evidence quite
sufficient to prove that the house was destroyed by a fire under circumstances
which clearly pointed to incendiarism, and that the accused might fairly be
presumed to have set the fire. When the Crown's case was closed, of the three
persons who had means of access to the building on the night of the fire two
had given their evidence, frankly and fully testifying to all that occurred;
the third, the accused, volunteered to go into the witness box and attempted to
explain away those things which were calculated to throw suspicion upon her. To
say the least, her explanation is not satisfactory. Her denials of facts that
are proved beyond all doubt are very much to her discredit. In any event, the
jury having had occasion to hear the story of the three persons who alone
admittedly might have caused the fire, and the theory of accident being
eliminated, came to the conclusion, on evidence which, in my opinion, was
sufficient, that the appellant was guilty of the offence with which she was
charged and no reason has been given here to justify us in setting that verdict
aside. The facts are so fully and clearly discussed in the judgments below that
I do not feel it necessary to say more.

      70012/01 Regina v CVH 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    1 On 25 February 2002 CVH (the prisoner) was convicted by a jury of the manslaughter of Tremain Watene, assault on GF, and affray, all of which offences occurred at Campsie on 10 November 1997 at Lahood’s Amusement and Snooker Centre (Lahood’s). His offences were committed in concert with MTN and others and formed part of a joint attack on each of the victims. 
     
      
    2 The prisoner’s sentence hearing took place on 26 April 2002. Because of delays in obtaining relevant reports in relation to the prisoner’s co-offender the sentences for both of them were not handed down until 26 August 2002. The prisoner received the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) In respect of the manslaughter of Tremain Watene he was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2012. There was a finding of special circumstances and the non-parole period in respect of this offence was fixed at 6 years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) In respect of the assault on GF he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2004. The sentence in respect of this offence was ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) In respect of the offence of affray he was sentence to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2003. This sentence was also ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
        
       
       
      The sentences referred to in (ii) and (iii) above have thus already expired. 
       
      
    3 The prisoner appealed against the severity of the sentences imposed on the following grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the sentencing proceedings miscarried because of the failure to comply with s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (the Act); 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s youth at the time he committed the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    4 The Court of Criminal Appeal (McColl JA, Grove and Dowd JJ) determined that the pre-sentence report tendered by the Crown at the sentence hearing, without objection on behalf of the prisoner, did not strictly comply with the provisions of Regulation 6(d), (e) and (f) of the regulations made under the Act. Those provisions require that the report relating to a prisoner to whom the Act applies must deal with the prisoner’s friends and associates (6(d)), the nature and extent of the prisoner’s participation in the life of the community (6(e)) and the prisoner’s disabilities (6(f)). Although many of the aspects required by the relevant regulation were before the court those referred to above were not. The Court of Criminal Appeal determined that there was no error demonstrated in the application of the principle of totality. However, because of the non-compliance with Regulation 6(d), (e) and (f) the matter was sent back for re-sentencing. It should be noted that in the Court of Criminal Appeal the question of the length of the sentence was not the subject of a determination.  
     
      
       
      STATUTORY MATTERS 
       
      
    5 The maximum penalty provided for manslaughter in s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 25 years. The maximum penalties for the other two offences need not be considered further in view of the structuring of the sentence that is proposed and the fact that the times limited by the sentences previously imposed have already expired.  
     
      
    6 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) makes provision for regard to be had to a number of considerations. The primary obligation of the Court is to impose a sentence that is appropriate to all the circumstances of the case. (s 21A(1)). For that purpose the Court must take into account the matters specified in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Sentencing Act. Those referred to in s 21A(2)(b) (c), (d), (e), (g), (i), (l) and (n), are relevant as are those specified in s21A(3)(i) and (j). In addition in imposing a sentence the Court must take into account any time which the offender has spent in custody in relation to the particular offence (s 24(a)). Furthermore, the age and antecedents of the prisoner are relevant considerations. So too is the effect of the offence on the victim and the family of the victim. However, this factor and its effect are to be understood in the manner defined in the decided cases. 
     
      
    7 Because of the age of the prisoner at the time he committed the offence for which he is to be sentenced, the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 must be taken into account. The youth of the prisoner at the time of the commission of the offences is a matter of considerable importance and in determining the sentences to be imposed in the present casse, I have had regard to this factor and to the other matters referred to in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Reference is to be made to such Act and its effect later in these reasons.  
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    8 For the purposes of re-sentencing the prisoner I adopt the matters and findings of fact in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 of my Remarks on Sentence of 26 August 2002. I also adopt paragraphs 39, 40, 41, 42, 49, 50 (subparagraphs 1 to 6 inclusive), 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 69 of such Remarks on Sentence. 
     
      
       
      PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY OF THE PRISONER 
       
      
    9 When he was sentenced in August 2002 the prisoner had two convictions. The first offence was for shoplifting on 18 April 2000 for which he was fined $100.00 on 8 May 2000. The second offence was for supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis on 22 November 2000. He was sentenced in the Sydney District Court on 22 June 2001 to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years in respect of this offence. The criminal record of the prisoner tendered in the present proceedings does not reveal any additional offences.  
     
      
       
      PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PRISONER 
       
      
    10 As indicated above, for the purposes of the present proceedings I adopt paragraphs 39, 40, 41, 42, 49 and 50 (sub paragraphs 1-6 inclusive) of my remarks on sentence of 26 August 2002. A report from the Department of Juvenile Justice was also tendered by the Crown. It was agreed that it was in accordance with the requirements of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the regulations made under such Act. It reveals in essence the facts referred to in paragraph 8 above, however, there is additional information concerning the prisoner’s two older brothers, namely, that they had recently been released from prison for drug charges and were staying with the prisoner’s mother who is unemployed. The prisoner reported a history of positive relationships with his mother and siblings but not with his father since the age of 14, when his mother and father separated. 
     
      
    11 The report reveals that he began to use cannabis shortly after the separation of his parents and by age 15 he was smoking heroin on a daily basis, however, this was not, according to him, as a result of anything done by his brothers. The report further reveals that after spending some 10 months on remand at a Juvenile Justice Centre as a result of the current offences, he was released in October 1998 and moved to Vietnam where he remained for six months with his grand parents. He said this was done to address his drug problem and avoid negative peer influence. 
     
      
    12 He returned to Australia in 1999 and rapidly became a heroin user again, however, by that time he was injecting the heroin rather than smoking it. 
     
      
    13 At age 18 the prisoner was remanded in adult custody for drug offences the sentence for which he has now completed. However he has remained in custody because of the current convictions in respect of which he now stands for sentence. 
     
      
    14 During the last three years that the prisoner has been in adult custody his mother has remained in close contact with him and his sister has also visited him. The prisoner claims a positive relationship with his mother and siblings, that she has always been supportive and has indicated her intention to continue this support for the foreseeable future. 
     
      
    15 During the time of his remand in the Juvenile Justice Centre he attended alcohol and other drug counselling, but after his release from that centre he did not continue with or undertake any further counselling or intervention. Since his imprisonment for the current offences he has, however, undertaken a number of courses. These are: 
     
      
    · a seven week course in relapse prevention (June 2002); 
     
      
    · “Writing for Self Expression” (May 2003); 
     
      
    · “Raising Awareness for Change (20 June 2003). This course included topics such as Facilitating Change, Self Esteem, Communication, Drug and Alcohol Awareness, Gambling Awareness and Vocational Orientation; 
     
      
    · Obtaining partial certificates in General Education for Adults Foundation (August 2003); 
     
      
    · Obtaining two certificates (2.6 and 2.7) in “Reading for Practical Purposes”; 
     
      
    · Completing level 2 “Anger Management”, level 2 “English” and a TAFE ESL course. 
     
      
       
      Whilst the content of some of these courses is unknown it is apparent that since his last sentence hearing the prisoner has undertaken a number of recognised courses within the prison system and I am of opinion that this is a positive feature for the prisoner. There was no evidence of such a kind at his sentence hearing in April 2002. 
       
      
    16 On the last occasion he was before me the prisoner did not give any evidence of remorse. He has, however, given such evidence at this hearing. Although this gave an impression of having been rehearsed, this could have been because of his limited command of English. Moreover, in a statement dated 27 August 2002 in which he applied for an opportunity to engage in an educational programme he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I am remorseful for the crime I have committed I feel it isn’t enough to prevent it from happening again. 
        
       
       
        
        This programme can help me beneficially. I hope you give me the opportunity to become a better person through this programme.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is clear from the documentation tendered that the prisoner was permitted to take part in the educational programme from which I infer that the prison authorities took the view that he was a worthwhile prospect for programmes of such a kind.  
     
      
    18 The foregoing indicates a change of attitude on the part of the prisoner. He has matched words with action, has deposed to his remorse and I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt in relation to remorse, although I still have some doubts about this matter.  
     
      
    19 The prisoner told the Juvenile Justice officer that he has no intention of being involved in further violent behaviour for the rest of his life. This statement is laudable, but does not sit well with the fact that a urine test in May 2003 was described in the prison records as “dirty”. He is, however, polite and courteous to staff and has been employed in the laundry shop and the packing shop. In September 2003 his Correctional Service case notes state: 
     
      
       
        
        “There have been no adverse reports on his running sheets. Fits in well with the wing.” 
        
       
      
    20 The prisoner denied that he was a member of any gang and informed the Juvenile Justice officer who prepared the report that was tendered to the court that at the time of the relevant offences he “was spending all his time with his co-offenders and other heroin users.” He said that he had not remained in contact with his co-offenders and other drug-using peers and does not intend to ever contact them again. I do not accept his denial in relation to his gang membership. As far as his co-offenders are concerned, being in prison would prevent him from making contact unless they were in the same prison and his statement about not initiating contact with other heroin users does not sit well with the matters referred to in paragraph 19 above.  
     
      
    21 The version of events given to the Juvenile Justice officer is quite self serving and inconsistent both with the verdict of the jury and my own findings of fact. Whilst it is understandable that the prisoner would wish to paint himself in as good a light as possible, his refusal or inability to face the facts as they are, poses problems for his rehabilitation. Admission of criminality is often a first step towards rehabilitation. The Juvenile Justice officer notes that “his honesty in regard to his account is questionable.” This, in my opinion, puts a complexion on his statements that is more favourable than the facts really allow.  
     
      
    22 The conclusion in the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice adverts to the prisoner’s vulnerability at the time the offence was committed due to his drug addiction, the fact that he lived in a troubled area and lacked a male role model. These are factors that I take into account in imposing the sentences for the offences for which the prisoner is to be re-sentenced. However, the prisoner’s problem with heroin is seen as a significant factor in relation to his future, so too is his need for further education. I think that heroin addiction remains a real problem. 
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PRISONER 
       
      
    23 At the forefront of the submissions on behalf of the prisoner is his youth at the time he committed the offences for which he is to be sentenced. It is a highly relevant matter and I take it into account. The principles embodied in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 apply. That which is relied on most heavily is the principle of taking into consideration that children who commit offences must bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance (GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112). 
     
      
    24 It is important in applying these principles to note that responsibility for their actions is part of the same consideration that requires their state of dependency, immaturity and need for guidance to be taken into account. They are considerations that will have varying effect according to the circumstances of the case. Where young offenders act like adults and commit adult crimes that are serious they may attract less leniency in sentencing than their age might otherwise support. However, where immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence then it may be fairly said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of mature years. Generally, the younger the offender the greater the weight to be given to the element of youth. Furthermore, the considerations of general deterrence are not of the same weight for a young person as they are for an adult. I take these considerations into account in fixing the sentences.  
     
      
    25 In the course of the submissions reference was made to the sentences imposed on other persons who were involved in events at Lahoods on 10 November 1997. I do not think that these references are of assistance. JD received a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a 12 month bond for the offence of affray. He pleaded guilty and assisted the authorities; indeed his evidence was significant in the trial of the prisoner. Andre Nasr received a sentence of 18 months periodic detention and a 12 month concurrent sentence for affray. He too pleaded guilty and gave evidence against MTN at his joint trial with the prisoner. HDN did not plead guilty. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 10 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray. His minimum term was fixed at 22 months and 18 days. 
     
      
    26 None of the persons referred to in paragraph 25 was convicted of an offence of the seriousness of that for which the prisoner was convicted and I do not think that any real assistance is obtained from the sentences imposed, particularly when regard is had to the spectrum of such sentences. 
     
      
    27 The written submissions on behalf of the prisoner also addressed the question of totality. Reference is made to the sentence of 3 years that was imposed on the prisoner on 22 June 2001 for the supply of prohibited drugs. It was submitted that some regard should be had to this fact when considering the commencement date of the sentences to be imposed. I do not agree. The offence for which the prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for three years was quite independent of the present offences. It was a drug offence. It was committed at a different place. It was committed at a different time. It was committed in different circumstances. To discount the appropriate sentence for the crimes for which the prisoner is now to be sentenced would in my opinion have the effect of giving him a benefit for his other criminality and send the wrong message to other persons who may be inclined to act as the prisoner acted on 10 November 1997. 
     
      
       
      STATISTICS 
       
      
    28 The statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in relation to penalties imposed for manslaughter were referred to. They show that in some 90 percent of the cases a sentence of imprisonment was imposed. In the submissions made on behalf of the prisoner reference was made to the median term derived from the statistics. In my opinion there are difficulties in using this mathematical concept as a datum. The first source of difficulty is the very nature of the crime of manslaughter itself. The second is the wide range of sentences revealed in the statistics. A third is that adverted to by the High Court in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 in which Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to attempt some statistical analysis of sentences for an offence which encompasses a very wide range of conduct and criminality … is fraught with danger, especially if the number of examples is small. It pretends to mathematical accuracy of analysis where accuracy is not possible. It may be mathematically possible to say of 20 or 30 examples of an offence … where the median or mean sentence lies. But to give any significance to the figure which is identified assumes a relationship between all members of the sample which cannot be assumed in so small a sample. To take only one difficulty, why were the highest and lowest sentences set as they were? (at 608) 
        
       
      
    29 Notwithstanding these difficulties, but bearing them in mind, it may still be of some assistance to consider the various statistics. The range of sentences revealed by the statistics relating to manslaughter is from 18 months to 20 years. The statistics also show that the head sentences in 80 percent of the cases range from 6 years to 14 years, with more than 33 1/3 percent of the sentences falling between 8 years and 14 years and that in just over 33 1/3 percent of the cases the non-parole periods range from 5 to 10 years. The outliers in the statistics, that is, head sentences below 4 years or above 14 years, account for only 11 percent of the sentences. It is highly likely that these sentences were imposed in respect of manslaughters committed in circumstances that were especially heinous on the one hand or of low culpability on the other.  
     
      
    30 The present case is not at the very high end of the spectrum of culpability nor is it in the lower levels of culpability. It was, as I have found, a deliberate group crime. It involved gratuitous violence. It involved planning. It involved a body of young men combining to attack two other young men. It was seen by the attackers, including the prisoner, as an act of revenge. It resulted in the death of one young man and the wounding of another. A clear message needs to be sent that such behaviour will be viewed by the courts in a most serious manner by the imposition of a condign penalty, even though the prisoner was a young person at the time of the offences.  
     
      
     
     
      
       
      
     
     
      
      CONCLUSION 
       
      
    31 When regard is had to the objective seriousness of the crime of manslaughter, the circumstances in which the subject manslaughter was committed and the subjective factors to which I have referred above, including the prisoner’s youth, the remorse expressed by him, his attempts to improve his lot whilst in prison and his apparently changed attitude since he was sentenced, I am of opinion that the sentence for manslaughter now to imposed on the prisoner should be reduced from 10 years to 8 ½ years and in view of the special circumstances I am of opinion that the non-parole period should be reduced from 6 years to 5 years. However, I do not think that the sentences imposed on the prisoner on 26 August 2002 in respect of the malicious wounding of GF and affray should be altered.  
     
      
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    32 CVH you have been convicted by a jury of your peers of the manslaughter of Tremain Watene on 10 November 1997, of assault on GF and affray on the same date. I impose the following sentences on you in respect of those offences. 
     
      
       
      (i) For the manslaughter of Tremain Watene I sentence you to imprisonment for eight and a half years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 June 2010 and I fix the non parole period in respect of this offence as five years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2007, on which date you will become eligible for consideration for parole. 
       
       
      (ii) For the assault on GF I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2004. This sentence is to be served concurrently with your sentence for manslaughter. 
       
       
      (iii) For the offence of affray I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2003. This sentence is to be served concurrently with your sentence for manslaughter.

12992,2769843,R v Hart (No 4) [2016] NSWSC 958,"Ex Tempore JUDGMENT (revised)


	
	I wish to record on the transcript that in chambers earlier today, in the presence of Mr Creasey SC, Mr Wilson SC directed me to the provisions of s 153 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and to the commentary on that section in the practice edited by R Howie and P Johnson, in answer to my question to him last week about whether, given the plea on arraignment, it was open to the accused to ask the jury for an acquittal of murder and, by implication, also of manslaughter. I am satisfied, having considered the material, that, with respect, Mr Wilson's submission should be accepted.
	
	
	In particular I have had regard to the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Broadbent [1964] VR 333. Having regard to the section and informed by the decision of the Victorian Full Court, I am satisfied that once the Crown elects not to accept the plea of guilty to the lesser offence, at least, where as here, that offence is not pleaded as an alternative count on the indictment, the plea uttered in the presence of the jury is treated as having been withdrawn and the trial continues on the count on the indictment.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, however, that the plea of guilty to manslaughter made in open court in the presence of the jury is admissible against the accused as an admission to which the jury may have regard against the accused when considering what the proper verdict should be.

11499,2760435,R v Brady [2012] NSWDC 222,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: A question has arisen as to whether an offence alleged under s 35 of the Crimes Act, as set out in the indictment, which alleges that the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to the victim is an offence of specific intent for the purpose of deciding if the accused could rely on self-induced intoxication. The first thing to observe is that s 35 is not listed as an offence of specific intent in the table to s 428B of Crimes Act. That might suggest that the offence is not one of specific intent. However, since the decision in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93 it has been necessary for the Crown to prove that an accused who acts recklessly must foresee the possibility that their actions will cause grievous bodily harm.

2In Grant v R (2002) 131 ACrimR 523 at [95] Wood J Chief Judge at common law said that when considering whether murder by reckless indifference is an offence of specific intent under pt 11A of the Crimes Act:

""There is at least a hint in that concluding passage in the speech of Lord Russell that there may be offences involving special malice forethought for which the effects of self induced intoxication remain relevant. In that regard, a distinction may properly be recognised between recklessness where a person does not apply his or her mind at all before undertaking an act and where that person does apply his or her mind and foreseeing the specific risk involved, nevertheless goes ahead regardless of it.""


3Lord Russell was one of the judges in DPP v Majewski [1977] AC 443.

4Those remarks suggest that there is a distinction to be made between offences such as this one where it is necessary for an accused to foresee a risk of something specific happening before he or she can be convicted and other offences where that is not required. What that distinction is and what effect it would have on this question was not really explained. Does it affect the decision as to whether an offence, which relies on an element of recklessness is to be regarded as an offence of specific intent?

5When a final ruling was made in Grant it was made in terms of the offence of murder only. An important part of the reasoning in that regard is that murder was left in the table to s 428B of the Act. Wood CJ at CL concluded:

""I have reached the conclusion that the legislature should be taken as having intended that murder in all of its forms should come within the operation of s 428C. Had it been intended to apply a distributive effect to it so that s 428C was applicable only to murder dependent upon intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, then it might have been expected that it would have been included in pt B of the table to s 428B(2) rather than in pt A.""

6As I have said, s 35 is not referred to in the table to s 428. But when pt 11A (Intoxication) was included in the Act s 35 was in a different form and it was not regarded as an offence of specific intent; see Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [97]

7However, the section was substantially changed thereafter. It was this new section that was being dealt with in the case of Blackwell. Blackwell made it clear that under the new section it was necessary for the accused to not merely contemplate the possibility that some harm would be occasioned by his actions but that such harm amounted to grievous bodily harm.

8It seems to me that the starting point for consideration of the question posed must be the terms of s 428B itself. That section states that an offence of specific intent is an offence of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element. A number of sections are set out in a table to the section but the section also says that the table only provides examples of such offences. Clearly the sections set out in the table are not the only sections that might be held to contain offences of specific intent.

9A simple reading of the words of s428B does not suggest that s 35 is an offence of specific intent. (Note that s35 has been amended again, removing the requirement to prove that the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm). Recklessness imports a concept of taking an unjustified risk rather than having a specific intent. Recklessness is an easier state of mind to prove than intention. It has been said that, ""Intention cannot exist without foresight but foresight can exist without intention:"" Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law 19th edition at para 24. That simple statement demonstrates the clear distinction between the two concepts. 

10Even when looking at the decision in Grant I note that Wood CJ at CL, before reaching his final decision that all forms of murder should be interpreted as being crimes of specific intent, said at [33] that reckless indifference to life murder is not a crime of specific intent as such. He said: 

""To prove reckless indifference to human life an accused need not be shown to have specifically intended or wanted death to result, only that he or she comprehended that there was a real or substantial likelihood of it occurring and went ahead regardless. As such, it is strictly not a crime of specific intent"",

11Those remarks seem to me to be consistent with a finding that s 35 is not a crime of specific intent.

12I am not aware of any other judgment or authority on this issue and having considered the question I am of the view that an offence under s 35, as stated in the indictment, is not an offence of specific intent under s 428B of the Crimes Act and in this case I will direct the jury accordingly.

		21 December 2012",2012-11-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
5424,2704990,Application by Darush Majid pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 709,"Judgment1Darush Majid (""the applicant"") makes application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Puckeridge QC in the District Court on 18 December 2008.  
2On 22 April 2008 a jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of each of three counts against the applicant.  The first two counts alleged offences of aggravated sexual assault upon a victim aged 15 years.  Each of those offences was contrary to s. 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW and each carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3The third count of which the applicant was found guilty was an offence of detaining for advantage contrary to s. 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  That offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  No standard non-parole period was prescribed.
4The applicant was sentenced by his Honour as follows:
(i)in respect of count 1, a period of 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 years;
(ii)in respect of count 2, 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment; and
(iii)in respect of count 3, a fixed term of 8 years imprisonment.
5The total effective sentence was one of 14 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment.
6The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In making that application the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].
THE APPLICANT'S SENTENCE7It is not necessary for the purposes of the present application to set out the circumstances of the applicant's offending.  The sentencing judge did so at some length (at ROS 1 - 5) before finding (at ROS 6) that the applicant had admitted his guilt following the jury's verdict, and had expressed remorse for his actions.  His Honour took this into account along with evidence given by the applicant as to difficulties he had experienced in his youth (commencing at ROS 11).  His Honour also took into account (at ROS 13-15) two psychological reports which were tendered before him.
8His Honour concluded (at ROS 15) that the offending was ""serious"" and noted (at ROS 16) that in respect of count 1 it was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was in a position of authority.  He also concluded (at ROS 16) that the emotional harm to the victim of the offending was ""substantial"".  His Honour then said (at ROS 16):
""I do take into account in balancing the mitigating factors the remorse which the offender has now expressed. I also take into account his background and the evidence which he has given as to events which has (sic) occurred in his past life, and the evidence and history which he gave to Mr Tim Watson-Munro. Consideration of that evidence is such however that I accept the submission that has been made by the Crown that whilst his background and his drug abuse may have had some effect on his impulse control he, the offender, knew that what he was doing was wrong. I accept that the offender by his admission now of guilt and from what has been stated in his statement to the court, exhibit 1, accepts responsibility for his actions and for the wrong which he has committed on the victim"".
9His Honour concluded (at ROS 17-18): 
""It had been put on behalf of the offender that the offence (in count 1) was not in the mid range of objective seriousness. The offence subject of the first count and the offence the subject of the second count carries (sic) a standard non-parole period of ten years. It is in relation to that standard non-parole period that the court was addressed as to whether the offence fell in the mid range of seriousness or not. I accept in relation to the offence (in count 1), balancing those matters which I have previously considered and with the absence of calculated planning by the offender, that it does not fall within the mid-range but not significantly below it. The offender took advantage of a young person and ought to have known better. I would consider that the appropriate sentence in relation to the first count would be a period of imprisonment of twelve years and a non-parole period of nine years.
I have taken into account the background of the offender and taken into account the effect of what he observed and saw in the turmoil in Afghanistan and the effect of what occurred when a bomb went off in the vicinity of his home. Having taken that into account, I do not consider that there should be any further discount in respect of that non-parole period of nine years.
In respect of the second count which as I have stated is of a more calculated nature I consider that in the circumstances of that offence a standard non-parole period should apply. The sentence in relation to that offence will be a period of a imprisonment of fourteen years with a non-parole period of ten.
In respect of the third count, again I have taken into account the vulnerable position of the victim and that the purpose of the detention was to obtain an advantage, namely sexual gratification. I will (sic) consider the period of imprisonment appropriate for that offence would be a period of imprisonment of eight years. In view of the non-parole period which I have set in respect of the first and second count, I do not propose to impose a non-parole period"".
10His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences that I have previously outlined.
11The applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentences imposed and advanced five separate grounds in that regard.  The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the sentencing judge had erred in calculating the head sentence in respect of the second count.  Leave to appeal against sentence was granted, and the sentence of imprisonment on the second count was quashed.  The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed.  The effect of the Court's orders was that the total term imposed in respect of the second count was reduced from one of 14 years imprisonment to one of 13 years and 4 months imprisonment (see Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121).
12One of the grounds advanced by the applicant before the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  In determining this ground Johnson J (with whom Simpson and McCallum JJ agreed) said the following (at [63]):
""[63] The Applicant, then aged 25 years, committed separate and serious sexual assault offences upon a 15-year old girl. Having regard to the employment relationship between the Applicant and the victim, the offences constituted a breach of trust on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant used force and penile/vaginal intercourse took place on both occasions. The standard non-parole period had direct application to this case as the Applicant was convicted after trial. The sentencing Judge assessed the first sexual assault offence as not falling within the mid-range but not being significantly below it, and the second sexual assault offence was assessed as lying within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, so as to attract application of the standard non-parole period. These assessments with respect to objective seriousness were not challenged in any ground of appeal. 
[64] The second offence involved a repeated sexual assault offence against the victim committed about a month after the first offence. Both were serious offences involving the taking of the victim to an isolated place so that the Applicant could use her, without her consent, for his own sexual purposes. 
[65] The Applicant's criminal history revealed a range of offences for which non-custodial sentences had been passed. It may be inferred that the Applicant's troubled and traumatic childhood in Afghanistan had been taken into account in his favour on sentence on more than one occasion. However, by December 2006, the Applicant had been living in Australia for 13 years and had been raised and educated here and was in gainful employment. 
[66] The application and operation of the standard non-parole period provisions to the sentencing of the Applicant assist an understanding of the length of the sentences imposed. It has not been demonstrated that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust (my emphasis).""
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES13On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the standard non-parole period was a dominant factor, both at first instance and on appeal, and that the outcome in each case was ""heavily influenced by the prevailing approach mandated by R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 to the sentencing of offenders for standard non-parole period offences"".  
14It was submitted, in particular, that Johnson J's reference to the standard non-parole period having ""direct application"" was a clear error.  In this regard, reliance was placed on the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock (supra) at [29] as well as the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117 at [70].15Finally, it was submitted that the present case was a clear example of both the sentencing judge, and the Court of Criminal Appeal, giving determinative significance, in respect of counts 1 and 2, to the application of the standard non-parole period.  This, it was submitted, was evident from the remarks of the sentencing judge extracted at [9] above, and from the observations of Johnson J at [63]-[66].
16Counsel for the Attorney-General submitted that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to a Muldrock type error.  However as Johnson J pointed out in The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17], such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383.
17Counsel for the Attorney-General further submitted that careful consideration needed to be given to the role that the standard non-parole period played in the sentencing process, both at first instance and on appeal.  It was submitted that merely showing that the sentencing judge had sentenced, pre-Muldrock, by following the dictates of Way was not sufficient to demonstrate error, and that what was required to be ascertained in such a case was whether reliance on Way had sufficiently infected a sentence with error, such that intervention was warranted (see generally Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 172).
18It was submitted that the sentencing judge had considered the entirety of the objective and subjective features of the case before reaching his conclusions and that there was accordingly no error in that regard.  In respect of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, counsel for the Attorney-General appeared to acknowledge that Johnson J's reference to the standard non-parole period having ""direct application"" was of some significance.  However, it was submitted that it was necessary to read and consider that observation in light of the entirety of the judgment and that when such an approach was taken, it was evident that Johnson J had done nothing more than view the standard non-parole period as benchmark.  
19Finally, it was submitted that there was nothing arising out of the judgment of Johnson J which indicated that his Honour had adopted a two-stage approach to the question of sentence.  
CONSIDERATION20In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded at [25] that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms which required the court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The Court also concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period and held that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
21Further (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.
22In arriving at these conclusions, the court held that the decision in Way (supra) was incorrect.
23In my view, there is nothing within the remarks of the sentencing judge in the present case which would indicate that he gave primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period, or that he engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing.  As I have outlined, his Honour spent some considerable time identifying the entirety of the aggravating and mitigating factors before arriving at what he considered to be an appropriate sentence.  Indeed, his Honour (at ROS 17) expressly noted that he had balanced all of the matters to which he had previously referred in arriving at a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.  
24In support of the submission that error was demonstrated in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant placed some considerable reliance upon the decision in Achurch (No 2) (supra).  In particular, the applicant drew attention to the fact that in that case, an observation as to the direct applicability of the standard non-parole period had also been made at the time of the sentence being imposed.  It was submitted, in effect, that because the Court of Criminal Appeal had found error in that case, the same conclusion should be reached in the case of the applicant. 
25I am unable to accept that submission.  It reflects an approach which disregards those authorities which make it clear that when determining whether or not there has been a Muldrock-type error, the entirety of the judgment in question must be considered.  An approach which has, as its focus, an isolated passage or statement is an erroneous one (see for example Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265).  
26In my view, when the judgment of Johnson J is read as a whole it becomes evident that the entirety of the circumstances were taken into account in reaching the conclusion that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were not manifestly excessive.  There is nothing in the Court's judgment which would indicate that the standard non-parole period was used in a determinative (and thus impermissible) way, or that a two-stage process of sentencing was undertaken.  
CONCLUSION27For the reasons set out above I am not persuaded that there was any Muldrock- type error, either when the applicant was sentenced or when he was subsequently dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
28Accordingly I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.
ORDERS
29For the foregoing reasons I make the following order:
(i)The application is refused.

INTRODUCTION

 

The applicant Ian Walter Brookfield (""Mr Brookfield"") is a
qualified master plumber.  In 1988 he
registered the business name ""Brookfield
Plumbing Services"".  Trading
under that business name, Mr Brookfield initially concentrated on the
installation of septic tanks.

 

In about February 1989 Mr Brookfield received a
telephone call from a Mr Robert Myles (""Mr
Myles"").  Mr Myles was a
director of the company Allwater Treatment Pty Limited (""Allwater""). 
Allwater was licensed to manufacture and sell a waste water system known
as the ""Parco Beaver Aerobic Septic
System"" (""the Parco Beaver
system"").  An Australian patent
application had been made in respect of the Parco Beaver system on behalf of
Parco Pty Ltd (""Parco"").  Following negotiations between Mr Brookfield,
Mr Myles and a Mr McCaig, also apparently a director of Allwater, Mr
Brookfield became a shareholder, with Messrs Myles and McCaig, in the company
Waterite (SA) Pty Ltd (""Waterite"").  Waterite became the supplier of Parco Beaver
systems in South Australia.  Mr
Brookfield installed the Parco Beaver systems using the business name
Brookfield Plumbing Services.

 

In early 1990 Mr Brookfield commenced
installing a modified version of the Parco Beaver system.  The elements of the Parco Beaver system, and
Mr Brookfield's modification of the Parco Beaver system, are discussed below.

 




Mr Brookfield's involvement with Mr Myles and
Mr McCaig in Waterite lasted only about 9 months.  Thereafter he continued to install Parco
Beaver systems, but until September 1990 he obtained such systems directly from
Allwater.  A provisional liquidator was
appointed to Allwater in September 1990.

 

Following the appointment of the provisional
liquidator of Allwater, Mr Brookfield sought access to the Parco Beaver system
by other means.  He contacted a Mr Lucas
Mueller (""Mr Mueller"") who
was, and is, a director of Parco.  Parco
had registered the trademark ""Parco
Beaver"" and, as mentioned above, was the entity on whose behalf a
patent application had been made in respect of the Parco Beaver system.  Parco had earlier assigned its rights with
respect to the Parco Beaver system to Allwater. 
It re-acquired such rights from the liquidator of Allwater.

 

A deed dated 6 December 1990 was entered into
between Parco and Mr Brookfield whereby Mr Brookfield was licensed to
manufacture and sell in Australia the Parco Beaver system.  The deed authorised Mr Brookfield to
incorporate a company named Parco Beaver Australia Pty Limited on the basis
that, upon its incorporation, the agreement contained in the deed would be
cancelled and an agreement in identical terms would be entered into between
Parco and that company.  A company was
incorporated and eventually named Parco Beaver Australia Pty Limited.  It did not enter into an agreement with
Parco.  Parco Beaver Australia Pty
Limited subsequently changed its name to Septic Products Australia Pty
Ltd.  It is the second applicant.

In about March 1991 an informal joint venture
agreement was entered into between Mr Brookfield and the second applicant, then
called Parco Beaver Australia Pty Ltd. 
Assets and liabilities of Mr Brookfield's business, Brookfield Plumbing
Services, were transferred to the second applicant on 1 July 1991.  Mr Brookfield had been the chief
executive officer and a director of the second applicant from December 1990.  He continued in those positions.

 

Mr Brookfield, apparently on legal advice,
claimed in May 1991 that he had entered into the deed between him and Parco as
a result of actionable misrepresentations. 
Considerable correspondence followed between the respective legal
advisers to Mr Brookfield and Parco.

 

In September 1991 Mr Brookfield received
provisional patent approval for a waste water system described as the BPS
Trickle Filter System (""BPS
system"").  Thereafter he
installed only BPS systems:  that is, he
no longer installed the Parco Beaver system either in its strict form or in the
modified form developed by him.  It
appears, however, that until the making of certain orders in the Supreme Court
of New South Wales, which are referred to below, such BPS systems were
probably sold under the name Parco Beaver.

 

In early November 1991 the patent application
for the Parco Beaver system was accepted and Australian Patent No.618248 was
sealed on 4 May 1992.

On 9 January 1992 Parco gave notice of
termination of the deed between it and Mr Brookfield on the ground of non-performance
by Mr Brookfield of his obligations thereunder.

 

Proceedings were instituted against Mr
Brookfield and Parco Beaver Australia Pty Limited in the Supreme Court of
New South Wales.  On 17 June 1992
interlocutory orders were obtained in such proceedings which, amongst other
things, restrain Mr Brookfield and Parco Beaver Australia Pty Limited from
manufacturing or selling any product under the name of Parco Beaver.  Shortly thereafter the name of the second
applicant was changed to Septic Products Pty Ltd.  The second applicant will hereafter generally
be referred to as ""Septic Products"" even when events are being
discussed which occurred before its change of name.

 

Shortly after Allwater went into provisional
liquidation, Mr Brookfield made contact with the first respondent (""Davey Products""), a supplier
of pumps.  He spoke by telephone with
Mr Dallas Wilsdon (""Mr
Wilsdon""), the South Australian manager of Davey Products.  Mr Wilsdon had already identified the waste
water industry as a potential source of sales for pumps, and Mr Brookfield
as a potential buyer of pumps.  In
circumstances discussed below, arrangements were put in place for Davey
Products to supply Mr Brookfield with two models of pump, the Davey Lowara Doc
3 (""the Doc 3 pump"") and
the Davey Lowara Doc 7 (""the Doc 7
pump"").  The Doc 3 pump was to
be used in lieu of the Grundfos KP 100 pump (""the KP 100 pump"") 
as a recirculation pump.  The Doc
7 pump was already being used by Mr Brookfield as an irrigation pump.  Subsequently Davey Products provided ""Sumprat"" pumps to
Mr Brookfield.  The Sumprat pumps
were of a substantially identical design to the Davey Lowara Doc pumps.  There was a Sumprat pump equivalent for both
the Doc 3 and the Doc 7 pumps.

 

The applicants experienced problems with all
models of pump supplied by Davey Products. 
The nature of these problems are discussed below.  In October 1991 Mr Brookfield advised Davey
Products that the second applicant would no longer use its pumps.  Thereafter the second applicant obtained
pumps first from the second respondent and then from the third respondent.  Problems were also experienced by the second
applicant with the pumps obtained from those parties.

 

The second applicant was placed in liquidation
on 5 April 1993.

 

WASTE WATER SYSTEMS

(a)  Parco Beaver System

 

Annexure 1 to these reasons is a diagram
illustrating the principal features of the Parco Beaver system.

 

The Parco Beaver system utilises two tanks each
divided into two compartments.  The first
tank serves as a settlement tank with primary settlement taking place in its
larger compartment.  Waste water, with
limited solids, flows from the smaller compartment of the first tank into the
larger compartment of the second tank. 
The larger compartment of the second tank is known as the holding
tank.  It is situated beneath a
bio-filter module.  The waste water is repeatedly
pumped by a recirculation pump above the bio-filter module from where it
trickles through the filter medium back to the holding tank.  By this process clarification of the waste
water is achieved.  Clarified waste water
flows into the smaller compartment of the second tank where it is treated with
chlorine.  From this compartment it is
pumped by the irrigation pump out of the system, usually through a garden
irrigation system.

 

(b)  Modified Parco Beaver System

 

The Parco Beaver system utilises short lengths
of cut plastic piping held within a concrete bowl as its filter medium.  It is this aspect of the system which Mr
Brookfield modified.  The modification
involved the replacement of the cut plastic piping with a series of plastic
discs set one above the other on a horizontal plane (""the disc pack""). 
The discs had a regular pattern of small holes drilled through them so
as to allow water discharged over the top disc to trickle through the series of
discs and return to the holding tank.

 

(c)  BPS System

 

The BPS system is, in essence, a modification
devised by Mr Brookfield of the Parco Beaver system.  The settlement tank is not materially
different from that used in the Parco Beaver system.  The second tank as designed for the BPS
system is illustrated in annexure 2 to these reasons.  The significant differences between the
second tank of the Parco Beaver system and the second tank of the BPS system
include the following:-

 

     (a)  the
BPS system used the disc pack as the filter medium rather than the cut pipe
used in the Parco Beaver systems;

 

     (b)  the
BPS system did not use a concrete filter bowl but rather a free-standing PVC
column which supported the disc pack;

 

     (c)  in
the BPS system the stilling chamber extended to the floor of the tank although
it had a 100 millimetre diameter circular opening 50 millimetres above the
floor of the tank.  In the Parco Beaver
system the stilling chamber was open at the bottom and did not reach to the
floor of the tank;

 

     (d)  the
BPS system returned water which had passed over the filter packs to the
stilling chamber.  The Parco Beaver
system returned such water to the outside of the stilling chamber.

 

THE PARTIES

 

The applicants are Mr Brookfield and Septic
Products Australia Pty Ltd (In Liquidation). 
During final addresses it became apparent that the liquidator of Septic
Products had no 
involvement in these proceedings and had never been intended to have any.  It was Mr Brookfield who had given
instructions for the proceedings to be issued in the name of Septic Products.  I raised with Mr Cameron, who with Mr Moffa
appeared for the applicants, the basis upon which Mr Brookfield purported to be
entitled to use the name of Septic Products in this litigation.  This query resulted in disclosure of a deed
of assignment which had not at that stage been either discovered or referred to
in the pleadings.  These serious deficiencies
in the conduct of the case of the applicants have now been rectified.

 

It is appropriate to set out the terms of the
deed in full:-

     ""THIS DEED is made

These proceedings were instituted in the names
of Mr Brookfield and Septic Products as applicants on 1 November 1993.  That is, 4 days after the deed was executed.

 

Counsel for the applicants did not seek to
uphold the deed as a legal assignment by Septic Products of any chose or choses
in action.  It was acknowledged that
there had been no compliance with s15 of the Law of Property Act 1976
(S.A.).  However, it was sought to uphold
the deed as an equitable assignment of the choses in action referred to in the
pleadings.  Ultimately the applicants
were granted leave to amend their statement of claim to include the following
paragraph:-

 

     ""2A.Further, and in the alternative, on the 28th
day of October 1993, the liquidator of the second applicant affected (sic) an
assignment in equity of the second applicants chose in action to the first
applicant subject to the terms expressed in a deed dated 28 October 1993
subject to the consideration referred to in the deed.  The applicants will refer to the contents of
the deed for its full effect and import.""

 

 

The deed does not expressly authorise the
institution of proceedings in the name of Septic Products.  It may be that it does so by implication, but
no argument to this effect was put to me.

 

It was not contended on behalf of the
applicants that Septic Products retains any beneficial interest in its ""... right, title and interest as
applicant ..."" in these proceedings (see recital C to the
deed).  Plainly enough, however, Septic
Products retains its choses in action at law: 
assuming for the moment the validity of the deed, Mr Brookfield's rights
under the deed are rights in equity.

 

The position with respect to necessary parties
to an action where a cause of action has been assigned in equity was expressed
by Peter Gibson LJ in Three Rivers
District Council v Bank of England [1995] 4 All ER 312 at 331 as follows:-

 

     ""... the equitable
assignee can be regarded realistically as the person entitled to the assigned
chose and is able to sue the debtor on that chose, but that save in exceptional
circumstances the Court will require him to join the assignor as a procedural
requirement so that the assignor might be bound and the debtor protected.  If, unusually, the assignor sues, he will not
be allowed to maintain the action in the absence of the assignee.""

 

In McIntyre
v Gye and Another (1994) 122 ALR 289 at 295 the Full Court of this
Court adopted the same approach stating:-

 

     ""... where there is an
equitable assignment of a legal chose in action, the assignor should be a party
to an action to recover the debt, either as plaintiff or defendant ...""

 

Accepting, as I do, that Septic Products is a
necessary party to these proceedings, what steps ought to have been taken by
Mr Brookfield to achieve this end? 
He could have negotiated an agreement with the liquidator of Septic
Products whereby the liquidator authorised the institution of proceedings in
the name of Septic Products.  It was not
contended that had been done.  Other
possible courses of action are canvassed by the Full Court of this Court in
Christianos & Ors v Aloridge Pty Ltd
& Anor (1995) 13 ACLC 1,851 at 1,858. 
Although the Full Court in that case made no reference to the decision
of the Full Court of 
the Supreme Court of South Australia in Russell
& Anor v Westpac Banking Corporation & Ors (1994) 61 SASR 583, I do
not regard the two decisions as incompatible. 
In Russell & Anor v Westpac
Banking Corporation & Ors at 585 King CJ, with whom the other
members of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia agreed,
said:-

 

     ""The general rule, being
that which is generally referred to as the rule in
Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461; 67 ER
189, is that for a wrong done to a company, the company is the proper plaintiff
in an action to seek redress.  When the
company is in liquidation, the person in whom is vested the authority to
institute proceedings, is the liquidator: 
Scarel Pty Ltd v City Loan & Credit Corporation Pty Ltd (No.2) (1988) 17 FCR 344.  There is power, however, in the Court to
authorise other persons to conduct litigation in the name of the company:  Cape Breton Co v Fenn (1881) 17 ChD 198; Aliprandi v Griffith Vintners Pty Ltd (In liq) (1991) 6 ACSR 250.""

 

During final addresses an application was made
to the Court for Mr Brookfield to be granted authority to conduct this
litigation using the name of Septic Products as a co-applicant.  Evidence was placed before the Court in
support of that application.  In ruling
that the application should be allowed I said:-

     ""... the nature of the
leave I propose to give reflects the nature of [the] assignment and in a sense
the technical nature of the name of the company being used.  So on that basis, on the notice of motion of
20 September 1995 it is formally ordered:

 

     (1)  that Ian Walter Brookfield is authorised with effect from the date
of the commencement of these proceedings at his own expense and risk as to
costs to use the name of Septic Products Australia Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) as
a co-applicant in these proceedings ...""

 

Septic Products may thus be seen as a party
joined in these proceedings to satisfy the procedural requirement as to joinder

of an assignor of a chose in action.  By
reason of the execution by the liquidator of Septic Products of the deed of 28
October 1993, Septic Products cannot be seen as a party itself entitled to
relief from the respondents to these proceedings.  It has purported to assign those rights to Mr
Brookfield.  I do not understand the
contrary to have been argued.

 

It was, however, argued that Mr Brookfield has
legitimate claims for relief against the respondents which are independent of
any rights assigned to him pursuant to the deed of 28 October 1993.  This argument is considered below.

 

I turn to the respondents.  Each of them was at some time a supplier of
pumps to the applicants or one of them. 
The proceedings were settled between the applicants and the second and
third respondents respectively close to the date upon which these proceedings
were listed for hearing.

 

The hearing thus proceeded between the
applicants and the first respondent only. 
The first respondent will hereafter be referred to as ""the respondent"".

 

CAUSES OF ACTION ALLEGED

 

Neither the application in this matter, nor the
statement of claim, draws any distinction between claims for relief made on
behalf of the first applicant in his own name and claims made in reliance on
the deed of 28 October 1993.  For the
purpose of 
simply identifying the causes of action pleaded I will also draw no distinction
between the applicants.

 

Section
52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (""the
Trade Practices Act"")

 

The applicants claim by their application a
declaration that the respondent has engaged in conduct constituting
contravention of s52 of the Trade Practices Act, and damages pursuant to s52 of
the Trade Practices Act as a consequence of such conduct.  The claim for damages is to be understood as
a claim pursuant to s82 of the Trade Practices Act.

 

Section 52(1) of the Trade Practices Act
provides as follows:-

 

     ""A corporation shall not,
in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is
likely to mislead or deceive.""

 

Paragraph 39 of the statement of claim makes it
clear that the complaints made under s52 of the Trade Practices Act, so far as
the Doc 3 pumps are concerned, relate to alleged representations that the Doc 3
pump was capable of adequately being substituted for the KP 100 pump and that
the Doc 3 pump was capable of working in the waste water system being produced
by the applicants.

 

Doc 7 pumps were being installed by the
applicants in their waste water system before any direct contact between the
applicants and the respondent.  Paragraph
20 of the statement of claim pleads as follows:-

     ""It was an express or
alternatively implied term of the sale and purchase of the Doc 7 pumps that
they were of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose of pumping septic
waste water.""

 

Paragraph 39 of the statement of claim pleads
that in the light of para 20, which is set out above, the respondent engaged in
conduct contrary to s52 of the Trade Practices Act by representing that the Doc
7 pump ""... was capable of working
in the waste water treatment systems produced by Brookfield which systems were
known to Davey.""

 

As to the Sumprat pump, the statement of claim
pleads that, after advising Mr Brookfield of a manufacturing fault with the Doc
3 pump, an employee of the respondent told Mr Brookfield that the respondent ""... would supply an alternative pump
called a Sumprat as a suitable replacement for the Doc 3 pumps ..."".  Paragraph 39 of the statement of claim pleads
that the respondent thus engaged in conduct contrary to s52 of the Trade
Practices Act by representing that the Sumprat pump was capable of adequately
being substituted for the KP 100 pump and ""...
was capable of working in the waste water treatment systems produced by
Brookfield which systems were known to Davey.""

 

Section 71 of the Trade Practices Act

 

The application claims damages for breach of
s71 of the Trade Practices Act.

 

Section 71 of the Trade Practices Act provides
as follows:-

     ""(1)Where a corporation supplies (otherwise than by
way of sale by auction) goods to a consumer in the course of a business, there
is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract for the
supply of the goods are of merchantable quality, except that there is no such
condition by virtue only of this section -

 

          (a)  as regards
defects specifically drawn to the consumer's attention before the contract is
made; or

 

          (b)  if the consumer
examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that
examination ought to reveal.

 

      (2)Where
a corporation supplies (otherwise than by way of sale by auction) goods to a
consumer in the course of a business and the consumer, expressly or by
implication, makes known to the corporation or to the person by whom any
antecedent negotiations are conducted any particular purpose for which the
goods are being acquired, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied
under the contract for the supply of the goods are reasonably fit for that
purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly
supplied, except where the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely,
or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the
corporation or of that person.

 

      (3)(not
here relevant).""

 

As Brennan J pointed out in Arturi v Zupps Motors Pty Ltd and Another
(1980) 49 FLR 283 at 285:-

     ""Section 71 prescribes no
norm of conduct:  it affects the legal
relationship between parties to a contract by importing one or more conditions
into the contract.  It does not proscribe
conduct by the supplier of goods; it relates to the quality of the goods
supplied.""

 

It follows, as his Honour there pointed out,
that a breach of the obligation statutorily created by s71 does not amount to
conduct that was done in contravention of a provision of Part V of the Trade
Practices Act for the purposes of a claim for damages pursuant to s82 of that
Act.

Nonetheless a party may sue for a breach of an
implied condition imported into a contract by reason of s71.  Such a condition will, however, only be
implied into a contract where, in the opening words of ss(1) and (2) of s71, ""... a corporation supplies ... goods
to a consumer ..."".  Section
4B(1) of the Trade Practices Act provides as follows:-

     ""For the purposes of this
Act, unless the contrary intention appears -

 

     (a)  a person shall be taken to have acquired particular goods as a
consumer if, and only if -

 

          (i)  (not here
relevant)

 

              or

 

          (ii)(not here
relevant)

 

          and the person did not
acquire the goods, or hold himself out as acquiring the goods, for the purpose
of resupply or for the purpose of using them up or transforming them, in trade
or commerce, in the course of a process of production or manufacture or of
repairing or treating other goods or fixtures on land; ...""

 

Negligent Misrepresentation

 

Paragraph 40 of the statement of claim pleads
that the respondent owed to the applicants a duty of care in and about the
making of certain representations described as ""the representations aforesaid"".  The identification of such representations is
a more complicated task than ideally it ought to be.

 

Paragraph 13 of the statement of claim pleads
that in ""... October 1990 and
as a result of the representations made by Davey through its servant or agent
Wilsdon to Brookfield in 
October 1990, Brookfield started to incorporate the Doc 3 pumps into the first
compartment of the holding tank of the Parco Beaver System in substitution for
the KP 100 pumps"".  The
representations referred to in paragraph 13 would appear to be those pleaded in
paragraphs 10, 10.1 and 12 of the statement of claim.

 

By paragraph 20.6 of the statement of claim the
applicants plead that it ""... was as
a result of the representations made by Davey through its servant or agent,
Wilsdon, to Brookfield in October 1990 that Brookfield continued to incorporate
the Doc 7 pumps into the irrigation tank of the Parco Beaver System"".  The representations referred to in paragraph
20.6 would appear to be those pleaded, expressly or by implication, in
paragraphs 20.3, 20.4 and 20.5 of the statement of claim.

 

There is no express plea in the statement of
claim that the applicants or either of them purchased and used Sumprat pumps as
a consequence of any conduct of the respondent. 
However, paragraph 26 of the statement of claim pleads that in
approximately early 1992 an employee of the respondent told Mr Brookfield ""... that there was a manufacturing
fault with the Doc 3 pumps and that they would supply an alternative pump
called a Sumprat as a suitable replacement for the Doc 3 pump ..."",
and paragraph 27 pleads that Mr Brookfield ""...
thereafter commenced incorporating the Sumprat pump in substitution for the Doc
3 pump in the Parco Beaver System"". 
I note, incidentally, that there is a clear conflict between the time
here pleaded (approximately 
early 1992) and the evidence concerning the supply of Sumprat pumps.  The appropriate inference to be drawn from
paragraphs 26 and 27 of the statement of claim is, presumably, that the respondent
represented that the Sumprat pump was a suitable replacement for the Doc 3 pump
and that Mr Brookfield relied on that representation in incorporating the
Sumprat pump into the Parco Beaver system.

 

In view of the above pleadings it seems
reasonable to conclude that the representations referred to in paragraph 40 of
the statement of claim are those pleaded in paragraphs 10, 10.1, 12, 20.3,
20.4, 20.5 and 26 of the statement of claim.

 

Paragraph 41 of the statement of claim is in
the following terms:-

 

     ""Davey recklessly and in
breach of its duty of care to the Applicants failed to ensure that the Doc 3
pumps, the Doc 7 pumps and the Sumprat pumps were capable of working in the
Parco Beaver System and the BPS MK9 System for the expected life of the unit
which by Industry standards ought properly to have been at least 3-5 years
continuous use as has been demonstrated by KP 100 pumps installed as early as
1987, which were still in operation in April 1993 when Septic Products was
liquidated.""

 

 

The duty of care referred to in paragraph 41 is
presumably that pleaded in paragraph 40, namely the duty to take care in and
about the making of representations.  So
read, the plea of breach of duty does not in express terms match the duty
pleaded by paragraph 40.  This aspect of
the case is considered further below.




Damages
pursuant to the Misrepresentation Act 1972 (S.A.) (""the Misrepresentation Act"").

 

Although the application claims damages
pursuant to the Misrepresentation Act there is no express reference to the
Misrepresentation Act in the statement of claim.  No reference to the Misrepresentation Act is
made in the applicants' final written submissions nor was any such reference
made in the final address of counsel for the applicants.  It need not be further considered.

 

Breach of contract

 

The application claims damages for breach of
contract.  The statement of claim makes
it plain that this claim flows from allegations, as to the Doc 3 and Sumprat
pumps, that ""[i]t was an express or
alternatively implied term of the contract for the sale and purchase of [such]
pumps that they were of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose made known
to Davey.""  (statement of claim
paras 14, 17.3 and 31.1)  As to the Doc 7
pump it is pleaded that:-

 

     ""It was an express or
alternatively implied term of the sale and purchase of Doc 7 pumps that they
were of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose of pumping septic waste
water."" (statement of claim para.20)

 

 

For the reasons set out below, these pleas can
not be supported by reference to s71 of the Trade Practices Act.  Section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1895
(S.A.) (""the Sale of Goods Act"")
is, however, also relied upon.

Section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act provides,
so far as is here relevant, as follows:-

 

     ""14.Subject to the provisions of this Act, and of
any Statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the
quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a
contract of sale, except as follows:-

 

          I    Where the buyer,
expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose
for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the
seller's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in
the course of the seller's business to supply ..., there is an implied
condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose:  Provided that in the case of a contract for
the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is
no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose;

 

          II   Where goods are
bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description ...,
there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable
quality:  Provided that if the buyer has
examined the goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects
which such examination ought to have revealed ...""

 

 

Exemplary Damages

 

The application claims exemplary damages.  No submissions in support of this claim were
made.  It may be treated as having been
abandoned.

 

DOES
MR BROOKFIELD HAVE A PERSONAL RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONDENT?

 

No attempt was made in this case to prove loss
or damage suffered by Mr Brookfield directly. 
The case for the applicants was conducted on the basis that the losses
of Septic Products are in reality Mr Brookfield's losses.  It was contended on behalf of the applicants
that one award of damages should be given in favour of both applicants.

 

Reliance was placed on behalf of the applicants
on the reasoning of King CJ, with whom the other members of the Full Court of
the Supreme Court of South Australia agreed, in Walker and Others v Hungerfords and Others (1987) 49 SASR 93
at 103.  His Honour there said:-

 

     ""It is now necessary to
consider the effect (if any) upon the loss to the appellants ... of the
incorporation of the business on 1 January 1982 ...  At that date the company took over the assets
and liabilities including the debt to Mutual Acceptance.  The company is a mere trustee of a family
trust whose beneficiaries are the partners of the former business and their
children.  ...  It is clear that the new legal structure made
no practical difference to the conduct of the business or the distribution of
its profits.""

 

As Mr Besanko QC, who appeared with Mr
Robertson for the respondent, pointed out, it is not clear that the High Court
is supportive of the above approach (see Hungerfords
and Others v Walker and Others (1989) 171 CLR 125 per Mason CJ and
Wilson J at 151 and per Dawson J at 165). 
In any event, the evidence in this case does not establish that the
transfer on 1 July 1991 of the assets and liabilities of the business of
Brookfield Plumbing Services to Septic Products ""made no practical difference to the conduct of the business or
the distribution of profits"". 
Indeed it would seem unlikely that this could have been so:  Mr Brookfield alone owned the business
name Brookfield Plumbing Services whereas he is only one of two shareholders
and directors 
of Septic Products.  Ms Nadia Sears, at one
time Mr Brookfield's defacto wife, is also a director and shareholder of
Septic Products.

 

The point of principle here raised was
considered by the Court of Appeal in Prudential
Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd and Others (No.2) [1982] 1 Ch
204.  Their Lordships stated at 210:-

 

     ""A derivative action is
an exception to the elementary principle that A cannot, as a general rule,
bring an action against B to recover damages or secure other relief on behalf
of C for an injury done by B to C.  C is
the proper plaintiff because C is the party injured, and, therefore, the person
in whom the cause of action is vested.""

 

 

At 222-223 their Lordships went on:-

 

     ""But what he [a
shareholder] cannot do is to recover damages merely because the company in
which he is interested has suffered damage. 
He cannot recover a sum equal to the diminution in the market value of
his shares, or equal to the likely diminution in dividend, because such a
""loss"" is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the
company.  The shareholder does not suffer
any personal loss.  His only
""loss"" is through the company, in the diminution in the value of the
net assets of the company, in which he has (say) a 3 per cent shareholding.""

 

 

Prudential
Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd and Others (No.2)
was expressly approved in Gould and
Another v Vaggelas and Others (1985) 157 CLR 215 per Gibbs CJ at 219-220,
Wilson J at 245 and Brennan J at 253. 
See also Morwood and Another
v Chemdata Pty Limited (unreported, Federal Court, Lockhart J,
1 September 1995).

 

I do not consider it appropriate in the
circumstances of this case to make any award of damages in favour of Mr
Brookfield solely on the basis that Septic Products, a company in which he
admittedly has a major interest, has suffered damage.  Although it would, in my view, in any event
be inappropriate to do so, the circumstance that Septic Products is in
liquidation with unpaid creditors would make any such award particularly
inappropriate.  In the circumstance that
no loss or damage suffered by Mr Brookfield directly has been established,
the application by him, so far as it makes claims against the respondent
independently of the deed of 28 October 1993, must fail.

 

 

CAN
AN ASSIGNEE RECOVER DAMAGES PURSUANT TO S82 OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT?

 

In the circumstances that:-

 

     (a)  it
has not been established that Mr Brookfield himself suffered loss or damage by
reason of any conduct of the respondent; and

 

     (b)  Septic
Products is joined as an applicant in these proceedings to satisfy the
procedural requirement that the equitable assignor be a party to proceedings
brought in the name of an equitable assignee

 

any award of damages in this case must flow
from Mr Brookfield's rights pursuant to the deed of 28 October 1993.

 

Section 82(1) of the Trade Practices Act
provides as follows:-

 

     ""A person who suffers
loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of
Part IV or V may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action
against the other person or against any person involved in the
contravention.""

 

 

Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act is to be
found in Part V of the Trade Practices Act. 
An action for damages arising out of conduct undertaken in contravention
of s52 is an action brought in reliance on s82.

 

In Park
& Others v Allied Mortgage Corporation Limited & Others (1993) ATPR
46-105 at 53,469 Davie J stated as follows:-

 

     ""In my opinion, a right
to claim damages under ss82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is, in
general, a bare right of action which cannot be assigned.  I am not speaking of an assignment such as
may occur on the bankruptcy or death of a person or on the merger of a company
into another entity.  Absent such special
circumstances, a right to claim under ss82 and 87 cannot, in my opinion, be
assigned ... [Section 82] does not allow for the award of damages in respect of
a loss which was not suffered by any party to the proceedings.  Both the terms of the statutory provision and
the principle as enunciated in cases such as Dawson v Great Northern & City
Railway Co. [1905] 1 KB 260 at 270-1, Defries v Milne [1913] 1 Ch 98 and
Poulton v The Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602 preclude Mrs Regan from
suing for damages in respect of any loss suffered by Mr and Mrs Park.  Mr and Mrs Park have discontinued their
claims and that is an end to them.""

 

 

It is not clear whether in that case Mr and Mrs
Park remained formal parties to the proceedings as the assignors under the
assignment to Mrs Regan.  I do not
understand such fact to be of any significance to his Honour's reasoning.




In Allstate
Life Insurance Co & Ors v Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Limited
& Ors (unreported, Federal Court, Beaumont J, 7 November 1994)
Beaumont J expressed the view that the contrary to the views of Davies J set
out above ""is not reasonably
arguable"".  He concluded:-

 

     ""... that it is clear
beyond argument that ... claims in tort for fraud and the analogous claims
under Part V of the Trade Practices Act are incapable of assignment under
Australian law.""

 

 

The claims which his Honour there regarded as
analogous to claims in tort for fraud were claims pursuant to ss52 and 82 of
the Trade Practices Act.

 

In National
Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd & Ors v Citibank Savings
Limited & Ors (No.1) (unreported, Federal Court, Lindgren J, 1 November
1995) Lindgren J in considering claims pursuant to ss52 and 82 of the Trade
Practices Act and ss68E and 68F of the Securities Industry Code (Vic) concluded
as follows:-

 

     ""The causes of action
under the TP Act [Trade Practices Act] and the SIC [Securities Industry Code]
are not assignable, if for no other reason, because it is relevantly only the
Claimants who could possibly satisfy the statutory descriptions of being
persons who suffer loss or damage caused by the conduct described in the
statutes ...""

 

In Re
Nguyen; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1992) 35 FCR 320
French J granted leave to the Official Trustee to assign to the bankrupt a
cause of action against the National Australia Bank which included allegations
of misleading and 
deceptive conduct contrary to the provisions of s52 of the Trade Practices
Act.  His Honour concluded that the power
of sale by ss134 and 135 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) included a power to
sell to the bankrupt.  As the proposed
assignee was the person who had allegedly suffered loss and damage as a
consequence of the conduct sought to be characterised as misleading and
deceptive, the issue of whether, on its proper construction, s82 of the Trade
Practices Act allows recovery by an assignee who has not himself or herself
suffered loss or damage was not required to be considered by his Honour.

 

Bainton J of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales in Cotterill v Bank of
Singapore (Australia) Ltd & Ors (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW,
Bainton J, decision of 7 July 1995) recognised the validity of an assignment by
the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy of a chose in action for damages pursuant to
ss52 and 82 of the Trade Practices Act. 
Like French J in Re Nguyen;
Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, his Honour placed reliance on
ss134 and 135 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). 
It would appear that no argument was put to his Honour on the question
of whether, on its proper construction, s82 of the Trade Practices Act allows
recovery by an assignee who has not himself or herself suffered loss or
damage.  The issue was not considered by
him.

 

This Court has consistently expressed the view
that on its proper construction, s82 of the Trade Practices Act does not allow
recovery by an assignee who has not himself or herself suffered the loss or
damage sought to be recovered.  Even were
I to hold a different view from that expressed by other members of the Court in
the cases to which I have referred, it would not be appropriate for me, sitting
as a single judge, to decline to follow the earlier decisions of the
Court.  They are not affected by any
obvious error.  On this question of the
proper construction of s82 of the Trade Practices Act, s477(2)(c) of the
Corporations Law, which is discussed below, can, in my view, have no bearing.

 

In my opinion, the claim for damages made
pursuant to ss52 and 82 of the Trade Practices Act must fail.  Consequently no practical purpose would, in
my view, be served by a declaration that the respondent had engaged in conduct
which constitutes a contravention of s52 of the Trade Practices Act.  The granting of declaratory relief is a
discretionary matter.  In the
circumstances of this case I do not consider it appropriate to give further
consideration to the claim for a declaration that the respondent engaged in
conduct which constitutes a contravention of s52 of the Trade Practices Act.

 

 

THE
CLAIM MADE IN RELIANCE ON SECTION 71 OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT

 

As it was not sought to be contended on behalf
of the applicants that they were, or either of them was, a consumer within the
meaning of s71 of the Trade Practices Act, the claims made in reliance on s71
of the Trade Practices Act must fail.

CAN A BARE RIGHT OF ACTION BE ASSIGNED?

 

The general principles of the law of
maintenance and champerty are stated in Halsbury's
Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, Sydney, 1974) Vol 9 at para 400
as follows:-

 

     ""Maintenance may be
defined as the giving of assistance or encouragement to one of the parties to
litigation by a person who has neither an interest in the litigation nor any
other motive recognised by the law as justifying his interference.  Champerty is a particular kind of
maintenance, namely maintenance of an action in consideration of a promise to
give the maintainer a share in the proceeds or subject matter of the
action.""

 

It is the above principles which form the basis
of legal restrictions upon the power of parties to assign certain kinds of
choses in action.

 

In Poulton
v The Commonwealth and Others (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602 the High Court
recognised as ""well
established"" the principle that a right of action for a tort is ""incapable of assignment either at law
or in equity"".  It is thus
appropriate to start from the prima facie
position that the tortious cause of action here relied upon by the applicants,
namely negligent misstatement, is incapable of assignment.

 

Nonetheless, there is a growing body of
authority in Australia indicating acceptance of the approach taken by the House
of Lords in Trendtex Trading Corporation
and Another v Credit Suisse  [1982]
AC 679.  The factual circumstances of
this case are complicated.  For present
purposes they may be summarised, by reference to the head-note of the report,
as follows.  Trendtex Trading Corporation
(""Trendtex"") claimed
damages from a Nigerian Bank (""C.B.N."")
following its failure to honour a letter of credit issued by it.  Credit Suisse was a substantial creditor of
Trendtex and it had guaranteed the legal costs and fees incurred by Trendtex's
solicitors in the action against C.B.N. 
Trendtex purported to assign to Credit Suisse its cause of action
against C.B.N. by way of security. 
Thereafter on 4 January 1978 an agreement between Trendtex and Credit
Suisse was signed which recited that an offer had been received from a third
party to buy Trendtex's right of action against C.B.N. and provided for
Trendtex, amongst other things, to release to Credit Suisse all its residual
rights against C.B.N. and to give a power of attorney to Credit Suisse to enable
the action to be settled.  Following the
settlement of the action against C.B.N. for a large sum, proceedings were
commenced in the name of Trendtex claiming that the agreement of 4 January 1978
was void as contrary to public policy and offending against the laws of
champerty and maintenance.

 

In the House of Lords Lord Wilberforce stated
at 694 as follows:-

 

     ""If no party had been
involved in the agreement of January 4, 1978, but Trendtex and Credit
Suisse, I think that it would have been difficult to contend that the
agreement, even if it involved (as I think it did) an assignment of Trendtex's
residual interest in the C.B.N. case, offended against the law of maintenance
or champerty.  As I have already shown,
Credit Suisse had a genuine and substantial interest in the success of the
C.B.N. litigation.  It had, and I do not
think that the legitimacy of its action was challenged, guaranteed the previous
costs.  It had ... taken a security
interest in the litigation or its proceeds. 
To carry this a stage further by a surrender of Trendtex's residual
interest ... would, in my view, have been lawful, though a question might have
arisen (and indeed may arise) whether, after Credit Suisse had been satisfied
as creditors, Trendtex could claim the return to it of any surplus.""

 

In the same case Lord Roskill said at 703:-

     ""My Lords, I am afraid
that, with respect, I cannot agree with the learned Master of the Rolls [1980]
QB 629,657 when he said in the instant case that ""The old saying that you
cannot assign a 'bare right to litigate' is gone.""  I venture to think that still remains a
fundamental principle of our law.  But it
is today true to say that in English law an assignee who can show that he has a
genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another and to
that extent takes an assignment of that claim to himself is entitled to enforce
that assignment unless by the terms of that assignment he falls foul of our law
of champerty, which, as has often been said, is a branch of our law of maintenance.  For my part I can see no reason in English
law why Credit Suisse should not have taken an assignment to themselves of
Trendtex's claim against C.B.N. for the purpose of recouping themselves for
their own substantial losses arising out of C.B.N.'s repudiation of the letter
of credit upon which Credit Suisse were relying to refinance their financing of
the purchases of Trendtex of this amount from their German suppliers.

 

     ... The court should look at
the totality of the transaction.  If the
assignment is of a property right or interest and the cause of action is
ancillary to that right or interest, or if the assignee had a genuine commercial
interest in taking the assignment and in enforcing it for his own benefit, I
see no reason why the assignment should be struck down as an assignment of a
bare cause of action or as savouring of maintenance.""

 

 

The other three members of the House of Lords
indicated agreement with both Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill.

 

It may be noted that each of Lord Wilberforce
and Lord Roskill considered the possibility of an assignee obtaining as a
consequence of the assignment benefits exceeding the value of its ""genuine commercial interest""
in the litigation.  Lord Wilberforce
raised the question, but did not answer it, of 
whether the assignee would be required to return to the assignor any
surplus.  He indicated, however, that the
fact that a surplus could be obtained would not, of itself, invalidate the
assignment.  Lord Roskill, on the other
hand at 703, spoke of the validity of a assignment where ""... an assignee who can show that he has a genuine commercial
interest in the enforcement of the claim of another and to that extent
takes an assignment ..."" (emphasis added)  It does not appear that the other members of
the House of Lords considered there to be any divergence in the approaches of
Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill on this issue as each of them indicated
agreement with them both.

 

In Re
Timothy's Pty Ltd and the Companies Act [1981] 2 NSWLR 706 Needham J
accepted the authority in Australia of the Trendtex
Case.  At 711-712 his Honour, after
referring to the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal and to the speeches
of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in the House of Lords, said:-

     ""It seems, therefore,
that the question which has to be answered, where an assignment of a right of
action for damages is in question, is whether the assignee has ""a genuine
and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation ...

 

     ... it seems to me that the
principle of the Trendtex case can be applied to an assignment of a right of action by a debtor to a
creditor where the evidence shows that, without that assignment, the creditor
is not likely to be paid his debt.  In
such a case the rule of public policy would be inapplicable because the
assignment would not be champertous.""

 

Although ultimately Heerey J in Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank
Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 did not need to place reliance on the decision of the
House of Lords in the Trendtex Case
he also recognised that case as reflecting ""the
modern law"".  The learned
authors of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane in Equity: Doctrine & Remedies (3rd
ed, Butterworths, Sydney, 1992) take the same view (see para 694).

 

The Trendtex
Case did not involve the assignment of a cause of action in tort.  The speeches of their Lordships do not,
however, suggest that any distinction between contractual and tortious causes
of action was material to their reasoning. 
It may be noted that in Three
Rivers District Council and Others v Bank of England the Court of Appeal
apparently accepted without question the assignment of a cause of action for
misfeasance in public office, a tortious claim.

 

In Monk v
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 at 152
Cohen J agreed that there was no logic in making a distinction between a cause
of action in contract and one in tort for the purpose of applying the Trendtex test.  Having found, however, that the assignment
there under consideration in any event failed the Trendtex test, he was not required to read a conclusion on whether
logic and the Australian law were in accord on this issue.

 

The issue did arise for determination by the
High Court of New Zealand in First
City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710.  Gault J at 757 concluded as follows:-

     ""The original
justification for the blanket rule preventing assignment of rights to sue in
tort was that the law does not give effect to arrangements savouring of
champerty.  The same considerations apply
to the assignment of causes of action in contract.  Therefore it seems logical that the test
should be the same whether in contract or in tort; ie does the assignee have a
legitimate commercial interest in taking the assignment of the cause of
action?""

 

 

His Honour there upheld an assignment of a
right of action in tort which was ancillary to an assigned debenture and was
capable of protecting the value of that security:  the assignee was found to have a genuine
commercial interest in the action.

 

In South
Australian Management Corporation v Sheahan & Ors (1994) 16 ACSR 45
Debelle J accepted the authority in Australia of the Trendtex Case.  At 57-58 his
Honour said:-

 

     ""The decision in
Trendtex has the effect of qualifying
substantially the principle that it is not possible to assign a bare right to
sue for unliquidated damages for breach of contract.  There seems to be no reason in logic or as a
matter of public policy, why it should not also be possible to assign the bare
right to sue for unliquidated damages in tort where the cause of action is not
for a personal tort such as damages for personal injury, defamation, or false
imprisonment ...

 

     ... I conclude that provided
the action is not of a personal nature and that the assignee has a genuine
commercial interest, both an action for unliquidated damages in tort and an
action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract are capable of
assignment and the assignment will not be contrary to public policy.""

 

 

Smith J also took the approach in Beatty & Anor v Brash Pty Ltd (1995)
13 ACLC 925 that the weight of authority now supports a more liberal approach
than that reflected in Poulton v The
Commonwealth & Ors.

 

By contrast, Beaumont J in Allstate Life Insurance Co & Ors v Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group limited & Ors stated that it ""... is settled law in Australia that a right to litigate a claim
in tort is incapable of assignment at law or in equity ...""  His Honour referred to the development
of the law in England in the context of the assignment of contractual causes of
action and expressed the view that Australian law was likely to move in the
same direction so far as claims in contract are concerned.  He referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview
Nominees Ltd and noted that, even were he free to depart from the High
Court's statement of the position in Poulton
v The Commonwealth, the assignment before him could not be characterised as
one calculated to protect property.

 

In National
Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd & Ors v Citibank Savings
Limited & Ors (No.1) Lindgren J noted that he had not been referred to
any Australian case in which an assignment of a tortious cause of action had
been held valid by reference to the Trendtex
test.  The decision of Smith J in Beatty & Anor v Brash Pty Ltd was
handed down after the conclusion of argument in the National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd Case.   I note, however, that the decision of
Debelle J in South Australian Management
Corporation v Sheahan & Ors was delivered shortly before the National Mutual Property Services
(Australia) Pty Ltd Case was argued. 
Lindgren J, like Beaumont J in the Allstate Life Insurance Co Case, queried whether he was free to
depart from the High Court's statement of the position in Poulton v The Commonwealth, but, again like 
Beaumont J in the Allstate Life Insurance
Co Case found it unnecessary to express a final view on this issue.  Lindgren J found that the causes of action in
the case before him did not satisfy the Trendtex
test.

 

It is submitted on behalf of the respondent
that I am bound by the statement of the High Court referred to above in Poulton v The Commonwealth.  The statement does not strictly form part of
the ratio decidendi of the High Court
in Poulton v The Commonwealth.  Nonetheless, it is a clear statement by the
High Court of what it described as ""well-established
principle"".  It is not clear
that the developments described above are sufficient to free me, particularly
sitting as a single judge, to conclude that such principle is now in Australia
to be treated as disestablished (see Trident
General Insurance Co Limited v McNiece Bros Proprietary Limited (1988)
165 CLR 107 per Brennan J at 129-130).

 

Nor, in my view, is it clear that an interest
as a shareholder is the kind of ""genuine
commercial interest"" of which the House of Lords spoke in the Trendtex Case.  No argument was addressed to me on this
question and I say nothing further about it.

 

I am relieved of the necessity to reach a
conclusion on the above issues by the conclusions reached by me as to the
proper interpretation of s477(2)(c) of the Corporations Law which is discussed
below.

However, before turning to s477(2)(c) of the
Corporations Law, I note that Mr Brookfield has a 50% shareholding in Septic
Products.  The other shareholder,
Ms Sears, gave evidence on the hearing of this matter but before the
existence of the deed of 28 October 1993 was disclosed.  Understandably, she did not give evidence
which explained her absence as a joint equitable assignee with Mr Brookfield of
the choses in action referred to in the pleadings.  An affidavit sworn by her and read on the
application by Mr Brookfield for leave to use the name Septic Products as
a co-applicant was not sought to be tendered on the hearing.  Although there was some suggestion during
argument that Mr Brookfield is a creditor of Septic Products, this was not, in
my view, established on the evidence.  It
was submitted on behalf of the applicants that Mr Brookfield was ""... a person who in the ordinary
course of commerce the court could, in the exercise of judicial notice, expect
to have given directors (sic) guarantees to creditors of [Septic
Products]"".  In my view, if Mr
Brookfield wished to rely on any guarantee which may have been given by him of
the debts of Septic Products to support the validity of the deed of assignment
of 28 October 1993, it was incumbent on him to prove such guarantee by
evidence.  This is not a topic for
judicial notice.  In the circumstances it
may well be arguable that Mr Brookfield has sought by the assignment to
take the benefit of the choses in action there referred to beyond the extent of
his proven genuine commercial interest in such choses in action.  The significance of any such an argument is
not something which I am required in the circumstances to determine.

 

SECTION 477(2)(c) OF THE CORPORATIONS LAW

 

Section 477(2)(c) of the Corporations Law gives
a liquidator power to ""sell or
otherwise dispose of, in any manner, all or any part of the property of the
company"".  Section 9 of the
Corporations Law provides that, unless the contrary intention appears, ""'property' means any legal or equitable estate or interest (whether present or
future and whether vested or contingent) in real or personal property of any
description and includes a thing in action"".

 

It is contended on behalf of the applicants
that the deed of 28 October 1993 constitutes a sale by the liquidator of
Septic Products of property of the company. 
It is further contended that s477(2)(c) authorises the assignment of a
chose in action which could not be assigned at common law.

 

In Ramsey
v Hartley and Others (1977) 1 WLR 686 the Court of Appeal held that the
statutory power of a trustee in bankruptcy to sell any part of the bankrupt's
property vested in him or her gave the trustee the right to assign a chose in
action in tort to the bankrupt.  In
holding that the assignment was not invalid the Court of Appeal relied upon the
decision of Chitty J in Guy
v Churchill (1888) 40 Ch.D 481. 
In that case Chitty J accepted the decision of the Court of Appeal in Seear v Lawson (1880) 15 Ch.D 426.

 

In Seear
v Lawson a trustee in bankruptcy of a person who had conveyed away real
property absolutely, commenced an action 
against the grantee to have it declared that the conveyance was a mortgage
only.  Following the issue of the writ
the trustee sold and assigned the subject matter of the action to a purchaser
for value.  The validity of the
assignment of the chose in action was challenged.  Jessel MR at 432-433 stated:-

     ""Now the word
""property"", as defined by the 4th section of the
Bankruptcy Act, includes things in
action.  The trustee obtains the
bankrupt's property under the 17th section on his appointment.  The words are, ""on the appointment of a
trustee the property shall forthwith pass to and vest in the trustee
appointed,"" and he gets the property in no other way.

 

     The first question to be
decided is, does he get such a right of action as this under the 17th
section?  I should say it is quite clear
that he does.  It would be impossible to
hold that it remained vested in the bankrupt so that he could after his
discharge recover the estate for his own benefit.  Therefore, under the word
""property"", it vests in the trustee and is now in the trustee.  It is in the trustee by a statutory transfer,
and for this purpose I assume that such a right could not have been transferred
apart from the statute.  Then the 25th
section enables the trustee ""to sell all of the property of the bankrupt
including"", &c.  It is suggested
that the word ""property"" in the 25th section is to have a different
meaning from that which it has in the 17th section.  I cannot see why.  It is the same word and under the same
definition clause.  If the trustee gets a
right of action, why is he not to realize it? 
The proper office of the trustee is to realize the property for the sake
of distributing the proceeds amongst the creditors.  Why should we hold as a matter of policy that
it is necessary for him to sue in his own name? 
He may have no funds, or he may be disinclined to run the risk of having
to pay costs, or he may consider it undesirable to delay the winding-up of the
bankruptcy till the end of the litigation. 
Considering these things, it seems to me to à
priori probable that he would be entitled
to sell it, but I prefer to rest my decision upon the plain words of the
statute.  The words are, ""all the
property"", and it does not appear to me that we have any right to exclude
from the plain provision of the 25th section anything which has passed to the
trustee under the 17th section.""

 

French J in Re
Nguyen; Ex parte Official Trustee concluded, after consideration of the
authorities referred to above, that the 
power of sale conferred by ss134 and 135 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)
includes a power to sell a chose in action, including a chose in action for
damages.  Bainton J of the Supreme Court
of New South Wales took the same view in Cotterill
v Bank of Singapore (Australia) Ltd & Ors.

 

In re
Park Gate Waggon Works Company (1881) 17 Ch.D 234 the Court of Appeal held
that the there applicable companies legislation, which authorised a liquidator
to sell the property of a company, which was also defined to include choses in
action, similarly permitted the liquidator to sell choses in action in circumstances
which would otherwise attract the rule against maintenance.  The same view has been taken in England with
respect to modern companies legislation by the Court of Appeal in Bang & Olufsen U.K. Ltd v Ton
Systeme Ltd (unreported, Court of Appeal, 16 July 1993, referred to by
Lightman J in Grovewood Holdings Plc v
James Capel & Co Ltd [1995] Ch 80 at 85) and by Lightman J in Grovewood Holdings Plc v James Capel &
Co Ltd.

 

Section 474(1) of the Corporations Law does not
vest the property of a company being wound up on its liquidator.  It simply requires the liquidator to ""... take into his or her custody or
under his or her control all of the property to which the company appears to be
entitled ...""  Section 474(2)
authorises the Court to direct that all or any part of the property of the
company shall vest in the liquidator.  It
is not suggested in this case that any order pursuant to s474(2) has been made
in respect of all or any of the property of Septic Products.  It therefore 
seems that the appropriate assignor in this case was the company, not the
liquidator.  However, no point was taken
in this regard and I do not think that anything should turn on it.

 

I was not referred to, nor am I aware, of any
Australian cases which are of direct assistance on the issue of construction
which I am presently considering.  The
authorities referred to above are, I consider, of assistance by analogy.

 

I accept the submission made on behalf of the
applicants that the deed of 28 October 1993 constitutes a sale by the
liquidator of Septic Products of property of the company.  Having regard to the authorities referred to
above, I find that such sale was authorised by s477(2)(c) of the Corporations
Law.

 

As a consequence I conclude that the following
choses in action pleaded in these proceedings (assuming that, on the proper
construction of the statement of claim, such choses in action have been pleaded
as part of the cause of action in Septic Products) were validly assigned to
Mr Brookfield by the deed of 28 October 1993:-

 

     (a)  the
chose in action in negligent misrepresentation; and

 

     (b)  the
chose in action for breach of contract.

 

NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION

 

Consideration of this cause of action is
complicated by the lack of clarity with which it is pleaded in the statement of
claim, 
and by the fact that limited attention was paid to it by counsel for the
applicants in both their oral and their written submissions.

 

The first important issue on which the position
of the applicants is unclear, is that of whether the statement of claim is
intended to plead a cause of action in Septic Products in negligent
misrepresentation.  The statement of
claim does not plead the making of representations to Septic Products, nor does
it allege that Septic Products acted in reliance on representations made to Mr
Brookfield.  The better view may well be
that the claim in negligent misrepresentation is only put forward on behalf of
Mr Brookfield.  Nonetheless, I will
consider the case on the basis that such claim is also put forward on behalf of
Septic Products.

 

As is pointed out above, the pleaded breach by
the respondent of its duty of care to the applicants does not correspond to the
pleaded duty.  The duty pleaded is ""... to take care in and about the
making of representations."" 
Instead of pleading as the breach of duty that the respondent failed to
take care in and about the making of the relevant representations and that such
representations were incorrect, the statement of claim by paragraph 41 pleads
that the respondent ""... recklessly
and in breach of its duty of care ... failed to ensure ..."" that the
Doc 3, Doc 7 and the Sumprat pumps had certain capacities.

 




An application to strike out this pleading may
well have succeeded.  However, no such
application was made.  The best that I
can do in the circumstances, I consider, is to treat paragraph 41 of the
statement of claim as containing by inference pleas that the representations
apparently referred to in paragraph 40 of the statement of claim were incorrect
and that the respondent failed to take reasonable care to ensure that they were
correct.

 

As has often been pointed out, there has been
since Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller
& Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 a tendency in the authorities to treat
liability for negligent misstatement as involving special complications (see,
for example, San Sebastian Proprietary
Limited & Anor v The Minister (1986) 162 CLR 340 per Gibbs CJ, Mason,
Wilson & Dawson JJ at 353-358). 
Nonetheless, recent High Court authorities establish that in this area
of the law of negligence, as in all such areas, a duty of care arises under the
common law of negligence in Australia only where there exists a relationship of
proximity between the parties with respect to both the relevant class of act or
omission and the relevant kind of damage (Bryan
v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609 esp. per Mason CJ, Deane & Gaudron JJ
at 617; San Sebastian Proprietary Limited
& Anor v The Minister per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson & Dawson JJ at
354-355).  The majority of the
High Court pointed out in the San
Sebastian Case at 355:-

 

     ""When ... economic loss
results from negligent misstatement, the element of reliance plays a prominent
part in the ascertainment of a relationship of proximity between the plaintiff
and the defendant, and therefore in the ascertainment of a duty of care.""

 

I turn to consider the claim of negligent
misrepresentation as to first, the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps, and secondly, as to
the Sumprat pumps.

 

As to the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps, the applicants
have pleaded that as a result of representations made by the respondent in
October 1990, Mr Brookfield started, in the case of the Doc 3 pumps, and
continued, in the case of the Doc 7 pumps, to incorporate them in the Parco
Beaver system.

 

No where in the statement of claim is it
pleaded that Septic Products relied upon, or indeed, took any action as a
result of, representations made to Mr Brookfield in October 1990.  Having regard to the evidence in this case
this is not a surprising omission. 
Septic Products was not incorporated until 14 December 1990.  The earliest involvement of Septic Products
with the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps presumably arose in about March 1991.  At that time an informal joint venture, the
terms of which are not in evidence, was entered into between Mr Brookfield,
trading as Brookfield Plumbing Services, and Septic Products.  Subsequently Septic Products effectively took
over the business of Brookfield Plumbing Services.  Assets and liabilities of the Brookfield
Plumbing Services business were transferred to Septic Products effective from
1 July 1991.

 

On the applicants' case, serious problems with
the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps were being experienced by Mr Brookfield by
January and February 1991.  Indeed, on
the applicants' case, in February 1991 Mr Wilsdon told Mr Brookfield that
the Davey Doc pumps were to be taken off the market for the time being because
of problems with them.

 

Moreover, it seems that an agreement must have
been reached between Mr Brookfield and Septic Products as to the net value of
the assets of Brookfield Plumbing Services business transferred to Septic
Products as from 1 July 1991.  The net
value of such assets was recorded in the books of Septic Products as a loan to
it by Mr Brookfield.  No evidence was
lead as to the basis upon which such agreement was reached.  However, it may be presumed to have been
reached in the knowledge of the problems being experienced by Mr Brookfield
trading as Brookfield Plumbing Services with pumps supplied by the respondent.

 

In my view, it cannot sensibly be suggested on
behalf of the applicants that any representations made by the respondent to
Mr Brookfield in October 1990 concerning the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps were
relied upon by Septic Products, or were influential on Septic Products in any
relevant way so far as its conduct of its waste water business was
concerned.  In my view, the applicants
have failed to establish the necessary relationship of proximity between Septic
Products and the respondent to support the pleaded duty of care.  If I am wrong in this, I conclude that the
applicants' claim must in any event fail on the basis that no loss has been
shown to have been suffered by Septic Products as a consequence of any
representations made by the respondent.

 

Although the issue referred to above makes it
strictly unnecessary to do so, I point out that, in any event, the evidence as
to the Doc 7 pumps falls short of establishing that in October 1990 Mr
Brookfield himself placed reliance on the respondent in respect of the Doc 7
pump or that he acted in reliance on any representations made by the respondent
in October 1990 as to the Doc 7 pump.

 

Mr Brookfield's evidence as to the Doc 7 pump
was as follows.  He had used such pumps
from approximately July 1989:  that is,
from well before his first dealings with the respondent.  They were provided to him with the Parco
Beaver systems he purchased from Allwater. 
He had witnessed extensive testing of Doc 7 pumps by Allwater, in
conjunction with the respondent, in about 1989. 
He was apparently aware of the results of such testing.  After Allwater went into liquidation he
approached the respondent as an alternative supplier of Doc 7 pumps:  they were pumps which he wished to continue
to use.

 

The evidence of Mr Brookfield thus does not
support the plea in paragraph 20.6 of the statement of claim that it ""... was as a result of the
representations made by Davey through its servant or agent, Wilsdon, to
Brookfield in October 1990 that Brookfield continued to incorporate the Doc 7
pump into the irrigation tank of the Parco Beaver System.""

 

In my opinion, if a claim in negligent
misrepresentation is intended by the statement of claim to be made on behalf of
Septic Products, such claim must fail so far as it relates to the Doc 3 and Doc
7 pumps.

 

I turn to consider the plea of negligent
misrepresentation so far as the Sumprat pumps are concerned.  Paragraphs 26 and 27 of the statement of
claim are in the following terms:-

 

     ""26.In discussions which occurred between
Brookfield and Wayne Smallacombe of Davey, in a face to face conversation in
approximately early 1992 Smallacombe, on behalf of Davey, told Brookfield that
there was a manufacturing fault with the Doc 3 pumps and that they would supply
an alternative pump called a Sumprat as a suitable replacement for the Doc 3 pump
(the Sumprat pump).

 

 

      27.Brookfield
thereafter commenced incorporating the Sumprat pump in substitution for the Doc
3 pump in the Parco Beaver System.""

 

 

The evidence in this case makes it plain that
the discussion alleged in paragraph 26 could not have taken place in early
1992.  Septic Products ceased to purchase
pumps from the respondent in October 1991. 
The first Sumprat pump was supplied to Mr Brookfield by the respondent
in February 1991 and the last in early March 1991.  The case of the applicants is that problems
were experienced by Mr Brookfield with Sumprat pumps almost as soon as they
were supplied to him, and that such problems were identical with the problems
experienced with the Doc 3 pumps.

 

Even if other difficulties involved in the purported
pleading of the cause of action in Septic Products in negligent
misrepresentation could be overlooked, the cause of action must, in my view,
fail.  There is no plea, and the evidence
falls short 
of establishing, that Septic Products relied on the accuracy of the
representations made to Mr Brookfield concerning the Sumprat pumps.  Moreover, no Sumprat pumps were ever supplied
by the respondent to Septic Products, and it seems highly unlikely on the
evidence that Septic Products came into possession of any Sumprat pumps
supplied by the respondent to Mr Brookfield trading as Brookfield Plumbing
Services.  Invoices placed in evidence on
behalf of the respondent show that 46 Sumprat pumps were invoiced by the respondent
to Brookfield Plumbing Services:  they
were delivered between 1 February - 8 March 1991.

 

In my opinion, if a claim in negligent
misrepresentation is intended by the statement of claim to be made on behalf of
Septic Products, such claim must also fail so far as it relates to the Sumprat
pumps.

 

 

BREACH OF CONTRACT

 

It is necessary to consider as a preliminary
issue the nature of the contract or contracts between first Mr Brookfield, and
subsequently Septic Products, on the one hand and the respondent on the other.

 

Following initial discussions between Mr
Brookfield and Mr Wilsdon, Mr Brookfield completed a credit account
application directed to the respondent. This application bears the date
4 October 1990.  By such application
Mr Brookfield, trading as Brookfield Plumbing Services, acknowledged and agreed
to comply 
with the respondent's trading terms of ""...
net cash 30 days after the month of invoice.""  He also acknowledged the right of the
respondent to withdraw credit facilities ""...
at any time without prior notice"". 
The credit account application was approved by the respondent and, upon
orders being placed for them, pumps were subsequently supplied by the
respondent to Mr Brookfield, and subsequently Septic Products, on the
respondent's usual trading terms.

 

Although the statement of claim is drafted in
terms of a contract for the sale and purchase of Doc 3 pumps, and similarly a
contract for the sale of Doc 7 pumps, and another contract for the sale of
Sumprat pumps, I do not consider that the evidence supports the existence of
three such contracts.  The parties agreed
a basis upon which the respondent would provide credit facilities to Mr
Brookfield should he place orders with it for pumps - albeit that the
respondent retained the right unilaterally to withdraw such credit facilities.  However, I consider that separate contracts
for the purchase and supply of pumps arose upon the placing and acceptance of
each individual order for pumps. 
Initially such orders were placed by Mr Brookfield, or with his
authority, on his own behalf, giving rise, when such orders were accepted, to
contracts between Mr Brookfield and the respondent.  Subsequently such orders were placed by
Mr Brookfield, or with his authority, on behalf of Septic Products, giving
rise, when such orders were accepted, to contracts between Septic Products and
the respondent.

 

I note that all invoices raised by the
respondent in relation to the supply of pumps to the applicants show Brookfield
Plumbing Services as the purchaser.  It
was not suggested that the respondent was unaware of Septic Products having
taken over the business earlier run by Mr Brookfield on his own behalf.  It seems clear that the respondent accepted
payments made to it by Septic Products. 
Nothing turns, in my view, on the fact that the respondent provided to
Septic Products invoices which gave the name of the purchaser as ""Brookfield Plumbing Services"".

 

The evidence does not make clear whether Septic
Products became the purchasing party for the pumps from about March 1991, when
the informal joint venture agreement was entered into between
Mr Brookfield and Septic Products, or only from 1 July 1991, when
Septic Products purchased from Mr Brookfield assets and liabilities relating to
the Brookfield Plumbing Services business. 
Under cross-examination Mr Brookfield agreed that after the date of the
joint venture agreement, Septic Products ""conducted
the business"".  It seems fair to
assume from this answer that Septic Products became the purchaser of pumps from
the respondent from a date in March 1991. 
The precise date is not in evidence. 
I shall assume a date in mid-March 1991. 
No pumps were invoiced by the respondent to Brookfield Plumbing Services
between 12 March and 18 April 1991.

 

The respondent has placed in evidence a
compilation of invoices for the supply of pumps and statements rendered by the
respondent to Brookfield Plumbing Services. 
I accept that this compilation is complete.  The invoices bear dates which range from 24
October 1990 to 16 August 1991.  In
addition there is an invoice dated 13 January 1992 which records a credit
in favour of Brookfield Plumbing Services of $480.02 as a consequence of a
warranty claim in respect of two Doc 7 pumps. 
The statements are dated the last day of each of the months from October
1990 to June 1992 inclusive.  They
demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the invoices referred to above.

 

Such invoices show that between mid-March 1991
and August 1991 Septic Products placed 9 orders with the respondent for the
supply of pumps.  Pursuant to such orders
70 Doc 3 pumps and 71 Doc 7 pumps were supplied.  No orders were placed by Septic Products for
Sumprat pumps and none was supplied to it. 
Over the same period the respondent delivered to Septic Products a
further 1 Doc 3 pump and 5 Doc 7 pumps pursuant to warranty claims.  The invoices also record that on 16 August
1991 Septic Products received credit for 3 Doc 3 pumps which had been invoiced
on 19 June 1991.

 

The terms of s14 of the Sale of Goods Act are
set out in full above.  The first proviso
to the general position established by the section of no implied warranty as to
the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a
contract of sale is that:-

 

     ""I   Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the
seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show
that the buyer relies
on the seller's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the 
seller's business to supply ... there is an implied condition that the goods
shall be reasonably fit for such purpose: 
Provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified
article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as
to its fitness for any particular purpose ...""

 

 

As to both the Doc 3 and the Doc 7 pumps, it is
accepted that they are goods of a description which it was, at the relevant
time, the respondent's business to supply.

 

Were the contracts between Septic Products and
the respondent for the sale of Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps, contracts for the sale of
a specified article under its patent or other trade name?

 

As to the Doc 7 pump, Mr Brookfield's affidavit
evidence contains the following paragraphs:-

 

     ""151.     I telephoned
Daveys South Australian office on or about 3rd October 1990.

 

      152.     I had a phone conversation with Dallas
Wilsdon, who was the South Australian manager for Davey Products.

 

      153.     I cannot recall the actual words in the
discussion however it was to the following effect.

 

      154.     I said words to the effect of:

 

                   ""I am Ian Brookfield.  I run a waste water treatment business here
in Adelaide.  I sell the system called
the Parco Beaver system which currently uses one of your pumps on the
irrigation system"".

 

      155.     Wilsdon said words to the effect of:

 

                   ""I'm aware that in New South Wales Davey is
supplying Allwater Treatment with Doc 7's"".

 

 

 

      156.     I said words to the effect of:

 

                   ""Yes but Allwater Treatment is now in
liquidation.  That's the reason for my
phone call to you as I would like to discuss the possibility of us purchasing
the Doc 7's direct from Davey here in Adelaide"".

 

     157.      He said words to
the effect of:

 

                   ""I would be more than happy to discuss it
with you"".""

 

 

Mr Wilsdon agreed that the above paragraphs,
with others not presently relevant, constituted a ""fair recital"" of the conversation in question.  Subsequently Mr Brookfield placed orders with
the respondent for the supply of Doc 7 pumps. 
In my view the resultant contracts for the supply by the respondent to
Mr Brookfield of Doc 7 pumps were contracts ""for
the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name""
within the meaning of the proviso to paragraph I of s14 of the Sale of Goods
Act.  The evidence does not suggest that
the position was different with respect to the contracts between Septic
Products and the respondent for the sale and purchase of Doc 7 pumps.

 

I conclude that the contracts between Septic
Products and the respondent for the sale of Doc 7 pumps included no implied
condition of fitness for any particular purpose.

 

I turn to consider the contracts for the supply
of Doc 3 pumps.  Mr Brookfield's
affidavit evidence was that he initially asked Mr Wilsdon:-

 

 

     ""158.     Have you
anything similar in performance to the Grundfos KP 100"",

 

 

and
received the reply:-

 

 

     ""159.     Lowara does
make a smaller version of the Doc 7 which is called a Doc 3.  We could compare the performance of the two
pumps.""

 

 

At a subsequent meeting between Mr Brookfield
and Mr Wilsdon at the offices of the respondent there was a further
conversation between them on the topic of the Doc 3 pump.  Mr Brookfield's version of this conversation
is set out in his affidavit in the following paragraphs:-

     ""166.     I told him
that I wished to discuss the use of an alternative to the Grundfos KP 100 pump
for the inclusion into my waste water treatment system.

 

      167.     Wilsdon asked words to the effect:

 

                   ""What are you going to use these pumps
for?""

 

      168.     In response, I said words to the effect:

 

                   ""The Grundfos KP 100 pump is used for
recirculating the effluent over the filter pack in the treatment tank which is
operated by a control panel.  This
activates the pump with four starts per hour running the pump for 10 minutes on
and 5 minutes off.  The pump runs 24
hours per day on these cycle times.""

 

              He said:

 

                   ""The Lowara Doc 3 pump could handle four
starts per hour without any problem.""

 

                   ""Davey can offer an alternative to the
Grundfos KP 100 at a more competitive price.""

 

                   ""The Doc 3 pump has almost identical
performance ability to the Grundfos KP 100 pump.""

      169.     He then gave me some Davey Lowara
brochures.

 

      170.     These brochures contained on the fourth
page, performance graphs showing performance statistics which appeared to
verify what he said.

 

      171.     A second brochure contained a chart of
performance characteristics on page 8a.

 

      172.     . . . . . .

 

      173.     I had with me a specification sheet
regarding the Grundfos KP100 pump.  I
showed that to Wilsdon.

 

      174.     . . . . . .

 

      175.     Wilsdon then compared the flow rates of the
Davey Lowara Doc 3 and the Grundfos KP 100, by pointing out to me the published
information regarding the two pumps.

 

      176.     He told me that, based on the written
representations in the brochures ""IWB13"", the Davey Lowara Doc 3
satisfied our requirements.""

 

Mr Brookfield's evidence is that at the close
of the meeting between him and Mr Wilsdon referred to above he agreed to
purchase Doc 3 pumps from the respondent.

 

Mr Wilsdon agreed that in response to a
question from Mr Brookfield about a pump similar in performance to the
Grundfos KP 100 he made reference to the Doc 3 pump and suggested a
comparison of the performance of the two pumps. 
As to the subsequent meeting between him and Mr Brookfield, Mr Wilsdon's
affidavit evidence is as follows:-

 

     ""8.  By reference to the Lowara brochure and a
brochure relating to the Grundfos KP100 I explained to Brookfield the benefits
of the Davey Lowara Doc 3.  I obtained
the Grundfos brochure from Davey's ""competitors library"".  Such benefits included the running costs of
the Doc 3 and a significant price difference. 
At the meeting:

 

          8.1  I superimposed on
the performance curve of the Doc 3 (in the Lowara brochure) the performance
curve of the KP100 (derived for the Grundfos brochure) which illustrated
clearly the superior performance of the Lowara pump.

 

          8.2  I told Brookfield
that the running costs of the Doc 3 would be less than the KP100 because the
Doc 3 only used 1.3 amps of current against 1.9 by the KP100.

 

          8.3  I advised him
that the Doc 3 was capable of an operating head of three to four metres.

 

          8.4  Brookfield asked
whether the Doc 3 was capable of running for a period of 10 minutes and then
being turned off for 5 minutes and then back on for a further 10 minutes and I
confirmed that the Doc 3 was capable of this performance.

 

     9.   Prior to my discussion with Brookfield in October 1990, I had a
very general understanding of the function and operation of septic aerobic
systems from a discussion or discussions at a State Manager's meeting or
meetings where I learned that Davey was, in New South wales, supplying to other
septic system manufacturers.  I believe
those other companies were Envirocycle, Biocycle and Allwater.

 

     10.  I do not recall any conversation, at the meeting with Brookfield,
as to what specifically the recirculation pump would be pumping.  I did say that if the Grundfos KP100 could do
the job then so would the Doc 3.

 

     11.  . . . . . .

 

     12.  At the conclusion of the meeting Brookfield said he wanted 10 Doc 3
pumps straight away.  I explained that I
could not supply Brookfield until his credit application had been approved,
however, I gave him two pumps to take with him.""

 

Shortly after the meeting referred to above, Mr
Wilsdon went at the suggestion of Mr Brookfield to his factory.  There he saw a Parco Beaver system set up for
display purposes.  The display unit
showed the internal working of the second tank of the system including the
positions of the pumps within the tank. 
For display purposes the unit operated with clean water, not with 
septic waste.  The evidence of Mr
Brookfield is that he used the display unit to explain the workings of the
Parco Beaver system to Mr Wilsdon, and that Mr Wilsdon said that the ""... Davey pumps were going to be more
than suitable for the job at hand ..."" and that the Doc 3 pump ""... was suitable for a septic effluent
environment.""

 

The evidence of Mr Wilsdon conflicts to some
degree with that of Mr Brookfield so far as the conversation between them as to
the Doc 3 pump is concerned.  Most
importantly, Mr Wilsdon denies that he asked the question set out in paragraph
167 of Mr Brookfield's affidavit or that Mr Brookfield said what is set
out in paragraph 168 of his affidavit.

 

As to the visit to Mr Brookfield's factory, Mr
Wilsdon agrees that he saw the display version of the Parco beaver system and
that Mr Brookfield gave him a general overview of its workings.  However he denies that there was detailed
discussion as to the technical aspects of the system.  Mr Wilsdon's evidence is that he does not
recall any discussion with Mr Brookfield at that meeting regarding the
performance or suitability of the Doc 3 pumps. 
In his words, ""[t]hose
discussions had previously taken place at the meeting at Davey's premises on 5
October"".  Mr Wilsdon,
however, agrees that he might have said words to the effect that ""... Davey pumps were going to be more
than suitable for the job at hand ..."" based on the fact that the
Grundfos KP 100 was apparently doing the job.  Whilst denying that he told
Mr Brookfield that the Doc 3 was suitable for a septic effluent
environment, he agrees that he might have said ""... something to that effect based on the fact that Davey was
supplying to other septic aerobic system manufacturers.""

 

Mr Brookfield gave evidence that the filter
system in the display unit seen by Mr Wilsdon incorporated as a filter medium
cut plastic piping rather than the disc pack modification developed by him.

 

To the extent that there is conflict between
the evidence of Mr Brookfield and Mr Wilsdon as to the conversations
between them as to the Doc 3 pump, and as to what happened when Mr Wilsdon
visited Mr Brookfield's factory in early October 1990, I prefer the evidence of
Mr Wilsdon.  He was willing, it seemed to
me, both in his affidavit evidence and orally, to make admissions apparently
adverse to the respondent.  He struck me
in the witness box as a frank witness who was seeking to answer questions put
to him to the best of his ability.  Mr
Brookfield has had, of course, a much more personal involvement in the
circumstances out of which this case has arisen.  To some extent, it seems to me, this has
influenced his perception of past events. 
In particular, I conclude that his memory now tends to enhance the
degree of responsibility of others for the problems experienced by him and by
Septic Products.  Moreover there were, I
believe, occasions on which Mr Brookfield sought to tailor his evidence by
withholding certain material, or by giving misleading answers, to avoid what he
perceived to be potential weaknesses in the applicants' case.  I refer, as one example, to
Mr Brookfield's early evidence as to the number of Parco Beaver systems
modified by the incorporation of disc packs which were provided to members of
the public from early 1990.  Another, in
my view, was his evidence as to his intention as at the date of his letter of
16 September 1992 to South West Sydney Public Health Unit.  Yet another, in my view, was his evidence at
the time that counsel for the respondent was seeking to demonstrate inconsistencies
between Schedule ""A"" to the statement of claim and the applicants'
service records.

 

Having regard to the totality of the evidence
as to the circumstances in which Mr Brookfield initially agreed to purchase
from the respondent Doc 3 pumps, I do not consider that it can be fairly
concluded that the initial contracts were for the sale of a specified article
under its patent or other trade name within the meaning of s14 of the Sale of
Goods Act.  For the reasons set out
below, it is not necessary for me to reach a final view on whether later
contracts for the supply of Doc 3 pumps, and in particular contracts to which
Septic products was a party, were such contracts.

 

Did Mr Brookfield make known to the respondent,
through Mr Wilsdon, the particular purpose for which the Doc 3 pumps
were required so as to show that he relied on the respondent's skill and
judgment?  In my view, the evidence set
out above shows that he did.  However,
what was the particular purpose which he made known to the respondent?  In my view, the particular purpose which he
made known was the purpose of acting as a recirculation pump in a Parco Beaver
system.  I find that Mr Brookfield did
not make known to Mr Wilsdon that the Doc 3 was required for the purpose of
acting as a recirculation pump in a Parco Beaver system modified by the
replacement of the cut plastic piping filter medium with a disc pack or in a
BPS system.

 

I am prepared to treat the particular purpose
expressly made known to the respondent so far as the contracts for the sale of
Doc 3 pumps by it to Mr Brookfield were concerned, as having been made known to
the respondent, expressly or by implication, so far as the contracts for the
sale of Doc 3 pumps by it to Septic Products were concerned.

 

Has it been established that the Doc 3 pumps
were not reasonably fit for that purpose?

 

The respondent did not contest that it had
received from its supplier a batch of faulty Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps.  The fault was related to the mounting of the
steel retainer at the bottom of the pump to the plastic bottom bearing housing
immediately above it.  The screws which
fixed the retainer to the bottom bearing housing had split or cracked the
plastic.  As a consequence the screws
would not hold and the retainer could come loose if bumped or forced.  Pumps with this fault were plainly not fit
for use in a waste water system.  The
fault will hereafter be referred to as ""the
bottom bearing housing problem"".

 




The evidence of Mr Wilsdon was that the faulty
batch arrived in Australia in January or February 1991, and one pallet of about
72 pumps, of which 40% had the bottom bearing housing problem, came to
South Australia.  The first 6 pumps
returned to the respondent by Mr Brookfield, according to Mr Wilsdon, came
from this batch.  This evidence was not
challenged and I accept it.  It may be,
of course, that the first pumps returned by Mr Brookfield to the
respondent were not the first with which problems were experienced.

 

It seems fair to assume that pumps from the
faulty batch were not continuing to be supplied by the respondent to its
customers as late as April 1991.  Other
evidence tends to confirm this assumption. 
Mr Brookfield's belief was that the Sumprat pumps were supplied
because the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps (presumably the faulty batch) had been
withdrawn from the market.  The Sumprat
pumps were supplied to Mr Brookfield between 7 February and 8 March
1991.  Mr Wilsdon's evidence was of a
shortage of Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps in February and March 1991:  a shortage presumably caused, at least in
part, by the need to withhold from customers pumps identified as being
faulty.  The inability of the respondent
to supply Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps, for whatever reason, had clearly passed by
mid-March 1991.  Internal memoranda of
the applicant are consistent with pumps with the bottom bearing housing problem
not being supplied by it after February 1991. 
I conclude that pumps supplied by the applicant later than February 1991
did not suffer from the bottom bearing housing problem.  That is, I conclude that none of the Doc 3
pumps supplied to Septic Products pursuant to contracts of sale between it and
the respondent suffered from the bottom bearing housing problem.

 

Nonetheless, it is, I consider, plain on the
evidence that Doc 3 pumps supplied by the respondent to Septic Products failed
in use.  It is not clear how many of them
failed.  Mr Brookfield asserts that all
Doc 3 pumps supplied by the respondent to the applicants failed.  This is denied by the respondent.  Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I
am not able to accept Mr Brookfield's assertion in this regard.

 

The applicants have annexed to the statement of
claim a schedule (""Schedule ""A"""").  Mr Brookfield's affidavit evidence is that
Schedule ""A"" ""... sets out
details of the name of each customer, the location at which a Parco Beaver system
was installed, the date of installation, the date of commission, the types of
pump used in the system, failure dates and causes with details of the services
undertaken and pumps exchanged or replaced insofar as I have been able to
ascertain and verify such information.""  In oral evidence Mr Brookfield agreed that
Schedule ""A"" contained a complete record of customers of the
applicants in South Australia.  He
further agreed that Schedule ""A"" was a complete list of the
applicants' New South Wales customers, except for some customers in the Taree
area, and a complete list of their Queensland customers apart from one
customer.  He stated that Schedule
""A"" did not include all of the applicants' customers in Victoria.

 

As to certain customers whose names are
included in Schedule ""A"", the schedule records that the name of the
recirculation pump is not available.  It
is also the case that certain customer records are not available as to certain
heads of information.  I find that it was
established on behalf of the respondent that certain entries in Schedule
""A"" are erroneous.  However, I
accept it as broadly accurate so far as it goes.

 

Mr Brookfield gave evidence that considerably
more pumps had been replaced than Schedule ""A"" indicates.  He was not, however, able to produce business
records evidencing further replacements, and a video said by him to contain
evidence of additional pump failures was not placed in evidence.  Mr Brookfield's evidence was that initially
he kept poor records of his dealings with the respondent but that later in the
history of their dealings his record keeping improved.  He gave evidence that in about June or July
1991 he had a conversation with an employee of the respondent in which he
advised that he would deduct from amounts otherwise payable by him to the
respondents, costs and expenses relating to faulty pumps.  He gave evidence that thereafter Septic
Products commenced to keep records ""...
as most efficiently as we could ..."" of such costs and expenses.

 

I conclude that Schedule ""A"" does not
record all Doc 3 pumps replaced in early 1991 but, having regard to Mr
Brookfield's evidence that from February 1991 it was apparent that the problems
with the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps were not isolated problems, I find that his
record keeping would have become generally accurate as to the replacement of
pumps from at least about April/May 1991. 
From about June/July 1991 I find that his record keeping was thorough.

 

As mentioned above, 70 Doc 3 pumps were
supplied by the respondent pursuant to orders placed on behalf of Septic
Products.  One additional pump was
supplied pursuant to a warranty claim.

 

Schedule ""A"" shows the installation
of 22 Doc 3 pumps in new systems later than 18 April 1991.  No pumps were delivered to the applicants by
the respondent between 12 March and 18 April 1991. It seems unlikely that as at
18 April 1991 Septic Products was in possession of significant numbers of pumps
sold by the respondent to Mr Brookfield trading as Brookfield Plumbing
Services.  I conclude that Septic Products
probably installed 22 of the Doc 3 pumps supplied to it in new systems.  Of the 22 pumps shown by Schedule
""A"" to have been installed in new systems later than 18 April
1991, 10 are shown to have failed by fusion due to water ingress.  The information on Schedule ""A"" as
to 1 such pump is unclear but may indicate that it was still operating as at
the date of the Schedule.  As to the
remaining 11 of the 22 pumps installed in new systems, Schedule
""A"" indicates that no records as to their performance are
available.  Although some of these
11 pumps may have failed in use, I am unable to be satisfied that more
than a small number so failed.  The
reason for the unavailability of records at this late stage in the relationship

between the applicants and the respondent, in my view, is likely to be that
problems were not experienced with the pumps.

 

It is impossible to work out from Schedule
""A"", or from other evidence, how many of the additional 48 pumps sold
by the respondent to Septic Products were installed in new systems and how many
were used to replace failed pumps in existing systems.  It is similarly impossible to work out how
many of them failed in service.

 

On the basis that there is apparently no reason
to conclude that the 22 Doc 3 pumps referred to above were not a representative
sample of the Doc 3 pumps supplied by the respondent to Septic Products, I find
that, on the balance of probabilities, approximately 50% of the Doc 3 pumps so
supplied failed in use.  That is,
approximately 35 such pumps.

 

I point out that there is evidence which tends
to suggest that this is not an ungenerous assessment so far as the applicants
are concerned.  On 2 October 1991
Mr Brookfield wrote to the respondent and advised that Septic Products
would no longer continue to use the Doc range of pumps supplied by the
respondent.  The letter includes the
following passage:-

 

     ""As your office was
advised, any expense incurred as of July 1st, 1991 will be charged against our
invoice amount outstanding as we are no longer prepared to outlay the many
hours of labour required to go out on site and change faulty pumps.  We have also been charged labour by our
interstate agents for changing faulty pumps.

 




     The nine faulty pumps
you are now in possession of are also being deducted from the invoice amount as
we are not prepared to place any more of these pumps out in the field.

 

     To date from July 1st, 1991 we
are returning 2 DOC 7's and 7 DOC 3's with a value of $1,712.00.  We also have accumulated 93 hours in
replacing and travelling to locations where pumps have failed.  This has cost $6,464.00 in wages, fuel and
vehicle costs.

 

     This results in a total
deductable cost of $8,176.00 from our invoice amounts.  We will finalise the outstanding amount of
our account as soon as possible.  I am
currently interstate making arrangements for collection of payments and
repairing several units.""

 

 

Mr Brookfield confirmed under cross-examination
that the 9 pumps referred to in the second paragraph of the above extract are
the same 9 pumps referred to in the third paragraph.

 

It was submitted on behalf of the respondent
that the letter of 2 October 1991 gives an accurate figure for the number
of pumps which failed between 1 July - 2 October 1991.  This was denied by Mr Brookfield, but I find
his evidence in this regard unconvincing. 
In particular, the undertaking to finalise the outstanding amount of the
account as soon as possible suggests strongly against further claims against
the respondent being held in reserve.  I
note also that in a letter dated 9 October 1991 addressed to the respondent and
signed by him, Mr Brookfield particularises the claim for the costs of
replacing the 9 pumps referred to in his earlier letter as ""... Parco Beaver Australia's cost to replace faulty pumps
including labour and travelling expenses to date 30th, September 1991.""  Moreover, in his affidavit evidence, Mr
Brookfield stated that his letter of 9 October 1991 provided ""... a break down of pump failure and
job 
locations for pumps replaced in the period 1st July to 30th September
1991.""  I do not accept the oral
evidence of Mr Brookfield to the effect that he did not intend the above
passage to be read literally.

 

I find that Mr Brookfield's letter of 2 October
1991 gives an accurate figure for the number of pumps supplied by the
respondent which failed between 1 July - 30 September 1991.  The number of Doc 3 pumps which are recorded
in the letter as having failed is 7.

 

Although pumps with the bottom bearing housing
problem, on the evidence, tended to fail quickly after being placed in service,
Schedule ""A"" suggests that the Doc 3 pumps without this problem
tended to fail, if at all, between roughly 2-16 months after being
commissioned, and on average roughly 8 months after being commissioned.  In view of the length of time that the
respondent had been supplying Doc 3 pumps to the applicants by 30 September
1991, and the evidence of the time frame within which such pumps tended to
fail, if they failed at all, the failure of 7 Doc 3 pumps in that 3 month
period is not suggestive of a failure rate higher than that which I have
accepted, namely approximately 50%.

 

Nonetheless a failure rate of 50% within a
relatively short period indicates, and I so find, that the Doc 3 pumps were not
fit for the purpose for which they were in fact used.

 




Is the purpose for which the Doc 3 pumps were
in fact used the particular purpose which I have found was made known to the
respondent:  that is, the particular
purpose of acting as a recirculation pump in a Parco Beaver system?

 

As mentioned above, Mr Brookfield devised a
modification to the Parco Beaver system. 
This modification involved the replacement of the Parco Beaver filter
medium of cut plastic piping with a disc pack. 
Mr Brookfield commenced to install Parco Beaver systems incorporating
disc packs in South Australia in 1990 and in New South Wales in early
1991.  Although at different times
Mr Brookfield gave apparently conflicting answers as to whether all Parco
Beaver systems installed by him in South Australia during 1990 and 1991
incorporated disc packs, it appears on the whole of the evidence that they
did.  It appears that
Mr Brookfield's supply of cut plastic piping was exhausted some time in
1991.  Thereafter all Parco Beaver
systems installed by the applicants utilised disc packs as the filter
medium.  From September 1991 the waste
water system installed by Septic Products was the BPS system.  The BPS system used disc packs as the filter
medium.  However, as Septic Products
ceased purchasing pumps from the respondent in August 1991, it seems unlikely
that many Doc 3 pumps were installed in BPS systems.

 

I conclude that all, or nearly all, waste water
systems installed by Septic products utilised disc packs as the filter
medium.  Moreover, it seems likely that
the preponderance of Doc 3 pumps supplied to Septic Products which were used to
replace failed Doc 3 pumps supplied to Mr Brookfield trading as Brookfield
Plumbing Services would have been installed in waste water systems which
utilised disc packs as the filter medium.

 

Mr Brookfield conceded in his oral evidence
that most of the failures of Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps experienced by the
applicants occurred in systems which utilised filter packs as the filter
medium.  He accepted that Schedule
""A"" showed only ""a
handful"" of failures in systems not using filter packs.  The Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps referred to in
Schedule ""A"" include pumps which had the bottom bearing housing
problem but which were installed in waste water systems because the fault was
not apparent.

 

The only academically qualified expert with
experience in waste water process design who gave evidence at the hearing of
this matter was Mr Mark Gobbie (""Mr
Gobbie"").  Mr Gobbie was
retained by the solicitors for the respondent to review the design features,
performance and operation of the BPS waste water system.  In doing so he necessarily gave consideration
to the operational significance of using disc packs in lieu of cut plastic
piping as a filter medium.  Mr Gobbie
expressed the opinions, which I accept, that horizontal medium, such as the
disc packs, are likely to lead to uneven biomass growth, and that uneven
biomass growth will result in large pieces of biomass sloughing from the filter
medium into the area of the holding tank in which the recirculation pump (for
present purposes, the Doc 3 pump) operates. 
Although Mr Gobbie assumed, contrary to the fact, that disc packs would
not be serviced, I do not consider that this factor affects his above opinions.  A view of waste water systems, including a
BPS system, was held early in the hearing of this matter.  The BPS system seen on the view was one which
the evidence established to have been regularly serviced.  Uneven biomass distribution on the top disc
of the disc pack was pointed out to me and observed by me.  Also pointed out to, and observed by me, were
lumps of biomass on the surface of the holding tank below the disc pack.  What I saw on the view in this regard tends,
in my view, to provide support for the opinion expressed by Mr Gobbie (s54 of
the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)).

 

Mr Wilsdon gave evidence of Doc 3 and Doc 7
pumps returned by Mr Brookfield to the respondent having large quantities
of thick waste material in and around the pumps' external workings of the shaft
and the impeller.  His evidence was that
after the removal of such material the pumps operated satisfactorily.

 

There is other evidence that a number of failed
pumps returned to the respondent showed on examination a build up of bacteria
growth.  Mr Brookfield himself gave
evidence of seeing approximately 9 dismantled Doc 3 pumps previously
returned by him to the respondent:  on
each of them he saw a dried substance around the impeller and the pump shaft
which, when he rubbed it between his finger and thumb, ground down to a fine
gritty substance.  His evidence is that
he recognised the dried substance immediately as bacteria culture, and that it
was 
identical to the biomass growth which forms on top of filter packs.

 

The Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps are manufactured with
three lip seals located on the pump shaft. 
The purpose of these seals is to isolate the motor of the pump from the
fluid being pumped (""the working
fluid"").  Each of the experts in
pump design who gave evidence in this case agreed that the Doc 3 and Doc 7
pumps which they had examined which had failed, failed because lip seals
located on the pump shafts failed with the result that working fluid entered
the motors.  The dispute between them was
as to why such seals had failed.

 

Mr John Weir (""Mr Weir""), who was called on behalf of the respondent,
expressed the view that the seals failed because the pumps were operated for an
extended period in an environment containing an excessively high concentration
of abrasive particles.  Emeritus
Professor Peter Joubert (""Professor
Joubert""), the principal pump design expert called on behalf of the
applicant, on the other hand, expressed the view that the seals had failed
because the pump shafts were manufactured from a steel which was too soft for
use with lip-seals.  Professor Joubert
expressed the opinion, which I have no reason to doubt, that the Doc 3 and Doc
7 pumps tested by him had shafts which were softer than the minimal hardness
recommended in an accepted handbook of machine design for shafts that contact
lip-seals.  However, he made it plain
that, so far as wear is concerned, 
hardness is not the only factor.  He
pointed out that wear is a very complicated phenomenon which cannot be
predicted.

 

If the Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps were manufactured
with a shaft which was too soft for use with lip-seals in all circumstances,
one would expect such pumps to fail irrespective of the use to which they were
put.  The fact that the Doc 3 pumps
failed at a much higher rate than the Doc 7 pumps suggests that some additional
factor, or factors, was or were involved. 
Moreover, as Mr Weir pointed out, one would expect the wear grooves at
the location of the lip-seals to be relatively uniform if the problem were one
involving no variables other than the nature of the seals and the strength of
the shafts.  The evidence establishes
that on Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps where the lip-seals had failed, the grooves at
the location of the lip-seals were deepest at the lip-seal closest to the
impeller and shallowest at the lip-seal closest to the motor.  This gradation of the grooves suggests a
relationship between the working fluid and the failure of the lip-seals.  Professor Joubert in his oral evidence
appeared to accept that such a relationship was likely.

 

It was not suggested on behalf of either party
that there was any difference in the hardness of the shafts of Doc 3 and Doc 7
pumps.  Mr Brookfield himself gave
evidence of the satisfactory working of Doc 7 pumps in the Parco Beaver
system.  At the time when he first
approached the respondent with respect to purchasing pumps from it, he had been
using Doc 7 pumps supplied by Allwater in Parco Beaver systems since 1989.  As is mentioned above, he had witnessed extensive
testing of Doc 7 pumps by Allwater, apparently in conjunction with the
respondent.  He had found that the Doc 7
pumps performed satisfactorily in the Parco Beaver system and he was happy to
continue to use them.  I regard this as
compelling evidence that the steel with which the Doc 7 pump shafts are
manufactured is not in practice too soft for the satisfactory operation of such
pumps in Parco Beaver systems.

 

Moreover, Mr Wilsdon gave unchallenged evidence
of the sale of 22,017 Doc 3 pumps by the respondent between 1988 and 1993
and of the sale of 4,689 Doc 7 pumps over the same period.  He was only able to give evidence of warranty
replacements of Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps between 1990-1994.  His evidence was that during that period 740
Doc 3 pumps and 297 Doc 7 pumps were replaced under warranty.  Whilst there may be reason to doubt that such
figures are precisely accurate, I accept that they reflect the order of the
number of pumps so replaced. 
I further accept Mr Wilsdon's evidence that a number of the
Doc 3 and Doc 7 pumps sold by the respondent over the periods referred to
above were sold to customers other than the applicants for use in waste water
systems and that the return rate of such pumps was not out of the ordinary.

 

The Doc 3 and the Doc 7 pumps serve different
purposes in the Parco Beaver system. 
Each of them operates in the second, or holding tank, but the Doc 7,
which is the irrigation pump, may be expected to pump water which is cleaner
than the water required to be pumped by the Doc 3 or recirculation pump.  Mr Brookfield acknowledged that the
applicants' records indicated that only ""a
handful"" of Doc 3 pumps supplied to the applicants had failed in
systems which did not have the disc pack modification.  There was no attempt made on behalf of the
applicant to call admissible evidence of Doc 3 pumps failing in significant
numbers in Parco Beaver systems which did not have the disc pack modification,
or in any other waste water systems.

 

I find that, on the balance of probabilities,
there is a relationship between the established failure of a significant
proportion of the Doc 3 pumps supplied to Septic Products by the respondent and
the modification effected by Mr Brookfield to the Parco Beaver system.  The evidence does not disclose that
Mr Brookfield, or any other person on behalf of the applicants, advised
the respondent of the modification made by Mr Brookfield to the Parco Beaver
system.

 

Although Septic Products may be taken to have
made known to the respondent that the Doc 3 pumps were required for use as
recirculation pumps in Parco Beaver systems, the failure to inform the
respondent of the modification effected to the system (which modification I
have found affected the working environment of the Doc 3 pumps) has the
consequence, in my view, that Septic Products did not make known to the
respondent the particular purpose for which the Doc 3 pumps were required.

 

The claim for breach of an implied condition of
the contracts of sale of Doc 3 pumps between Septic Products and the respondent
based upon the first proviso of s14 of the Sale of Goods Act must fail.

 

The second proviso to s14 of the Sale of Goods
Act is in the following terms:-

 

     ""II  Where goods are bought by description from a
seller who deals in goods of that description ..., there is an implied
condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality:  Provided that if the buyer has examined the
goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such
examination ought to have revealed ...""

 

 

It is not contested in this case that the Doc 3
pumps were bought by description and that the respondent dealt at the relevant
time in goods of that description.  No
party chose to hazard what that description might have been.  The description on the evidence must, I
think, have been that of ""Lowara Doc
3 sump pumps"", or perhaps, simply ""sump
pumps"".  It was not suggested
that any examination made of the goods ought to have revealed defects.  The issue here raised is that of whether the
Doc 3 pumps sold by the respondent to Septic Products were of merchantable
quality.

 

The Sale of Goods Act does not include a
definition of ""merchantable
quality"".  In Australian Knitting Mills Limited
& Anor v Grant (1933) 50 CLR 387 at 418 Dixon J said:-

 

     ""The condition that goods
are of merchantable quality requires that they should be in such an actual
state that a buyer fully acquainted with the fact and, therefore, knowing what
hidden defects exist and not being limited to their apparent condition would
buy them without abatement of the price obtainable for such goods if in
reasonably sound order and condition and without special terms.""




Proof of unfitness for a particular purpose
will not always amount to evidence of unmerchantability.  In George
Wills and Company Limited v Davids Proprietary Limited (1957) 98 CLR 77 at
88 the High Court stated:-

 

     ""Before goods can be
characterised as unmerchantable it must be shown that,
as goods of that description on character, they
are defective ...""  (emphasis in
the original) 

 

 

The Court in that case went on to approve a
passage from Benjamin on Sale 8th Ed
p645 which asserted, quoting as it seems from Farwell LJ in Bristol Tramways &c Carriage Co Ltd v
Fiat Motors Ltd [1910] 2 KB 831 at 841, that goods are of merchantable
quality ""... [if they are] of such a
quality and in such a condition that a reasonable man acting reasonably would
after a full examination accept them under the circumstances of the case in
performance of his offer to buy them, whether he buys them for his own use or
to sell again.""

 

With reference to whether an article sold by
description is of merchantable quality, the learned author of Sutton on The Sale of Goods in Australia and
New Zealand (2nd ed, Law Book Co, Sydney, 1974) at p173 asserts:-

 

     ""It must be capable of
passing in the market or in the trade under the name or description by which it
is sold.  It is not enough that the
article is saleable to somebody at some price; for a use can always be found
for goods if the price is low enough.  A
buyer will put up with serious defects in return for a substantial statement of
price.  The goods must be acceptable
generally in the market under the description with all its defects known and
the fact that articles of the same character are being bought and sold in the
market in large quantities is relevant in this connection.""




The evidence of Mr Wilsdon referred to above is
of large quantities of Doc 3 pumps being sold in the Australian market.

 

This case has, in my view, many similarities
with the case of Jillawarra Grazing
Company v John Shearer Ltd (1984) ATPR 40-441.  In that case, which involved an airseeder
purchased by the applicant from the respondent, at 45,089 Toohey J said:-

 

 

     ""I am not persuaded that
the airseeder was of unmerchantable quality in the sense in which that term has
been considered by the Courts; indeed I am satisfied that it was of
merchantable quality.  As an airseeder
or, if it is permissible to impose a gloss and say an airseeder capable of
carrying out the work for which it was designed, the airseeder met the
test.  The experience of John Shearer
with similar airseeders sold throughout Australia would indicate that the
machine is one that a reasonable purchaser would accept ...

 

 

     As I have concluded, the
difficulties encountered by Jillawarra stemmed in the main from Mr. Bunter's
decision to drive the airseeder with a hydromotor.  I should not be taken as holding that John
Shearer should not have anticipated that the airseeder might be driven by a
hydraulic motor as well as by a power take-off. 
What I am saying is that a purchaser who decided to install a hydromotor
was obliged to ensure that the hydraulic drive was appropriately designed and
installed.  ...  The applicant did not seek the respondent's
advice in this respect and the latter cannot be held responsible for any vice
in the airseeder that was a consequence of an inadequate hydraulic
system.""

 

I find that the applicants have failed to
establish that the Doc 3 pumps sold by the respondent to Septic Products
were not of merchantable quality.

 

In my opinion the claims against the respondent
for breach of the contracts between Septic Products and the respondent fail.

 

The application will be dismissed.

 

I will hear counsel as to costs.

5821,2707320,Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The applicant was tried on an indictment containing the following three counts:
Count 1: On or about 3rd October 2008 at or near Kingswood in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], a child then under the age of ten years, namely six years.
Count 2: On or about 3rd October 2008 at or near Kingswood in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] a child then under the age of ten years, namely six years.
Count 3:  On 4th October at Kingswood in the State of New South Wales did assault [the complainant] and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on [the complainant] a person under ten years, namely six years.
2The applicant went to trial, which was aborted when the defence successfully applied for a discharge of the jury. At the second trial the jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 2 but was unable to reach a verdict on count 3 and the jury was discharged in respect of that count.
3In relation to count 1, the sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of 5 years imprisonment. With respect to count 2, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of 11 years with a further term of 4 years. The sentences were made wholly concurrent.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal his convictions on counts 1 and 2 and also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences which were imposed.
The facts
5The complainant lived with his mother in Moree. In October 2008 the complainant, his mother and his grandmother came to stay with a relative in Sydney.
6The applicant was about 20 years of age at the time and was a friend of the person with whom the complainant's family stayed in Sydney. The applicant was at the house on 3 October 2008, as were a number of other people. At some stage during the late evening the applicant left the house to go to the local shops. The complainant went with him. 
7It was the Crown case that having left the house the applicant drove his car to a secluded area where he asked the complainant to suck his penis. The complainant refused. It was alleged that the applicant then pulled down the complainant's pants and licked and sucked his penis. This was the act that constituted count 1 on the indictment. The Crown further alleged that the applicant then pulled the complainant's pants further down and, while the complainant was sitting on his lap, inserted his erect penis into the complainant's anus. This was the act that constituted count 2 on the indictment.
8The Crown alleged that the complainant shortly afterwards asked the applicant to take him to a toilet because he had poo coming out of his bottom. It was alleged that they went to a McDonalds restaurant where the complainant was able to go to the toilet. The complainant said that he took his underpants off because there were ""bits of poo"" in them and showed his underpants to the applicant. He said that they subsequently returned to the friend's house. The Crown case was that once they had returned to the house the complainant put his underpants in the washing machine, had a shower and was put to bed by his grandmother. 
9The Crown further alleged that the applicant came back to the house the following day. The Crown alleged that the applicant and the complainant were for a time at the dining table drawing. They later sat on the lounge and watched a movie. When the complainant was sitting on the applicant's lap the Crown alleged that he started to play with the complainant's penis. This allegation constituted count 3 on the indictment.
10A little later that day the complainant, his mother and grandmother left Sydney and returned to Moree. On 28 December, which was about three months after the alleged incident, the complainant for the first time told his mother and grandmother about what he alleged had occurred in Sydney. The matter was then reported to the police. It was not until some 3 weeks later that the applicant was interviewed.
11When he was interviewed the applicant admitted that he had met the complainant in Sydney and that the two of them had gone out together during the course of the evening. However, he denied sexually assaulting or indecently assaulting the complainant.
The appeal
12The applicant originally filed seven grounds of appeal. However, Grounds 1, 2 and 5 were abandoned and it is only necessary to consider Grounds 3, 4, 6 and 7. Those grounds were pleaded as follows:
Ground 3: The trial judge's admission of, and refusal to exclude, the evidence of the Crown's expert created a miscarriage of justice.
Ground 4: The trial judge's admission of, and refusal to exclude, the lay evidence of the complainant's constipation created a miscarriage of justice.
Ground 6: Inconsistent verdicts.
Ground 7: Unreasonable verdicts.
Ground 3
13Ground 3 is concerned with the admission of the evidence of Dr Marks. Dr Marks is a general practitioner in the Child Protection Unit at Westmead Hospital. She gave evidence about the possible cause of the constipation that the complainant was alleged to have experienced on the journey back to Moree. It was submitted by the applicant that her evidence was ""irrelevant, neutral and unfairly prejudicial.""
14The applicant drew attention to the history of events which preceded the trial. Some time before the trial the Crown prosecutor and defence counsel discussed the evidence that would be led at the trial. The applicant alleged that as a result of this discussion the defence understood that the Crown would not be leading evidence from Dr Marks. I am satisfied that in this respect defence counsel misunderstood the position.
15It seems that the original trial was aborted following an application by defence counsel, primarily because he had only recently been provided with the medical report of Dr Marks. The defence quite reasonably sought time to obtain medical advice to respond to the evidence which Dr Marks was expected to give if called at the trial.
16A number of months elapsed between the first and the second trial. During that time those representing the applicant sought advice from a general practitioner in relation to the issue raised by Dr Marks. The practitioner who was consulted suggested that it may be a matter appropriate for a psychologist. However, for reasons which were not satisfactorily explained, the defence did not engage a psychologist. 
17At the trial defence counsel told the judge that he had understood that the Crown would not pursue the issue raised by Dr Marks and that it was for this reason that the question of retaining a psychologist had not been pursued. A further adjournment was sought. His Honour declined to grant that adjournment concluding that if there had been a misunderstanding it had only occurred a few days before the trial. Months had passed since the first trial in which the defence could have retained a psychologist if there was a practitioner who could assist the applicant's case. 
18There was also a controversy as to whether the defence had been aware, or at least should have been alerted to the possibility, that Dr Marks may support the suggestion that the complainant had suffered an injury to his anus during the assault that may have resulted in a difficulty for him in opening his bowels. The trial judge ruled that the defence should have been alert to this possibility. I agree with that view. The defence should have appreciated the issues that they had to confront if Dr Marks gave evidence.
19The primary evidence on this issue came from the complainant's mother and grandmother. Their evidence was that on the trip back to Moree on the Sunday the complainant had difficulty going to the toilet. They gave evidence that they had to stop on a number of occasions during the trip home so that he could access a toilet and attempt to open his bowels. This evidence of the complainant's constipation was excluded during the original trial on the basis that it had no relevance in the absence of medical evidence as to its significance. It was the evidence of Dr Marks that gave it apparent significance.
20Because the complainant made no complaint until some three months after the alleged events he was not medically examined at a time proximate to the alleged assault. When he was examined there were no obvious physical signs of trauma or injury.
21Dr Marks did not examine, meet or speak to the complainant, his mother or his grandmother. She did read the grandmother's police statement and also spoke to one of the complainant's general practitioners. She said in a statement that ""the sudden onset of constipation is highly likely to have been attributable to a painful and/or frightening experience that resulted in [the complainant] holding onto stool."" 
22The admissibility of Dr Marks' evidence was explored by way of a voir dire when the nature and extent of her evidence was explored. She expressed the opinion that the complainant's difficulty in passing stool was consistent with there having been the alleged sexual penetration of his anus. It was for this reason that the Crown sought to tender the evidence from the complainant's grandmother as to the history of the complainant's constipation on the day following the alleged assault.
23The applicant's counsel objected to the admission of the evidence of Dr Marks at the trial for the reason that it was not evidence of an examination and diagnosis of the complainant's condition at or about the time of the alleged events. Furthermore, it was asserted that when he was being examined by different practitioners the complainant's mother or grandmother gave different accounts of his symptoms.
24After he complained of the assault the complainant was taken by his mother to a general practitioner in Moree, Dr Alan. Dr Alan's notes indicate that he was told by the complainant's mother or grandmother that the applicant had constipation after the event and pain with an open bowel but was by the time of the examination ""okay."" This was inconsistent with the report of Dr Power, to whom Dr Alan referred the complainant, who said that the complainant had reported to him that his bowel actions were painless even immediately after the assault.
25On a later occasion, unconnected with the alleged assault, when the complainant was examined by another general practitioner, Dr Percival, she reported ""concerned about bowels in that he blows off frequently. Tends to squat on the toilet when he opens his bowels and takes some time to go to the toilet. ?constipated. Diet deficient in fibre."" Dr Percival prescribed medication to assist in opening the complainant's bowels. 
26The applicant submitted to the trial judge that in these circumstances the evidence would be of little value to the jury. His counsel emphasised that although the mother and grandmother had reported that the complainant had experienced constipation following the alleged assault, the complainant did not complain of pain at that time. Furthermore, the complainant was not experiencing constipation at the time of his examination three months later, although, importantly, on a later examination constipation was diagnosed as being a result of a deficiency  of fibre in the complainant's diet.
27The applicant also emphasised the fact that the evidence on the voir dire revealed that, although the complainant normally ate cooked meals and vegetables, he did not normally eat take away food. On the trip to Sydney the family had eaten pizzas and other take away food and, accordingly, it was suggested that a change in his bowel function may have been a result of this temporary change in his diet.
28The trial judge decided to admit both the lay and expert evidence relating to this issue. However, his Honour limited the evidence to evidence of the complainant's alleged constipation on the trip home from Sydney and the opinion of Dr Marks as to its significance. 
29Before this Court it was submitted that his Honour erred in admitting this evidence. Counsel submitted that in her report Dr Marks had failed to set out any diagnostic criteria for constipation. However, she had referred to it in her oral evidence when she said that her definition of constipation ""would be either the passage of very hard stool or extremely infrequent passage of stool."" Having regard to this definition it was submitted that there was no evidence of hard stool passed by the complainant proximate to the alleged assault and it was submitted that ""evidence of difficulty going to the toilet over the period of a drive of a few hours duration could not, on any reasonable test, have satisfied the requirement of 'extremely infrequent passage of stool'."" 
30It was further submitted that the evidence in relation to the issue of constipation should have been excluded because the evidence suggested that there were more common causes of constipation than sexual assault, including change in diet or deficiency in fibre. Because of the evidence of a change in the complainant's diet and also evidence that it was later identified that his diet may have been deficient in fibre, it was submitted that the evidence of constipation being related to the alleged sexual assault was lacking in any significant probative force.
31The applicant makes a further complaint. During the course of the voir dire evidence Dr Marks offered the opinion, which was not contained in her written report, that the complainant had or may have suffered from a specific physical injury; namely an anal tear or fissure, and it was for that reason that he may have had pain in passing stool leading to his constipation. Dr Marks had not previously offered this opinion. Her evidence had previously been confined to the possibility that the difficulty in passing stool may have been due to the frightening or painful experience of the sexual assault.
32In response to the applicant's submissions the Crown submitted that, whether labelled as constipation or mere difficulty in passing stool, the relevant issue was what could have caused this condition in the complainant. It was submitted that it was for the jury to determine whether the complainant had experienced the difficulties that were asserted by the Crown and, if they accepted that they had occurred, to assess the significance of them having regard to Dr Marks' evidence.
33It was further submitted that rather than the Crown raising the issue, it was during the questioning of Dr Marks by the trial judge that Dr Marks directly raised the possibility of injury to the anal region of the complainant being a cause of his constipation. In response to a question from his Honour, Dr Marks said:
""Okay, so that suggests to me that most likely he has some sort of injury to his anal region, like an anal fissure, and he - and it hurts to pass stool so he's reluctant to, and that's been building up ....""
34The Crown submitted that the evidence of the complainant having difficulty with his bowel motions was sufficiently cogent that it should be admitted, as should the evidence of Dr Marks as to the likely cause of the problem.
35Although there was considerable debate about Dr Marks' evidence and the lay evidence relating to constipation upon which it was based, the argument at trial for the rejection of this evidence was limited. It was never suggested that the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, although this may be inherent in trial counsel's submission. 
36In summary, the submission to this Court was that the evidence should have been rejected because it was irrelevant, neutral and unfairly prejudicial. To my mind, there is no foundation for the proposition that the evidence was necessarily irrelevant or neutral. It is plain that if the complainant did suffer from constipation the day after the alleged assault, and there was evidence that it could have been caused by the actions of the applicant, it would be relevant. Depending upon the cogency of the evidence it may be important evidence in the Crown case. In that event the only question was whether it was unfairly prejudicial. 
37To my mind, when Dr Marks' evidence is considered in its entirety it provides little, if any, support for a conclusion that any act of the applicant was the cause of the complainant's asserted difficulty in opening his bowels. Her evidence clearly suggested, using her words that ""there were alternative and more common sense causes"" for the complainant's alleged constipation. She accepted that constipation in a young child could be due to multiple causes. As I have indicated, there was evidence that on a later occasion the complainant was diagnosed with constipation unrelated to any allegation of sexual assault for which appropriate treatment was provided. As a consequence, the probative force of Dr Marks' evidence was minimal. 
38To my mind if the jury were not carefully directed on the subject the evidence was also capable of being given disproportionate weight by the jury. Apart from this evidence the Crown case required the jury to assess the credibility and reliability of the complainant on his account of the events and also of the grandmother's account of the events of the Friday night and Saturday. Because Dr Marks' evidence was the opinion of a medical practitioner there was the possibility that the jury could overlook the question of whether they were satisfied of the necessary factual foundation for the opinion and placed inappropriate reliance on it to the detriment of the applicant. For this reason, and being of minimal probative value, to my mind the evidence should have been rejected.
39Notwithstanding these problems I do not believe that the admission of the evidence caused the trial to miscarry. The trial judge was careful when giving the jury directions on these issues. His Honour provided the jury with a careful summary of Dr Marks' evidence, including reading portions of it from the transcript. The portions which he extracted included passages where the doctor had indicated that there could be a number of causes of constipation unrelated to any allegation of sexual assault including a recent change in diet. His Honour also drew the jury's attention to the evidence from Dr Power's notes that the victim reported no pain in his bowel movements immediately after the assault. This operated to neutralise the risk that the jury might otherwise misuse the evidence. The result was that the jury would be likely to have concluded that the evidence added nothing of any significance to the Crown case.
40For this reason I would reject Ground 3 of the appeal.
Ground 4
41Ground 4 is in essence a repetition of Ground 3. In my opinion the trial judge should have also excluded the lay evidence. However, I do not believe its admission occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 
Ground 6
42This ground arises from the fact that the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to counts 1 and 2 but could not reach agreement in relation to count 3. The verdicts were not strictly inconsistent, there being no verdict returned in relation to count 3. However, in any event, I am not satisfied that the applicant's complaint is justified.
43The trial judge was careful to tell the jury that they were required to consider each count separately. His Honour gave a direction that was consistent with the discussion in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 and with the remarks of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606. The trial judge said:
""So, giving separate consideration to the individual counts means that you are entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on some other counts, as the logical reason for that outcome. And I repeat, if you were to find the accused not guilty on any account, particularly if that was because you had doubts about the reliability of the complainant's evidence you would have to consider how that conclusion affected your consideration of the remaining counts.""
44When the trial judge raised with counsel the consistency between the jury's verdicts in relation to counts 1 and 2 and their inability to reach a verdict on count 3 there was a discussion about possible explanations. One explanation that was proffered was that the jury may have found that the applicant touched the complainant on the outside of his clothes in a brushing or similar manner without committing the intentional act alleged in the charge. This possibility was supported by evidence from the applicant's grandmother about where the two were sitting at the time and the fact that the applicant's hands were over the complainant's shoulder around his belly area and not his groin. 
45Another and, in my opinion, more likely explanation is the difficulty in identifying the precise time at which the alleged event may have occurred. The indictment pleaded count 3 as having occurred on 4 October 2008. The complainant asserted that the indecent assault had occurred when he was sitting with the applicant on the lounge watching ""Snakes on a Plane."" The evidence was not clear as to whether this happened late on the Friday evening or on the Saturday. If it had occurred on the Friday evening the offence would not be proved because the date pleaded in relation to this count was the Saturday. 
46I have carefully reviewed the evidence of the complainant. I can detect no distinction in its quality in relation to any particular count that may explain the jury's decision. The circumstances in which the jury failed to return a verdict in relation to count 3 do not inevitably indicate that the jury rejected the complainant as a witness of truth and accordingly should have acquitted the applicant of all of the charges.
47Accordingly I would reject Ground 6 of the appeal.
Ground 7
48In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR  400 at [11]-[14] (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ), the High Court set out the test to be applied when considering an appeal on the basis that a verdict was unreasonable:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal
It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v R [(1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493] by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 
'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'
This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v R [(2002) 213 CLR 606 at [58]], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say: 
'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'
Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.
In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""(footnotes omitted)
49In the present matter the Crown case depended upon the jury accepting the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant. It was submitted by defence counsel at the trial (and the submission was repeated to this Court) that the complainant was an unreliable witness. Counsel submitted that his story ""shifted"" significantly in two respects and, on both occasions, in a manner directly inconsistent with what he had previously asserted. It was further submitted that the complainant had been subjected to improper questioning by his grandmother who, it was submitted, had suggested answers to the complainant consistent with the applicant having committed an offence.
50I have reviewed the evidence at the trial in detail. The complainant gave an account that when the applicant said that he was going to the shops he asked whether he could go with him. His grandmother said he could. He said that the applicant drove somewhere and parked at a place where ""you fix up wheels."" He said that the applicant wanted the complainant to suck his ""rude part"" but he did not. He said that the applicant then sucked his ""rude part.""
51He said that when they were in the car the applicant sucked his ""rude part"" twice. He said that the applicant pulled his pants down and crouched over ""and just licked ... a little bit then just done it.""
52The complainant said that the applicant asked him to jump over to where he was sitting. He said that he went over and sat on the applicant's lap, facing away from him. He said that the applicant then put his ""rude part"" in the complainant's ""butt."" He said that ""it felt like a shark attack."" He said that he cried and was screaming because it hurt. He said he was screaming out the window. 
53The complainant said that after the applicant stopped putting his ""noodle up his butt"" ""poo was coming out."" He said that when he moved it felt like he was ""sweating in his bottom."" He told the applicant ""I feel something, so it feels like wee's coming out.""
54The complainant then said that they went somewhere so that he could wipe his bottom. He said that ""little bits of poo were coming out."" He said that although the applicant went into the toilet with him he wiped his own bottom.
55The complainant said that when he wiped his bottom there were ""little bits of poo"" on his underpants. He said that he took his underpants off and the applicant took them and put them in his pocket. When they got home the complainant said the applicant gave them back to him and he put them in the washing machine.
56The complainant said that when they got home the applicant touched ""his rude part"" again when they were sitting on the lounge. He said that the applicant grabbed him and put him on his lap and started playing with his ""noodle."" He said that the applicant's hands were on the outside of his clothes.
57There was some controversy at the trial about how long the applicant and the complainant were absent from the house on the evening of 3 October. The complainant's grandmother believed that it was probably about an hour and ten minutes and that they returned at a time ""between midnight and just after midnight."" When they arrived home the complainant had a shower and started crying. The complainant's grandmother thought that he was ""playing up"" because his mother was not there. She said that he then went to bed.
58The grandmother gave evidence of the event on the couch (count 3), saying that it was the next day. She said that it was in the afternoon when the complainant and the applicant were watching television. She said the applicant was seated on the left hand side of the lounge and had his arm around the complainant, who was on his right. She said the complainant was ""laying into"" the applicant. She said that she could not see the applicant's hands but believed they were over the complainant's shoulder and around his belly area.
59The applicant was interviewed by the police. In his ERISP he said that he had driven from the house where the complainant was staying with him to a kebab place, but it was shut. For this reason he said that they went to McDonald's. He said that he bought a triple cheeseburger at McDonald's and believed he bought something for the complainant. He said that he showed the complainant the Aqua Golf course that was beside the Panthers club and next to the McDonald's. He said they got out of the car and then got back into the car and went home. He said they were gone for only about half an hour.
60He said that he did not take the complainant to the toilet at any time. He said that at McDonald's the complainant asked him where the toilets were. He showed the complainant where the toilets were, and he said that the complainant went into the toilet while he waited outside.
61The applicant denied that the reason he had gone out was because the complainant's grandmother had request him to get some milk. He denied taking the complainant to a car park and asking him to suck his penis. He said that he had a five year old son himself and would not say that to anyone's child. He denied pulling down the complainant's pants or sucking his penis. He denied putting his penis into the complainant's anus. He said that the complainant did not show him his underpants and he did not take the complainant's underpants and put them in his pocket.
62The applicant said that he left the house where the complainant was staying about 2 or 2.30 am. He said that he went back the following afternoon when he did some drawing with the complainant and watched television with him. He denied that he touched the complainant's penis. He ultimately said: ""All I know is that I didn't touch the kid. I wouldn't touch him. I wouldn't like it done to my own son so why would I do it to someone else's kid.""
63The applicant also gave evidence at his trial. His evidence was consistent with his ERISP.
64The complainant's grandmother was questioned about the role she had played in questioning the complainant. She said that she did not at any stage ask questions in the form ""Well, did X happen or did Y happen?"" There was evidence from the mother given at the first trial in which she confirmed that the grandmother had asked the complainant ""questions that suggested things that [he] could answer yes or not to?"" However, no particular questions were identified nor responses discussed. Her evidence went further when she denied that her mother had asked leading questions in relation to the critical allegations made by the complainant.
65Even if this had not been the case the complainant's account of the relevant events is compelling. His description of detail including the soiling of his underpants and his description of the applicant's sucking of his penis give no indication that his evidence was fabricated. 
66With respect to the asserted ""shifts"" in the complainant's evidence the applicant's submissions identified two issues. Firstly, it was submitted that although the complainant said that the applicant had sucked his penis his mother had given an account in which she said that she had heard the complainant say that the applicant had not sucked his penis. With respect to the second issue it was submitted that contrary to his original position, in  which the complainant denied that the appellant had made him suck his penis, he later claimed that this had occurred.
67The first ""alleged shift"" is said to be found in the evidence of the complainant's mother given at the second trial when she was, amongst other matters, asked about evidence that she gave at the first trial. At that trial in response to a question in cross-examination the complainant's mother said that the complainant had ""said (the applicant) did not suck his noodle."" This was asserted by counsel to be evidence of the complainant's retraction of the allegation forming the foundation for count 1.
68At the later trial the complainant was asked whether he had told his mother that the applicant did not suck his penis. He responded ""he did."" When cross examined he initially denied telling his mother that the applicant did not suck his penis but when pressed with the question: ""You could have said to her, but now you can't remember. Is that right?"" He responded ""Yes."" The exchange is equivocal although it is clear that the complainant was steadfast in his allegation that the applicant did suck his penis.
69The complainant's mother was asked about this issue at the second trial. The exchange with counsel was transcribed as follows:
""Q. Do you remember being asked this question, at the last trial? ""Did you hear [the complainant] say anything about sucking of noodles.""    And answering, ""He said he didn't."" A.  Yes.
Q. And then you were asked this:'Q. Just give us a conversation, if you could. What did he say? Did he say~ A. I said-
Q. Did [the applicant]-A. Can you ask the question again, please?'
Q: Do you remember that? A.  No.
Q.  And I'm suggesting to you that at that stage you were going to say, ""I said, 'Did [the applicant] suck your noodle?'"" and you stopped yourself. A.  No.
Q.  That's right, isn't it?A.  No.
Q. And I suggest to you that the reason you stopped yourself was because you were aware you shouldn't divulge that you'd asked [the applicant] questions that suggested an answer. A.  [the complainant]?
Q.  [the complainant], sorry. A.  No.
...
Q.  And then you were asked this, after you'd asked for the question to be stated again:
'Q. Just tell us what [the complainant] said about [the applicant] in relation to sucking noodles.A.  He said [the applicant] didn't suck his noodle.'
Q; Do you remember giving that answer? A.  Yes.
Q.  And that's the case, isn't it? That's what he told you? A.  Yes.
HIS HONOURQ.  How did he come to say that? Do you remember? A.  I just had come out of the bathroom and-
Q.  Pardon?A.  I had just come out of the bathroom-
Q.  Yes.A.  -and I heard [the complainant] speaking to Mum, and [the complainant] said, ""[the applicant] asked me to suck his noodle, but I didn't."" And that's what I had heard.
AUSTINQ.  Well, I'm sorry, what you said in that evidence was, ""He said [the applicant] didn't suck his noodle."" Now, was that what he said to you? A.  No.
Q.  So you say now that - but that's what you said at the last trial, wasn't it?A.  Possibly, yes.
Q. Because you recall that the crown prosecutor, who was asking you those questions at that stage, said, ""I beg your pardon.""    Do you remember that he stopped you? A.  No.
Q.  Do you remember the judge then saying, ""He said [the applicant] did not suck his noodle.""  And you saying, ""He said he didn't suck his noodle.""  Do you remember that? A.  No.
Q.  That's what is recorded in the transcript, isn't it?
CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, it's recorded, ""He said he didn't suck his noodle,"" in response to the judge's question.""
70It is plain from these exchanges that there is a confusion in the mother's evidence. At one point in the cross examination the issue was whether the complainant had said that the applicant had not sucked his noodle. At another point the question is whether the complainant had said that he did not suck the applicant's noodle. Although both possibilities were mentioned, the cross examiner's questions did not make the distinction clear. In my opinion the explanation for the apparent contradiction is confusion rather than any deliberate untruth. This evidence is not probative of the suggestion by the applicant that in respect of count 1 the complainant changed his position or has ever said otherwise than that his penis was sucked by the applicant.
71The second issue raised by the applicant as reflecting a shift in the complainant's evidence concerns the issue of whether the complainant had sucked the applicant's penis.
72His mother's evidence in chief was that at some time prior to the first trial the complainant told her that ""he sucked [the applicant's] penis - noodle, and that [the applicant] had sucked his noodle:""
""Q. The only time that you say [the complainant] ever said to you that he had sucked [the applicant's] noodle was sometime after he'd been in counselling.  Is that right? A.  Yes.
Q. And in fact prior to that, that something that he specifically denied having happened, didn't he?A.  Yes.
Q.  He made it very clear to you that that was something that he didn't do?A.  Yes.""
73When the complainant was interviewed by the police he said that the applicant had wanted the complainant to suck his ""rude part"" ""but I didn't."" He was not asked about the matter at the first trial.
74At the second trial the complainant was cross-examined and the following exchange occurred:
""Q: [the complainant], about three months before the last trial, you told your mother that [the applicant] had made you suck his noodle.A: Yes.
Q: You told her that, didn't you?A: Yes.
Q: That wasn't true, was it?A: It was.
Q: It didn't happen.A: It did.
Q: When do you say that happened in the car?A: What do you mean?
Q: You say that this incident took place in the car while it was parked. Is that right?A: Yes.""
75The cross-examination continued but became significantly confused. The complainant both confirmed but also denied the allegation. The transcript reveals the contradictory answers:
""Q.  When do you now say that happened?
HIS HONOURQ.  At what stage of events in the car do you say that happened? A.  I still don't get it
Q. Okay.
AUSTINQ.  Was it before you say [the applicant] put his penis into your bum or after?A.  Before.
Q.  Before. Isn't it the case that you've just told us only a few minutes go that the first thing that happened after you jumped over was that [the applicant] put his penis into your bum? A.  Mm.
Q.  Do you remember you told us that just a few minutes ago? A.  Mm-hmm.
Q.  So thinking back, it wasn't the case that he made you suck his penis, or his noodle, at any stage, was it? A.  You've got me lost
Q.  Got you lost, all right. Do you remember we were talking just a few minutes ago? A. Mm-hmm.
Q.  And one of the things that you told me was that, after [the applicant] said, ""Jump over,"" or words to that effect, the next thing that happened was that he pulled down his pants. A.  Yes.
Q.  Do you remember that? A.  Yes.
Q.  And that - can you understand the word ""penis"" now and what it means, don't you? A.  Yes.
Q.  That he put his penis into your bottom. That's right? A.  Yes.
Q.  If that was right, then what you've just told us about him having a-
HIS HONOUR: That logically doesn't follow.
AUSTIN: Okay.
HIS HONOURQ.  Where were you, ..., when [the applicant] made you suck his penis? Were you were sitting, if you were sitting? Where were you? A.  I was in the passenger side.
Q.  Right, yes.
AUSTINQ.  Didn't you tell us just a few minutes ago that it was when you were in the passenger side that [the applicant] sucked your penis? That's right? A.  Yes.
Q.  Are you now getting confused between that and saying that you then sucked his penis? A.  Yes.
Q.  That didn't happen, did it? A.  It did.
Q.  What, that you sucked his penis? A.  No.
Q.  No, what you have been saying is that he sucked your penis, isn't it?A.  Yes.

HIS HONOURQ.  Well, did he ever make you suck his penis? A.  Yes.

AUSTINQ.  Where do you say that happened? A.  I don't know..(not transcribable)..

HIS HONOURQ.  I know it's hard, and it's an unpleasant thing to think about but try to think back. He parks the car in this wheel fixing place, yes? A.  Yes.
Q.  Okay, now what is the first thing that happens concerning any manner of his doing anything rude to you or asking you to do something rude to him? What's the first thing that happened? A.  Well, him doing stuff rude stuff to me first.
Q.  What was the first rude thing that he did to you? A.  I can't remember.

AUSTIN: Your Honour, I don't think I can take it any further.
HIS HONOUR: Well, since it's been raised.Q.  Is it this right, ...? When you talked to the two Joes, you didn't say to them that [the applicant] had made you suck his penis. Is that correct? Did you tell them that [the applicant] made you suck his penis? A. Yes.
Q.  But not on the video? A.  Mm-hmm.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
AUSTINQ.  You're now saying that you spoke to the two Joes on another occasion other than when it was on the video?

HIS HONOURQ.  Was there a time you spoke to the Joes about what happened that wasn't recorded on the video or to either of the Joes? A.  I'm confused.

HIS HONOUR: I think we all are. That might be where it rests.

AUSTIN: I think, your Honour, it's just - but I suppose for more abundant caution.Q.  When I was speaking to you earlier before the jury came in, you didn't indicate that Corey had made you suck his penis. That's right, isn't it? You didn't say that? That's right? A. I think-
HIS HONOURQ.  Go on, ..., you think what? Say what you want to say. A.  Well, I don't want to say nothing because it's, you know--

AUSTIN: I don't think I can take it anywhere with him. That was the fact though, your Honour, of that evidence.""
76It must be remembered that the complainant was a young child. When giving evidence and cross examined during the intense atmosphere of the trial it is not surprising that his evidence was not given with the clarity that may be expected of an adult in the same circumstances. Although the evidence is equivocal with respect to the allegation that the complainant sucked the applicant's penis that evidence was not the subject of any change. In respect of the allegations comprising count 1 the complainant was consistent in his evidence.
77The jury were aware of these issues and the criticisms which could be made of the complainant. It is apparent that utilising their experience of the world and commonsense they remained satisfied to the relevant standard of the truthfulness of the evidence that the complainant gave with respect to the acts with which the applicant was charged in the indictment.
78Notwithstanding the confusion about this issue, there are a number of aspects of the complainant's evidence which cause me to have no doubt that he was telling the truth in relation to the essential allegations. They were identified by the Crown as follows:
The complainant's description of the applicant's ""rude part"" growing ""a little slower to there.""
The complainant's description of penetration as being ""like a shark attack felt me, like a shark attack.""
The complainant's account that he ""just like cried ... screaming ... cause it hurt.""
The complainant's graphic description of ""little bits of poo coming out ..."" of his bottom and his description of it as ""like green, probably brown"". The complainant's evidence that ""he told me something like the name of the poo comes out of your butt ... like the name of when you do a poo ... when it's green or brown.""
The complainant's description of the sensation in his anus after the event as ""like when you move it feels like you're sweating in your bottom""; and
The complainant's evidence that ""when he stopped doing it I said 'I feel something, so it feels like wees coming out.' ... and then he drove me somewhere.""
79The applicant submitted that there were some ""limitations of the Crown case."" They included the fact that the owner of the premises where the complainant's family stayed did not recall any clothing being left behind or having any underwear in the washing machine. The grandmother said she did not notice whether the complainant's underpants were missing. Furthermore, the complainant's mother could not remember what clothes she had packed before they left on the Sunday. It was also suggested that when the complainant said that the applicant scratched him on the face he had fabricated his evidence because there was no evidence of scratch marks. 
80I do not consider these matters to be of any particular significance. They were incidental events. It must be remembered that it was not until some three months after the alleged assault that the complaint was made and a further significant time elapsed before the witnesses were required to recall these matters. It would not be surprising that the witnesses could not bring them to mind. 
81I am mindful of the fact that the jury saw and heard both the complainant and the applicant give evidence. It is plain that they did not accept the applicant. Although that does not have the consequence that the prosecution must succeed, if I had any doubt in the matter I would have resolved the matter adversely to the applicant, having regard to the advantages which the jury had. However, as I have indicated I have no doubt that the applicant was rightly convicted.
Sentence
82The applicant advanced five grounds of appeal in relation to his sentence. They were as follows:
Ground 1: the trial judge erred in treating the standard non-parole period as creating an ""implied benchmark head sentence.""
Ground 2: the trial judge erred in giving primary significance to the standard non-parole period in the sentencing of the applicant.
Ground 3: the trial judge erred in treating (1) substantial injury and emotional harm and (2) the age of the victim as aggravating factors.
Ground 4: the trial judge erred in rejecting, without any evidentiary basis, the conclusion of the consulting psychologist that the applicant was of a low to moderate risk of re-offending.
Ground 5: the sentences were manifestly excessive.
83These grounds may be considered together. In the course of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said:
""The Crown submitted that the second count in particular, but allied with the first, meant that this was an offence of above mid-range seriousness.
Counsel for the defence submitted that it was either right at the top of the range just below a mid range offence, or alternatively, towards the lower end of a mid range offence.
One cannot in fact hypothesise a single instance of a mid range offence against which to judge this offence, but having regard to the sorts of considerations I have mentioned, leaving aside questions of repeat offending and earlier convictions for sexual offences, or for violence, I think that although there was but a single, relatively short occasion, opportunistically taken advantage of without much forethought by the prisoner, the second count does fall into the mid range of seriousness, though it would be towards the lower end of that range.
The first count, it was, as I understand, agreed on all hands, would itself be well below a mid range offence, notwithstanding the age of the victim.
The standard non-parole period is fifteen years, which implies, if the prima facie ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence were to apply, something like a benchmark of a twenty year head sentence.
Because the offence is towards the lower end of the mid range, because of the prisoner's previous good character and because of his youth even now, he being only twenty-two, I think that the standard non-parole period should not apply.
I also think that a total sentence of twenty years would be excessive.
I proceed to try to fix an appropriate maximum period of liability for imprisonment for the two offences.
For the first offence I think that five years would be ample.
The second offence is more difficult. The learned Crown Prosecutor went to pains to produce, in order to assist the Court, a summary schedule accompanied by summary notes of all of the cases which he could find since this offence was enacted into its current form.""
84Later, his Honour continued:
""Trying to make an assessment of an appropriate sentence, I confess that I am heavily influenced by the great seriousness with which Parliament evidently regards offences of this kind, as evidenced by such a high maximum period of imprisonment and such a high standard non-parole period.
As I said in the course of argument, it seems to me that for a young man, a very young man, a sentence of five years is a heavy sentence, and a sentence of eight years and upwards is a heavy sentence indeed.
I think that nothing but what I would call a very heavy sentence is appropriate, and I think that sentence should, for the second count, be fifteen years.
There is a case for a small degree of accumulation of the sentences.  On the other hand, there is the question of totality, and the necessity in any case not to add to a very heavy sentence for the second count so as to crush any impulses towards rehabilitation which the prisoner may feel or may come to feel.
I therefore think that, in this particular case, also having regard to the very close concurrence in time of the two offences, there should not be accumulation.
I come to consider the non-parole period. The prima facie result would be that there should be a non-parole period of eleven years and three months. There are reasons not to do that, principally being the same as the subjective factors which I have taken into account in fixing the head sentences, but, as has been pointed out, it is important not to engage in double counting, and I have taken into account the prisoner's youth, the fact that this is his first time in gaol, and the other matters to which I referred in fixing the head sentence.
The standard non-parole period, even though I think it should not apply, nevertheless must stand as a benchmark, and I think that to reduce the non-parole period below eleven years would be to allow the prisoner a disproportionate degree of leniency, having regard to that standard non-parole period. I therefore would fix the non-parole period at eleven years.""
85It may be accepted that his Honour erred by setting a fixed term in relation to count 1. That count carried a standard non-parole period which by reason of s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required that a non-parole period be set: SGJ v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]-[78] (Kirby J, Hodgson JA and Hislop J agreeing).
86I am not otherwise persuaded that his Honour's analysis contains the error for which the applicant contended. 
87The decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 has been the subject of considerable discussion by this Court: see DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159. Although in the present case the sentencing judge referred to the ""benchmark"" head sentence I am satisfied that his Honour was intending to express the view that the standard non-parole period was a relevant benchmark. As the High Court made plain in Muldrock both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period remain relevant to the sentencing exercise.
88In the present case his Honour may have commenced with the assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness and proceeded to ask himself whether for any reason a lesser or greater period without parole was appropriate. If his remarks are understood in this manner then the sentencing is infected by the error identified in Muldrock.
89In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said:
""According to s 21A, the factors of aggravation in an objective sense present in the offences were that substantial injury and emotional harm were caused to the boy; and that he was very young: even though all victims of the subject offence are young, he was young in the sense that the exploitation of his vulnerability was of a high degree.""
90There was evidence from the complainant's mother that the complainant had suffered a significant degree of emotional harm. Accordingly, this factual finding was open to his Honour. Furthermore, he was very young. In MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at [22] this Court (Kirby J; Grove and Hislop JJ agreeing) said that the age of a victim is unquestionably an important consideration in determining the objective seriousness of a crime, saying that ""no doubt, as a generalisation, the younger the child the more defenceless and vulnerable."" 
91It is plain that when sentencing the applicant his Honour was required to bear the complainant's young age in mind when considering the objective seriousness of the offence. His Honour did this and in my opinion no error has been established.
92The sentencing judge considered a report from a consulting psychologist, Mr Taylor who concluded that by reason of the applicant's general stability in life and his general respect for the law that, although he denied his guilt, he was a low to moderate risk of re-offending. The trial judge rejected this evidence and said:
""The only sensible conclusion, it seems to me, is that no prognostication can be made with any degree of confidence. If any observer of the prisoner, on what is known to the court, had been asked to prognosticate the day before this offence occurred whether the prisoner was likely to commit an offence of such seriousness, the prospect would have been dismissed as absurd. He has however committed these offences. One of them is very serious. He was close to his own son, a small boy. He would be acutely aware of how vulnerable a small boy is, and despite conviction at the hands of a careful jury, he is unable, it seems to admit his guilt. He may come to admit his guilt, he may come to get proper treatment, but there is no reason to think any of those things are especially likely.""
93It is plain that the sentencing judge was entitled to reject the psychologist's opinion. The factual foundation for its rejection was open to him. There is no error on this count.
94I am persuaded that apart from the failure to impose a non-parole period for count 1 the sentence which his Honour imposed was manifestly excessive. To my mind, this will be explained either by a ""Way"" error R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 or by the fact that his Honour has placed excessive emphasis upon the standard non-parole period giving it a significance that the particular offence and the circumstances of the applicant did not justify. 
95At the time the offences were committed the applicant was only 20 years of age. He was a person of prior good character. He will, by reason of the nature of his offences, be required to serve at least a proportion of his sentence in protective custody. 
96Furthermore, the offences were of short duration and occurred in immediate succession effectively as part of one continuous act. The offences were opportunistic. There was no suggestion that the complainant was groomed by the applicant or that there was anything other than limited forethought by him. The offences were committed without accompanying threats or intimidating behaviour.
97There is no doubt that the offences were serious. However, the range of offending contemplated by the relevant statutory provision includes offences of far greater criminality that the present offences. Nevertheless both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period remain important guide posts when sentencing.
98It is the case that the applicant was required to be sentenced after trial and accordingly was not entitled to any discount by reason of a plea of guilty. However, he will require careful supervision following his release and to assist in his rehabilitation. That need is such as to justify a finding of special circumstances.
Orders:
1. Leave to appeal against conviction granted and the appeal dismissed.2. With respect to sentence leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is upheld and the sentences imposed in the court below are quashed and the applicant is resentenced as follows:
(a) in relation to count 1 sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 12 November 2010 and expiring on 11 November 2013 with a further term of 2 years to expire on 11 November 2015.
(b) in relation to count 2 sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 12 November 2010 and expiring on 11 November 2018 with a further term of 4 years expiring on 11 November 2022.
99R A HULME J:  I agree with the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and with the orders he proposes.  
100I wish to say something further about grounds 6 and 7 in the appeal against conviction.
101Ground 6 is succinctly stated:  ""The jury's verdicts were inconsistent"".  The statement of the ground in that form does not invoke any basis upon which this Court could allow an appeal against conviction and set aside verdicts of a jury pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912:
(1)  The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice ...
102In reality, the contention of the applicant was to the effect that the verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 1 and 2 are unreasonable having regard to the inability of the jury to reach a verdict on count 3, when the Crown relied so heavily in respect of all three counts upon the evidence of a single witness.  The principles concerning how this Court must approach the determination of a contention that a verdict is unreasonable have been referred to in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [48].
103I agree that the outcome in relation to count 3 provided no basis to infer that there was any doubt about the truthfulness of the complainant that should have given rise to a reasonable doubt about the applicant's guilt in respect of counts 1 and 2. 
104Aside from the possible explanations for the different result in respect of count 3 that McClellan CJ at CL has referred to in his judgment (at [44] - [45]), I consider it possible that the quality and detail of the evidence of the complainant provides a further explanation.
105The complainant gave evidence that while he was sitting on the lounge the applicant ""started playing with my noodle"".  He then gave the following account:
Q. O.K.  So were his hands on the outside of your clothes, on the inside of your clothes or something else?A. Outside.
Q. O.K.A. Well, yeah, inside I think.
Q. O.K.  And then what happened?A. Nothing.  (Emphasis added) (AB 125)
106The learned trial judge reminded the jury of this passage of the complainant's evidence in his summing up (AB 47).
107Then there was the fact that the complainant's account of the incident with which count 3 was concerned contained little detail.  That is not a criticism; it was a simple, short-lived and relatively straightforward incident to describe.  
108Having regard to these matters, with the jury separately considering count 3 as they were directed to do in what was essentially a word against word case, it is unremarkable that some jurors were not prepared to find that the heavy burden of proof placed upon the Crown had been satisfied.
109The complainant's description of the events with which counts 1 and 2 were concerned, and most particularly the latter, was in stark contrast.  There was a significant amount of graphic detail in his account; the penetration feeling ""like a shark attack"" and matters of that nature to which McClellan CJ at CL has referred in his judgment (at [78]). 
110There was also the support derived from the evidence of Dr Marks for the complainant's reliability.  I have put to one side her evidence concerning the constipation issue.  But the complainant's version included that in the immediate aftermath ""it was like little bits of poos coming out, ""cause he, he made it like come out"" (AB 121). He said that it was not blood but ""just like a bit of poo, like green, probably brown"" (AB 122).  Dr Marks was asked about the complainant having experienced an anal discharge and she said:
""If there had been ejaculation it could be the fluid from that or, also after an assault there may have been some initial loss of tone and leakage of normal bowel content"". (AB 541)
111She was asked about the complainant's account of the colour of the discharge:
""My understanding is that ... could be fluid, if there had been ejaculation, and the fluid would become stained with the faecal material.  So that fluid would then end up being that colour"". (AB 542)
112Whilst there was a strident challenge to Dr Marks' evidence on matters relating to the constipation issue, there was no cross-examination at all as to the above matters.
113The description of the incidents in counts 1 and 2 and of what occurred as a result, coming from a boy who was aged six at the time and eight at the time of trial, must have impressed the jury to the point that they were satisfied of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The description of the count 3 was less likely to have inspired such confidence, not because of any doubt about his truthfulness, but only because of the lesser degree of detail.
114I am not persuaded that the verdicts are unreasonable, either because of the quality of the evidence or because of the inability of the jury to return a verdict on count 3.  For myself, I have no doubt about the applicant's guilt in respect of counts 1 and 2.
115SCHMIDT J:  I agree with the orders which McClellan CJ at CL proposes in relation to both the conviction and sentence appeals and with his Honour's reasons.

		23 January 2013",2012-12-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
11492,2760365,Police v DG [2012] NSWChC 18,"Judgment

1The Young Person, DG, was charged with the offence of larceny. It is alleged that on 22 September 2011, he stole property to the value of $500. The matter was listed for hearing before the Children's Court of NSW on 27 September 2012. The Young Person maintained his plea of 'Not Guilty' and the Prosecution sought to withdraw the charge.

2Objection was taken to the withdrawal of the charge by the Young Person's legal representative. It was submitted that the Court should exercise its ""common law discretion to refuse to allow the Prosecution to withdraw the matter"". The effect would be that the Prosecution would be required to ""offer no evidence"" and that the matter would be dismissed by the Court. It was not submitted that the withdrawal of the charge would be an abuse of process, but rather that it would be unfair to the Young Person if he was to be exposed to the possibility of having to face the same allegation at a later time. The Defence submitted that the Supreme Court case of Evans v DPP [2000] NSWSC 1005, provided authority for the Defence submission.

3The Prosecution indicated that it sought to withdraw the proceedings pursuant to s 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986; and did not seek to ""offer no evidence"".

4The case of Evans v DPP related to a criminal matter which had already commenced as a hearing, in the sense that some evidence had been heard before the Local Court. It was also a matter that attracted the procedural provisions of the Justices Act 1902. The Justices Act has now been repealed and largely replaced by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
In Evans v DPP, his Honour, Justice James noted at paragraph 45:

""Although the power to give leave to an informant to withdraw an information still exists, where a hearing of the information has commenced, a magistrate may be less likely to exercise the discretionary power in favour of the informant, if the hearing of the information has commenced. If the hearing has commenced and it has become apparent that the evidence of the prosecution is incapable of establishing the offence charged and if the defendant opposes the giving of leave to withdraw the information, then a proper exercise of the magistrate's discretion may require the magistrate to refuse to give leave to the informant to withdraw the information. A defendant may oppose the giving of leave to withdraw the information, because the defendant wishes to obtain the benefit of an order of the magistrate dismissing the information, which would in turn empower the magistrate to make an order for costs in favour of the defendant.""

5In Lay v Cleary and Anor (1992) BC9303691, the charges against Mr Lay were withdrawn by consent. (It would appear that the Prosecutor was not prepared to ""offer no evidence"" as the complainant was available but unreliable and reluctant to give evidence). After the proceedings were withdrawn, counsel for the accused sought a costs order from the Court. The magistrate refused the application, indicating that the Court had no power under the provisions of the Justices Act 1902, if the matter had been withdrawn, rather than dismissed.

Section 80 of the Justices Act 1902 at that time stated:

""After hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and the evidence adduced, the said Justice or Justices shall consider and determine the whole matter, and convict or, make an order upon the defendant or dismiss the information or complaint, as the case may require.""

Section 81, stated:
"".....that a Justice in the case of an order of dismissal may order that the prosecutor pay to the Clerk of the Court to be paid by him to the defendant such costs as to the Justice seem just and reasonable.""

6It would appear that the issue of whether or not a Magistrate had an implied discretion arose as there was ""no power expressly conferred by the Justices Act to give leave to an informant to withdraw an information. On the contrary, a Justice when exercising summary jurisdiction is required by s77 and s 80 of the Justices Act where both parties appear and there is no question of any adjournment, to hear and determine the matter and either to convict the defendant or dismiss the information."" (Lay v Cleary at page 19.)

7At pages 23 and 24 of his Honour's judgment in Lay v Cleary refers to the following:

""A power in a Magistrate to give leave to an informant to withdraw proceedings, although not expressly conferred by statute, has been recognised in England. In Regina v Phipps, which I have already referred to, the facts bear a strong resemblance to the facts in the present case. Lord Parker CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed said: ""...it is common knowledge that process is allowed to be withdrawn in many cases where the prosecution do not desire to proceed, and in my judgment where withdrawal in that sense takes place, that is to say where the prosecution is allowed to withdraw process before, in the case of a trial, the trial is started, and in the case of an inquiry, before the inquiry has begun, there is then no provision in the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1952, which will enable the accused to recover costs. Having said that, I would like to add that the position is not as bad as it would at first appear, because it is always a matter for the discretion of the court whether it allows the process to be withdrawn. There are a number of factors which would enter into the consideration preceding the exercise of the discretion. There would, in the case of a summary trial, be questions such as: are all the defendant's witnesses here? Is the nature of the offence such that the defendant should be acquitted, which will prevent further proceedings being brought, whereas a discretion to allow process to be withdrawn will not amount to an acquittal? There is also the consideration, arising from what I have said, that the defendant may have incurred costs and desire to recover those costs, or have an opportunity of recovering those costs which he will not have if the summons is withdrawn.""

8After considering a number of authorities, his Honour Justice James stated at paragraph 30 of his judgment:

""I conclude that a Justice has an implied discretionary power to grant leave to an informant to withdraw an information charging an offence punishable summarily, at least where the informant applies for leave to withdraw the information before any hearing has commenced.

I do not consider that it is unjust to a defendant for a Magistrate to have such a power. If an application for leave to withdraw an information is made to a Magistrate, the Magistrate should ask the defendant whether he consents or objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information. It is open to the defendant to tell the Magistrate that he objects to leave being given. If the defendant tells the Magistrate that he objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information, that will be a very material factor for the Magistrate to take into account in deciding whether to exercise his discretionary power in favour of giving leave to the informant to withdraw the information. If the defendant objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information and particularly if the defendant says that he wishes to apply for an order for costs, the Magistrate must take into account that if he grants leave to the informant to withdraw the information, the Magistrate will have no power to make an order for costs in favour of the defendant.

The granting of leave to an informant to withdraw an information will not necessarily be inimical to the interests of the defendant. A defendant who thinks that he is at some risk of being convicted if there is a hearing, may prefer to have the information withdrawn, even though he does not obtain an acquittal and cannot obtain an order for payment of his costs. If the information is withdrawn the risk of his being convicted on that information is eliminated and it may be practically certain that no further information will be laid. If the defendant objects to leave being given to withdraw the information, there may be a risk from the defendant's point of view that the informant will prefer to proceed and endeavour to obtain a conviction, rather than offer no evidence and incur an order for costs.""

9In the present case, this Court has proceeded on the basis that the argument raised by the Defence did not seek to raise future issues in relation autrefois acquit, but simply that it would be unfair if the Young Person's matter was not determined to finality at this time.

Under the Justices Act, the withdrawal of an information did not involve an order of dismissal of the information and a fresh charge for the same offence may have been open to the prosecuting authorities. A number of authorities have addressed these issues. See Broome v Chenoweth 1946, HCA, BC4600060, Willis v Magistrates' Court of Victoria, 1995, BC9606097, DG of Fair Trading v O'Shane 1996, BC9703791, Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Au, [2005] NSWCA 119.

10It would appear that whilst the Defence argument may be somewhat beguiling, it does not properly state the current applicable statute law.

11Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 deals with 'Summary Procedure'.

Section 170 applies ""to or in respect of proceedings for summary offences, including proceedings for indictable offences that are being dealt with summarily."" The charge against the Young Person falls within this definition of an indictable offence being dealt with summarily. Proceedings are now commenced ""by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice"".

12Part 2, Division 3 deals with Trial Procedure in the Local Court. 
Section 192(1) states that:

""If both the accused person and the prosecutor are present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of proceedings for an offence (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned) the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter"".

Subsection 3 provides for an adjournment of the proceedings, if appropriate.

13Section 202(1) states:

""The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act.""

14Section 205 states:

(1) ""A court may make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if it decides to dismiss the matter.
(2) ""A court must make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a mater has been dismissed if requested to do so by an accused person against whom a matter has been dismissed or by the prosecutor.""
(3) ""This section does not apply to a matter that is taken to be dismissed because of s 208.""

15Section 206 states:

""A certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed, if produced and without any further proofs being required, prevents any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.""

16Section 208 states:

(1) ""If a matter is withdrawn by the prosecutor, the matter is taken to be dismissed and the accused person is taken to be discharged in relation to the offences concerned.""
(2) ""The dismissal of a matter because of its withdrawal by the prosecutor does not prevent any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.""

17It appears that there was no equivalent provision to s 208 in the repealed Justices Act.

The legislative intent of s 208 appears to have been to provide a statutory basis for the withdrawal of matters by the prosecution, rather than an implied discretion to allow the withdrawal of a matter, as had been the case implied under the Justices Act and interpreted by case law.

The purposive use of the words ""taken to be dismissed"" and ""taken to be discharged"" suggests that this section does not require the court to exercise any discretion to effectively dismiss the matter. The withdrawal of the matter deems that to have occurred on the withdrawal by the prosecutor.

18In DPP (NSW) v AB [2008] NSWSC 115, his Honour Justice Adams stated:

""It is clear that s208 specifies a mandatory course in the event of the withdrawal of a matter by a prosecutor. The deemed dismissal of the charge and discharge of the accused person in relation to the alleged offence occurs by virtue of the section. Further action by the Magistrate or the court is unnecessary and can add nothing to the effect of the withdrawal."" Para 11.

19The Second Reading Speech relating to ss 205, 206 and 208 on 7 November 2007, contains the following statement by the Hon. Penny Sharpe:

""I deal firstly with the issue of double jeopardy raised by Ms Lee Rhiannon. The amendments merely clarify that the withdrawal of the matter by the prosecution does not prevent later proceedings in respect of the same matter against the same person. The double jeopardy principle has never been intended to apply to such matters; it being predicated upon there being an acquittal, generally following a hearing on the merits of the case...The concern arising from these sections is that matters can be withdrawn for technical reasons unrelated to the prosecution forming the view that the prosecution is doomed to fail. This amendment does not affect the other safeguards in the law such as applications for stays due to unfairness; statutes of limitations for bringing summary offences, generally six months,; and arguments relating to abuse of process, all of which continue to ensure that this particular provision is not unfairly misused.""

20The other issue that caused considerable consternation under the Justices Act, related to the issue of costs. As referred to above, if the matter was withdrawn but not dismissed, a costs remedy was not available to the accused.

21Sections 212 and 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act remove any concern that costs are not available if the prosecution withdraws a charge pursuant to s 208.

Section 212 states:
212(1) A court may award costs in criminal proceedings only in accordance with this Act.

Section 213 states:
213 (1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.
213 (2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.
213 (3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because:
(a)the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or
(b)the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.
Professional costs are defined in s 211 as meaning ""costs (other than court costs) relating to professional expenses and disbursements (including witnesses' expenses in respect of proceedings before a court.""

22The Criminal Procedure Act does not specifically allude to the situation where the prosecution concedes that they cannot proceed as their case is ""doomed"" and they therefore seek to ""offer no evidence."" In Broome v Chenoweth, (1946) HCA, BC4600060, Justice Dixon referred to a matter where the prosecution had unsuccessfully sought to have the matter withdrawn and where no evidence was offered and the papers marked ""Dismissal for want of prosecution"". His Honour continued, noting:

""What is material is that defects existed in the information which made the prosecutor unwilling to proceed and that the ground of the dismissal was his failure further to prosecute it. The expression in the minute ""want of prosecution"" was used to mean the failure of the informant to support the information though appearing before the court, not his failure to appear. It is not an expression with any distinct meaning or consequences in proceedings before justices. It is not a term of art or a recognised form of judgment, like a judgment of nonsuit, of non pros, or a judgment after a nolle prosequi before verdict, well understood at common law to amount to a termination of proceedings without an adjudication and creating no bar to a subsequent suit. There is, therefore, nothing in the terms in which the minute is framed to prevent the order of the magistrate operating as such a discharge of the defendant from the earlier information as to bar any subsequent proceedings for the same offence.""

23An analogous situation to the above under the Criminal Procedure Act would be one where the prosecution proceeds pursuant to s 202, rather than s 208. If the prosecution proceeded under s 202, conceding that it could not succeed at any time, the Court could grant a certificate pursuant to ss 205 and 206.

The construction of s 205 would appear to require the court to provide a certificate if the court ""decides to dismiss the matter."" This could encapsulate a matter where the prosecution conceded that their case must fail; and the matter is dismissed prior to hearing.

The certificate must be granted if requested by either the accused person or by the prosecutor. Such a certificate would make it clear that no further proceedings could be brought by the prosecution. (See s 206).

24A different interpretation to paragraphs 22 and 23 above, may be interpreted from the case AB v DPP (NSW) and ANOR [2008] NSWCA 91; where his Honour Justice Handley stated at paragraph 10 and 11, (referring to s 202 (1) and (2)):

""This indicates the nature of the order of dismissal referred to in s 205 (1). In the present case the Children's Court did not make ""an order of dismissal"" and did not ""decided to dismiss the matter. There was no trial, no evidence and no adjudication.

A dismissal under s 208 does not flow from any order or decision of the court. It takes effect automatically on the withdrawal of the case by the prosecutor.""

25In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Au [2005] NSWCA 119, the Court of Appeal considered a matter which was originally before the Local Court and dismissed by consent under the Justices Act. The matter was appealed to the Supreme Court before his Honour Justice Shaw who determined that there had been a 'hearing' as he considered that ""although...there had been no hearing on the merits because the procedural course taken was by consent. He considered that as the parties had appeared with their legal representatives and put to the Magistrate what they desired to do and say, that was sufficient to constitute a hearing and the fact that no witnesses were called was legally irrelevant.""

26The need for a hearing relates specifically to the issue of issue estoppel or autrefois acquit. For a plea of autrefois acquit to succeed there must have been an acquittal on the merits. The accused person must have been ""put in jeopardy on the prior (earlier) charge"". This may require further clarification by a superior court or by legislative amendment.

27The question whether the matter is dealt with pursuant to s 202 in terms of ""offering no evidence"" and s 208, where the matter is withdrawn, may rely on the prosecutor's discretion. Both provisions empower the court to award costs against the prosecutor, as referred to above.

Clearly, the Second Reading Speech made it clear that other safeguards available to the court ""such as applications for stays due to unfairness"" are not affected by the amendments to the Act.

28The defence submission in this case relied on the implied jurisdiction arising from the Local Courts Act and referred to in cases such as Lay v Cleary. With the provisions referred to above, particularly s 208, the Local Court and the Children's Court have been provided with an express jurisdiction arising from the statute known as the Criminal Procedure Act.

The court retains an implied jurisdiction which ""will arise upon the principle that a grant of express power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise. Recognition of the existence of implied powers is called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a jurisdiction which is expressly conferred but are confined to so much as can be derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction."" See Director-General of Fair Trading v O'Shane, 1996, NSWSC, BC9703791.

29In DPP (NSW) v AB [2008]NSWSC 115, Justice Adams commented at paragraphs 15 and 16:

""the effect of s 208 is to render any decision by the Magistrate supererogatory and, indeed, was outside the Court's jurisdiction. To my mind, the better interpretation of what the Magistrate did was simply to note the papers with the effect of s 208 so it would be clear, if anyone needed to consider the papers, that the matter had been dismissed.......it is obviously desirable that, where magistrates do note a dismissal and discharge pursuant to a withdrawal, the papers specifically refer to s 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 so that any officer of the court who finds it necessary to consult the papers will understand immediately what the actual position was.""

30The Prosecution are entitled to withdraw the larceny charge against the Young Person.

That charge is taken to be dismissed and the young person is taken to be discharged in relation to that charge.

31An application for costs was made and not opposed by the prosecution. Costs in the sum of $825 are awarded, pursuant to s 213.

                   Respondent was charged with unlawful possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, but was convicted only of unlawful possession. After the trial
judge made a finding that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was
in possession of a narcotic, respondent brought a motion challenging the
constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. That
section provides that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, the accused is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of
trafficking and that, absent the accused's establishing the contrary, he must
be convicted of trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal, on an appeal brought
by the Crown, found that this provision constituted a ""reverse onus""
clause and held it to be unconstitutional because it violated the presumption
of innocence now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown appealed and a constitutional question was
stated as to whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violated s.
11 (d) of the Charter  and was therefore of no force and effect.
Inherent in this question, given a finding that s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
had been violated, was the issue of whether or not s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act was a reasonable limit prescribed by law and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed and the constitutional question answered in the affirmative.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Chouinard, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: Pursuant to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the accused, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of
possession of a narcotic, has the legal burden of proving on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. On proof of possession, a mandatory presumption arises against the
accused that he intended to traffic and the accused will be found guilty unless
he can rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

 

                   The presumption of innocence lies at the very heart
of the criminal law and is protected expressly by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
and inferentially by the s. 7  right to life, liberty and security of the
person. This presumption has enjoyed longstanding recognition at common law and
has gained widespread acceptance as evidenced from its inclusion in major
international human rights documents. In light of these sources, the right to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty requires, at a minimum, that: (1) an
individual be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the State must bear
the burden of proof; and (3) criminal prosecutions must be carried out in
accordance with lawful procedures and fairness.

 

                   A provision which requires an accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an
important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d). The fact that the standard required on rebuttal
is only a balance of probabilities does not render a reverse onus clause
constitutional.

 

                   Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
infringes the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
by requiring the accused to prove he is not guilty of trafficking once the
basic fact of possession is proven.

 

                   The rational connection test ‑‑ the
potential for a rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed
fact to justify a reverse onus provision ‑‑ does not apply to the
interpretation of s. 11 (d). A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a
presumed fact, but still not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt,
which is an important aspect of the presumption of innocence. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test is under s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Section 1  of the Charter  has two functions:
First, it guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which
follow it; and second, it states explicitly the exclusive justificatory
criteria (outside of s. 33 of the Constitutional Act, 1982) against
which limitations on those rights and freedoms may be measured.

 

                   The onus of proving that a limitation on any Charter 
right is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society
rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation. Limits on
constitutionally guaranteed rights are clearly exceptions to the general
guarantee. The presumption is that Charter  rights are guaranteed unless
the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the exceptional criteria
justifying their being limited.

 

                   The standard of proof under s. 1  is a preponderance
of probabilities. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt would be unduly onerous on
the party seeking to limit the right because concepts such as
""reasonableness"", ""justifiability"", and ""free and
democratic society"" are not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the
preponderance of probability test must be applied rigorously.

 

                   Two central criteria must be satisfied to establish
that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. First, the objective to be served by the measures limiting a Charter 
right must be sufficiently important to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right or freedom. The standard must be high to ensure that trivial
objectives or those discordant with the principles of a free and democratic
society do not gain protection. At a minimum, an objective must relate to
societal concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic
society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important. Second, the
party invoking s. 1  must show the means to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified. This involves a form of proportionality test involving three
important components. To begin, the measures must be fair and not arbitrary,
carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally
connected to that objective. In addition, the means should impair the right in
question as little as possible. Lastly, there must be a proportion­ality
between the effects of the limiting measure and the objective ‑‑
the more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the more important the
objective must be. 

 

                   Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased was substantial and pressing. Its objective of protecting society
from the grave ills of drug trafficking was self‑evident, for the
purposes of s. 1 , and could potentially in certain cases warrant the overriding
of a constitutionally protected right. There was, however, no rational
connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact of
possession for the purpose of trafficking. The possession of a small or
negligible quantity of narcotics would not support the inference of
trafficking.

 

                   Per Estey and McIntyre
JJ.: Concurred in the reasons of Dickson C.J. with respect to the relationship
between s. 11 (d) and s. 1  of the Charter  but the reasons of
Martin J.A. in the court below were adopted for the disposition of all other
issues.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This appeal concerns the constitutionality of
s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. The section
provides, in brief, that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, he is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking.
Unless the accused can establish the contrary, he must be convicted of
trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this provision constitutes a
""reverse onus"" clause and is unconstitutional because it violates one
of the core values of our criminal justice system, the presumption of
innocence, now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown has appealed.

Statutory and Constitutional Provisions

 

2.                Before reviewing the factual context, I
will set out the relevant legislative and constitutional provisions:

 

Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1.

 

                   3. (1) Except as authorized by this Act or the regulations, no person
shall have a narcotic in his possession.

 

                   (2) Every
person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable

 

(a) upon summary
conviction for a first offence, to a fine of one thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both fine and imprisonment, and for a
subsequent offence, to a fine of two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for
one year or to both fine and imprisonment; or

 

(b) upon
conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for seven years.

 

                   4. (1) No person shall traffic in a narcotic or any substance represented
or held out by him to be a narcotic.

 

                   (2) No
person shall have in his possession a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.

 

                   (3) Every
person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   8. In any prosecution for a violation of subsection 4(2), if the
accused does not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if it were a
prosecution for an offence under section 3, and after the close of the case
for the prosecution and after the accused has had an opportunity to make full
answer and defence, the court shall make a finding as to whether or not the
accused was in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3; if the
court finds that the accused was not in possession of the narcotic contrary to
section 3, he shall be acquitted but if the court finds that the accused was
in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3, he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an
opportunity of adducing evidence to establish that the accused was in possession
of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking; if the accused establishes
that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
he shall be acquitted of the offence as charged but he shall be convicted
of an offence under section 3 and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged and
sentenced accordingly.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.

Facts

 

3.                The respondent, David Edwin Oakes, was
charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. He elected trial by
magistrate without a jury. At trial, the Crown adduced evidence to establish
that Mr. Oakes was found in possession of eight one gram vials of cannabis
resin in the form of hashish oil. Upon a further search conducted at the police
station, $619.45 was located. Mr. Oakes told the police that he had bought ten
vials of hashish oil for $150 for his own use, and that the $619.45 was from a
workers' compensation cheque. He elected not to call evidence as to possession
of the narcotic. Pursuant to the procedural provisions of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the trial judge proceeded to make a finding that it was beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Oakes was in possession of the narcotic. 

 

4.                Following this finding, Mr. Oakes
brought a motion to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, which he maintained imposes a burden on an accused to prove
that he or she was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He argued
that s. 8 violates the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of
the Charter .

Judgments

 

(a) Ontario Provincial Court (R. v. Oakes (1982), 38
O.R. (2d) 598)

 

5.                At trial, Walker Prov. Ct. J. borrowed
the words of Laskin C.J. in R. v. Shelley, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, at p.
202, and found there was no rational or necessary connection between the fact
proved, i.e., possession of the drug, and the conclusion asked to be
drawn, namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking. Walker Prov. Ct. J.
held that, to the extent that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act requires
this presumption and the resultant conviction, it is inoperative as a violation
of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

6.                Walker Prov. Ct. J. added that the
reverse onus in s. 8 would not be invalid if the Crown had adduced evidence of
possession as well as evidence from which it could be inferred beyond a
reasonable doubt that the possession was for the purpose of trafficking. If
this were done, there would be a sufficient rational connection between the
fact of possession and the presumed fact of trafficking.

 

(b)Ontario Court of Appeal (R. v. Oakes (1983), 145
D.L.R. (3d) 123)

 

7.                Martin J.A., writing for a unanimous
court, dismissed the appeal and held the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act unconstitutional.

 

8.                Martin J.A. stated that, as a general
rule, a reverse onus clause which places a burden on the accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence contravenes the
right to be presumed innocent. Nevertheless, he held that some reverse onus
provisions may be constitutionally valid provided they constitute reasonable
limitations on the right to be presumed innocent and are demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society. 

 

9.                To determine whether a particular
reverse onus provision is legitimate, Martin J.A. outlined a two‑pronged
inquiry. First, it is necessary to pass a threshold test which he explained as
follows, at p. 146:

 

                   The
threshold question in determining the legitimacy of a particular reverse onus
provision is whether the reverse onus clause is justifiable in the sense that
it is reasonable for Parliament to place the burden of proof on the accused in
relation to an ingredient of the offence in question. In determining the
threshold question consideration should be given to a number of factors,
including such factors as: (a) the magnitude of the evil sought to be
suppressed, which may be measured by the gravity of the harm resulting from the
offence or by the frequency of the occurrence of the offence or by both
criteria; (b) the difficulty of the prosecution making proof of the presumed
fact, and (c) the relative ease with which the accused may prove or disprove
the presumed fact. Manifestly, a reverse onus provision placing the burden of
proof on the accused with respect to a fact which it is not rationally open to
him to prove or disprove cannot be justified.

 

10.              If the reverse onus provision meets these
criteria, due regard having been given to Parliament's assessment of the need
for the provision, a second test must then be satisfied. This second test was
described by Martin J.A. as the ""rational connection test"". According
to it, to be reasonable, the proven fact (e.g., possession) must
rationally tend to prove the presumed fact (e.g., an intention to
traffic). In other words, the proven fact must raise a probability that the
presumed fact exists.

 

11.              In considering s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, Martin J.A. focused primarily on the second test at p. 147:

 

                   I have
reached the conclusion that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is
constitutionally invalid because of the lack of a rational connection between
the proved fact (possession) and the presumed fact (an intention to
traffic).... Mere possession of a small quantity of a narcotic drug does not
support an inference of possession for the purpose of trafficking or even tend
to prove an intent to traffic. Moreover, upon proof of possession, s. 8 casts
upon the accused the burden of disproving not some formal element of the
offence but the burden of disproving the very essence of the offence.

 

12.              Martin J.A. added that it is not for
courts to attempt to rewrite s. 8 by applying it on a case by case basis.
Furthermore, where a rational connection does exist between possession and the
presumed intention to traffic, such as ""where the possession of a narcotic
drug is of such a nature as to be indicative of trafficking, the common sense
of a jury can ordinarily be relied upon to arrive at a proper conclusion"".
There would not, therefore, be any need for a statutory presumption.

 

13.              One final note should be made regarding
Martin J.A.'s judgment. In assessing whether or not s. 8 was a reasonable
limitation on the constitutional protection of the presumption of innocence,
Martin J.A. combined the analysis of s. 11 (d) with s. 1 . He held that
the requirements of s. 1 , that a limitation be reasonable and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society, provided the standard for
interpreting the phrase ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d). 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Issues

 

14.              The constitutional question in this appeal
is stated as follows:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Two specific questions are raised by this general question: (1) does s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter ;
and, (2) if it does, is s. 8  a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 
of the Charter ? If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to
(2) negative, then the constitutional question must be answered in the
affirmative.

 

                                                                    V

 

Does s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act Violate s. 11(d)
of the Charter ?

 

(a) The Meaning of s. 8

 

15.              Before examining the presumption of
innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it is necessary
to clarify the meaning of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. The
procedural steps contemplated by s. 8  were clearly outlined by Branca J.A. in R.
v. Babcock and Auld, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 235 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 247:

 

                   (A) The
accused is charged with possession of a forbidden drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (B) The
trial of the accused on this charge then proceeds as if it was a prosecution
against the accused on a simple charge of possession of the forbidden drug....

 

                   (C)
When the Crown has adduced its evidence on the basis that the charge was a
prosecution for simple possession, the accused is then given the statutory
right or opportunity of making a full answer and defence to the charge of
simple possession....

 

                   (D)
When this has been done the Court must make a finding as to whether the accused
was in possession of narcotics contrary to s. 3 of the new Act. (Unlawful
possession of a forbidden narcotic drug).

 

                   (E)
Assuming that the Court so finds, it is then that an onus is placed upon the
accused in the sense that an opportunity must be given to the accused of
establishing that he was not in possession of a narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (F)
When the accused has been given this opportunity the prosecutor may then
establish that the possession of the accused was for the purpose of
trafficking....

 

                   (G) It
is then that the Court must find whether or not the accused has discharged the
onus placed upon him under and by the said section.

 

                   (H) If
the Court so finds, the accused must be acquitted of the offence as charged,
namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking, but in that event the
accused must be convicted of the simple charge of unlawful possession of a
forbidden narcotic....

 

                   (I) If
the accused does not so establish he must then be convicted of the full offence
as charged. 

 

 

Mr. Justice Branca then added at pp. 247‑48:

 

                   It is
quite clear to me that under s. 8 of the new Act the trial must be divided into
two phases. In the first phase the sole issue to be determined is whether or
not the accused is guilty of simple possession of a narcotic. This issue is to
be determined upon evidence relevant only to the issue of possession. In the
second phase the question to be resolved is whether or not the possession
charged is for the purpose of trafficking.

 

16.              Against the backdrop of these procedural
steps, we must consider the nature of the statutory presumption contained in s.
8 and the type of burden it places on an accused. The relevant portions of
s. 8 read:

 

                   8. ...if the court finds that the accused was in possession of the
narcotic ... he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he was not
in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking ... if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged....

 

17.              In determining the meaning of these words,
it is helpful to consider in a general sense the nature of presumptions.
Presumptions can be classified into two general categories: presumptions without
basic facts and presumptions with basic facts. A presumption without a
basic fact is simply a conclusion which is to be drawn until the contrary is
proved. A presumption with a basic fact entails a conclusion to be drawn upon
proof of the basic fact (see Cross on Evidence, 5th ed., at pp. 122‑23).

 

18.              Basic fact presumptions can be further
categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions. A permissive
presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact
is drawn following proof of the basic fact. A mandatory presumption requires
that the inference be made.

 

19.              Presumptions may also be either rebuttable
or irrebuttable. If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways
the presumed fact can be rebutted. First, the accused may be required merely to
raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence. Secondly, the accused may have an
evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the
truth of the presumed fact. Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or persuasive
burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non‑existence of the presumed
fact.

 

20.              Finally, presumptions are often referred
to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact. The latter entail
""frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence"" (Cross
on Evidence, supra, at p. 124) while the former involve actual legal
rules.

 

21.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, it is my view that, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt
of possession of a narcotic, the accused has the legal burden of proving on a
balance of probabilities that he or she was not in possession of the narcotic
for the purpose of trafficking. Once the basic fact of possession is proven, a
mandatory presumption of law arises against the accused that he or she had the
intention to traffic. Moreover, the accused will be found guilty of the offence
of trafficking unless he or she can rebut this presumption on a balance of
probabilities. This interpretation of s. 8 is supported by the courts in a
number of jurisdictions: R. v. Carroll (1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 92
(P.E.I.S.C. in banco); R. v. Cook (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 419
(N.S.C.A.); R. v. O’Day (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (N.B.C.A.); R. v.
Landry (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Stanger (1983),
7 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Alta. C.A.) 

 

22.              In some decisions it has been held that s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is constitutional because it places only
an evidentiary burden rather than a legal burden on the accused. The ultimate
legal burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the Crown
and the presumption of innocence is not offended. (R. v. Therrien
(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 31 (Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Fraser (1982), 138
D.L.R. (3d) 488 (Sask. Q.B.); R. v. Kupczyniski, (June 23, 1982,
unreported, Ont. Co. Ct.))

 

23.              This same approach was relied on in R.
v. Sharpe (1961), 131 C.C.C. 75 (Ont. C.A.), a Canadian Bill of Rights
decision on the presumption of innocence. In that case, a provision in the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, similar to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, was interpreted as shifting merely the secondary burden of
adducing evidence onto the accused. The primary onus remained with the Crown.
In R. v. Silk, [1970] 3 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (B.C.C.A.), the British Columbia
Court of Appeal held that s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
had not been infringed because s. 33  of the Food and Drugs Act , (now
R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27, s. 35) required only that an accused raise a
reasonable doubt that the purpose of his or her possession was trafficking.
This decision, however, was not followed in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R.
303, nor in R. v. Erdman (1971), 24 C.R.N.S. 216 (B.C.C.A.)

 

24.              Those decisions which have held that only
the secondary or evidentiary burden shifts are not persuasive with respect to
the Narcotic Control Act. As Ritchie J. found in R. v. Appleby, supra,
(though addressing a different statutory provision) the phrase ""to
establish"" is the equivalent of ""to prove"". The legislature, by using
the word ""establish"" in s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
intended to impose a legal burden on the accused. This is most apparent in the
words ""if the accused fails to establish that he was not in possession of
the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the
offence as charged"".

 

25.              In the Appleby case, Ritchie J.
also held that the accused is required to disprove the presumed fact according
to the civil standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities. He rejected the
criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, relying, inter alia,
upon the following passage from the House of Lords' decision in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj, [1970] 2 W.L.R. 226, at p. 232: 

 

                   Generally
speaking, no onus lies upon a defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or
disprove any fact: it is sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts
which, if they existed, would constitute the offence with which he is charged
are ""not proved"". But exceptionally, as in the present case, an
enactment creating an offence expressly provides that if other facts are
proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a necessary factual
ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to exist ""unless
the contrary is proved"". In such a case the consequence of finding that
that particular fact is ""disproved"" will be an acquittal, whereas the
absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction. Where this
is the consequence of a fact's being ""disproved"" there can be no
grounds in public policy for requiring that exceptional degree of certainty as
excludes all reasonable doubt that that fact does not exist. In their
Lordships' opinion the general rule applies in such a case and it is sufficient
if the court considers that upon the evidence before it it is more likely than
not that the fact does not exist. The test is the same as that applied in civil
proceedings: the balance of probabilities.

 

26.              I conclude that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act contains a reverse onus provision imposing a legal burden on an
accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he or she was not in
possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. It is therefore
necessary to determine whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act offends
the right to be ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"" as guaranteed
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(b)               The Presumption of Innocence and s. 11 (d)
of the Charter 

 

27.              Section 11 (d) of the Charter 
constitutionally entrenches the presumption of innocence as part of the supreme
law of Canada. For ease of reference, I set out this provision again:

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

28.              To interpret the meaning of s. 11 (d),
it is important to adopt a purposive approach. As this Court stated in R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344:

 

The meaning of a right or
freedom guaranteed by the Charter  was to be ascertained by an analysis
of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other
words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect.

 

                   In my
view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom
in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger
objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to articulate the
specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined,
and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights
and freedoms....

 

To identify the underlying purpose of the Charter  right in
question, therefore, it is important to begin by understanding the cardinal
values it embodies. 

 

29.              The presumption of innocence is a hallowed
principle lying at the very heart of criminal law. Although protected expressly
in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , the presumption of innocence is
referable and integral to the general protection of life, liberty and security
of the person contained in s. 7  of the Charter  (see Re B.C. Motor
Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, per Lamer J.) The presumption of
innocence protects the fundamental liberty and human dignity of any and every
person accused by the State of criminal conduct. An individual charged with a
criminal offence faces grave social and personal consequences, including
potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to social stigma and ostracism
from the community, as well as other social, psychological and economic harms.
In light of the gravity of these consequences, the presumption of innocence is
crucial. It ensures that until the State proves an accused's guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent. This is essential in a society
committed to fairness and social justice. The presumption of innocence confirms
our faith in humankind; it reflects our belief that individuals are decent and
law‑abiding members of the community until proven otherwise.

 

30.              The presumption of innocence has enjoyed
longstanding recognition at common law. In the leading case, Woolmington v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), Viscount Sankey
wrote at pp. 481‑82:

 

Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have
already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory
exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a
reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or
the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious
intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is
entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the
principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of
the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.

 

Subsequent Canadian cases have cited the Woolmington principle
with approval (see, for example, Manchuk v. The King, [1938] S.C.R. 341,
at p. 349; R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at p.
1316).

 

31.              Further evidence of the widespread
acceptance of the principle of the presumption of innocence is its inclusion in
the major international human rights documents. Article 11(I) of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted December 10, 1948 by the General
Assembly of the United Nations, provides:

 

                                                             Article 11 

 

I. Everyone charged with a
penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees
necessary for his defence.

 

In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
1966, art. 14(2) states: 

 

                                                             Article 14

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty according to law.

 

Canada acceded to this Covenant, and the Optional Protocol which sets
up machinery for implementing the Covenant, on May 19, 1976. Both came into
effect on August 19, 1976.

 

32.              In light of the above, the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty requires that s. 11 (d) have, at a
minimum, the following content. First, an individual must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, it is the State which must bear the burden
of proof. As Lamer J. stated in Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
350, at p. 357:

 

                   Section
11 (d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the
accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or calling other
evidence.

 

Third, criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with
lawful procedures and fairness. The latter part of s. 11 (d), which
requires the proof of guilt ""according to law in a fair and public hearing
by an independent and impartial tribunal"", underlines the importance of
this procedural requirement.

 

(c)               Authorities on Reverse Onus Provisions and
the Presumption of Innocence

 

33.              Having considered the general meaning of
the presumption of innocence, it is now, I think, desirable to review briefly
the authorities on reverse onus clauses in Canada and other jurisdictions.

 

(i)                The
Canadian Bill of Rights Jurisprudence

 

34.              Section 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, which safeguards the presumption of innocence, provides:

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal....

 

The wording of this section closely parallels that of s. 11 (d).
For this reason, one of the Crown's primary contentions is that the Canadian
Bill of Rights jurisprudence should be determinative of the outcome of the
present appeal.

 

35.              The leading case decided under s. 2(f)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights and relied on by the Crown, is R. v.
Appleby, supra. In that case, the accused had challenged s. 224A(1)(a)
(now s. 237(1)(a)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
which imposes a burden upon an accused to prove that he or she, though
occupying the driver's seat, did not enter the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion and did not, therefore, have care and control. This Court
rejected the arguments of the accused that s. 2(f) had been violated; it
relied on the Woolmington case which held that the presumption of
innocence was subject to ""statutory exceptions"". As Ritchie J. stated
in his judgment for the majority at pp. 315‑16:

 

It seems to me, therefore,
that if Woolmington's case is to be accepted, the words ""presumed
innocent until proved guilty according to law ..."" as they appear in
s. 2(f) of the Bill of Rights, must be taken to envisage a
law which recognizes the existence of statutory exceptions reversing the onus
of proof with respect to one or more ingredients of an offence in cases where
certain specific facts have been proved by the Crown in relation to such
ingredients.

 

36.              In a concurring opinion, Laskin J. (as he
then was) put forward an alternative test. He chose not to follow Ritchie J.'s
approach of reading a statutory exception limitation into the phrase
""according to law"" in s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, and said at p. 317:

 

                   I do
not construe s. 2(f) as self‑defeating because of the phrase
""according to law"" which appears therein. Hence, it would be
offensive to s. 2(f) for a federal criminal enactment to place upon the
accused the ultimate burden of establishing his innocence with respect to any
element of the offence charged. The ""right to be presumed innocent"",
of which s. 2(f) speaks, is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the
fact that the Crown has the ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is
any reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the case on any element of the
offence charged, an accused person must be acquitted. In a more refined sense,
the presumption of innocence gives an accused the initial benefit of a right of
silence and the ultimate benefit (after the Crown's evidence is in and as well
any evidence tendered on behalf of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin
v. U.S. (1895), 156 U.S. 432 at 452.

 

Nevertheless, Laskin J. went on to hold that the presumption of
innocence is not violated by ""any statutory or non‑statutory burden
upon an accused to adduce evidence to neutralize, or counter on a balance of
probabilities, the effect of evidence presented by the Crown"" (p. 318).
The test, according to Laskin J., is whether the legislative provision calls
for a finding of guilt even though there is a reasonable doubt as to the
culpability of the accused. This would seem to prohibit the imposition of any
legal burden on the accused; however, Laskin J. upheld a statutory provision
which would appear to have done precisely that.

 

37.              In a subsequent case, R. v. Shelley,
supra, involving a reverse onus provision regarding unlawful
importation, Laskin C.J. discussed further the views he had articulated in Appleby
at p. 200:

 

                   This
Court held in R. v. Appleby that a reverse onus provision, which goes no
farther than to require an accused to offer proof on a balance of
probabilities, does not necessarily violate the presumption of innocence under
s. 2(f). It would, of course, be clearly incompatible with s. 2(f)
for a statute to put upon an accused a reverse onus of proving a fact in issue
beyond a reasonable doubt. In so far as the onus goes no farther than to
require an accused to prove as essential fact upon a balance of probabilities,
the essential fact must be one which is rationally open to the accused to prove
or disprove, as the case may be. If it is one which an accused cannot
reasonably be expected to prove, being beyond his knowledge or beyond what he
may reasonably be expected to know, it amounts to a requirement that is
impossible to meet. 

 

In addition, Laskin C.J. sowed the seeds for the development of a
""rational connection test"" for determining the validity of a reverse
onus provision when he stated at p. 202:

 

                   It is
evident to me in this case that there is on the record no rational or necessary
connection between the fact proved, i.e. possession of goods of foreign
origin, and the conclusion of unlawful importation which the accused under s.
248(1) must, to avoid conviction, disprove.

 

38.              Although there are important lessons to be
learned from the Canadian Bill of Rights jurisprudence, it does not
constitute binding authority in relation to the constitutional interpretation
of the Charter . As this Court held in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
supra, the Charter , as a constitutional document, is fundamentally
different from the statutory Canadian Bill of Rights, which was
interpreted as simply recognizing and declaring existing rights. (See also Singh
v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177 per
Wilson J.; R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, per Le Dain J.) In
rejecting the Canadian Bill of Rights religion cases as determinative of
the meaning of freedom of religion under the Charter  in R. v. Big M
Drug Mart Ltd., the Court had occasion to say at pp. 343‑44:

 

I agree with the submission
of the respondent that the Charter  is intended to set a standard upon
which present as well as future legislation is to be tested. Therefore
the meaning of the concept of freedom of conscience and religion is not to be
determined solely by the degree to which that right was enjoyed by Canadians
prior to the proclamation of the Charter . For this reason, Robertson
and Rosetanni, supra, cannot be determinative of the meaning of
""freedom of conscience and religion"" under the Charter . We
must look, rather, to the distinctive principles of constitutional
interpretation appropriate to expounding the supreme law of Canada.

 

39.              With this in mind, one cannot but question
the appropriateness of reading into the phrase ""according to law"" in
s. 11 (d) of the Charter  the statutory exceptions acknowledged in Woolmington
and in Appleby. The Woolmington case was decided in the context
of a legal system with no constitutionally entrenched human rights document. In
Canada, we have tempered parliamentary supremacy by entrenching important
rights and freedoms in the Constitution. Viscount Sankey's statutory exception
proviso is clearly not applicable in this context and would subvert the very
purpose of the entrenchment of the presumption of innocence in the Charter .
I do not, therefore, feel constrained in this case by the interpretation of s.
2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights presented in the majority
judgment in Appleby. Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is not
rendered constitutionally valid simply by virtue of the fact that it is a
statutory provision.

 

(ii)               Canadian
Charter Jurisprudence

 

40.              In addition to the present case, there
have been a number of other provincial appellate level judgments addressing the
meaning of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d). This
jurisprudence provides a comprehensive and persuasive source of insight into
the questions raised in this appeal. In particular, six appellate level courts,
in addition to the Ontario Court of Appeal, have held that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act violates the Charter : R. v. Carroll, supra;
R. v. Cook, supra; R. v. O’Day, supra; R. v.
Stanger, supra; R. v. Landry, supra; R. v. Stock
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (B.C.C.A.) 

 

41.              Following the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in the present case, the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court (in
banco) rendered its decision in R. v. Carroll, supra.
Writing for the majority, MacDonald J. held at p. 105:

 

Unless a provision falls
within s. 1  of the Charter , there cannot be a requirement that an accused must
prove an essential positive element of the Crown's case other than by raising a
reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence cannot be said to exist if by
shifting the persuasive burden the court is required to convict even if a
reasonable doubt may be said to exist.

 

In a concurring judgment, Mitchell J. commented at pp. 107‑08:

 

                   Section
11 (d) gives an accused person the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty. It follows that if an accused is to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, he must not be convicted unless and until the Crown has proven
each and all of the elements necessary to constitute the crime.

 

Applying these legal conclusions to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
the Court held that s. 11 (d) had been violated. As Mitchell J. stated at
p. 108:

 

                   Under
s. 8 an accused is not presumed innocent until proven guilty. He is only
presumed innocent until found in possession. Once the Crown proves the accused had
possession of the narcotic, he is presumed to be guilty of an intention to
traffic until he proves otherwise.

 

42.              The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appellate
Division, also concluded that s. 8 is an unconstitutional violation of the s.
11 (d) presumption of innocence in its decision in R. v. Cook, supra.
After reviewing R. v. Oakes, supra, and R. v. Carroll, supra,
Hart J.A. concluded at pp. 435‑36:

 

                   Section
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is a piece of legislation that attempts to
relieve the Crown of its normal burden of proof by use of what is known as a
reverse onus. Different types of reverse onus have been known to the law and
proof of a case with the aid of a reverse onus can in my opinion, fall into the
wording of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  as being proof ""according
to law"".... I know of no justification, however, for holding that it would
be ""according to law"" to allow use of a reverse onus clause which
permitted the Crown the assistance of a provision which relieved it from
calling any probative evidence to establish one of the essential elements of an
offence.

 

Although concurring in result, Jones J.A. maintained that the
reasonableness test should be applied with respect to s. 1  and not with respect
to the words ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d).

 

The test of reasonableness
should be available in considering the secondary question under s. 1  of the
Charter . It is important that the burden of proof should be on the Crown to
show that a statute which violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. (p. 439)

 

43.              In R. v. O’Day, supra, the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal struck down s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
and registered its agreement with the three earlier provincial appellate level
courts. 

 

44.              The Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Stanger, supra, also found s. 8 unconstitutional; however, the court
was not unanimous in this conclusion. On the meaning of s. 11 (d),
Stevenson J.A., writing for the majority, paraphrased Martin J.A.'s comment in Oakes
and stated at p. 351 that the presumption of innocence meant ""first, that
an accused is innocent until proven guilty in accordance with established procedure,
and secondly, that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt"". Mr.
Justice Stevenson also cited MacDonald J.'s comment in Carroll that the
presumption of innocence is maintained ""as long as the prosecution has the
final burden of establishing guilt, on any element of the offence charged,
beyond a reasonable doubt"" (supra, p. 98).

 

45.              I should add that the majority, in Stanger,
correctly rejected the applicability of the Privy Council decision in Ong Ah
Chuan v. Public Prosecutor, [1981] A.C. 648. That case concerned
constitutional provisions of Singapore which are significantly different from
those of the Charter ; in particular, they do not contain an explicit
endorsement of the presumption of innocence. Moreover, the Privy Council did
not read this principle into the general due process protections of the
Constitution of Singapore.

 

46.              In R. v. Landry, supra, the
Quebec Court of Appeal invalidated s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act and
extended its conclusions to s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
As Malouf J.A. stated at p. 561:

 

                   Both
the Bill of Rights and the Charter  recognize the right of an accused to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. I cannot accept that
such a basic and fundamental principle can be set aside by such a reverse onus
provision.

 

47.              Finally, in a very brief judgment, R.
v. Stock, supra, the British Columbia Court of Appeal concurred with
the Court of Appeal decisions reviewed above, endorsing in particular the
Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Oakes. An earlier British Columbia
Court of Appeal opinion, Re Anson and The Queen (1983), 146 D.L.R. (3d)
661 (B.C.C.A.), had dismissed an appeal from a ruling which had upheld the
constitutionality of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act; however, the
basis for the denial of the appeal was procedural. The court did not assess the
constitutionality of s. 8 in relation to the presumption of innocence.

 

48.              There have also been a number of cases in
which the meaning of s. 11 (d) has been considered in relation to other
legislative provisions; see, for example, R. v. Holmes (1983), 41 O.R.
(2d) 250 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Whyte (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (B.C.C.A.),
leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted; R. v. Lee’s Poultry Ltd. (1985), 17
C.C.C. 539 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. T. (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 125 (N.S.C.A.); R.
v. Kowalczuk (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 25 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Schwartz
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Man. C.A.); Re Boyle and The Queen (1983), 41
O.R. (2d) 713 (Ont. C.A.) 

 

49.              To summarize, the Canadian Charter 
jurisprudence on the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) and reverse
onus provisions appears to have solidly accorded a high degree of protection to
the presumption of innocence. Any infringements of this right are permissible
only when, in the words of s. 1  of the Charter , they are reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

(iii)               United
States Jurisprudence

 

50.              In the United States, protection of the
presumption of innocence is not explicit. Rather, it has been read into the
""due process"" provisions of the American Bill of Rights
contained in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the
United States of America. An extensive review of the United States case law
is provided in Martin J.A.'s judgment for the Ontario Court of Appeal. I will,
therefore, merely highlight the major jurisprudential developments.

 

51.              In Tot v. United States, 319 U.S.
463 (1943), Roberts J. outlined the following test at pp. 467‑68:

 

... a statutory
presumption cannot be sustained if there be no rational connection between the
fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the inference of the one from
proof of the other is arbitrary because of lack of connnection between the two
in common experience.

 

The comparative convenience of producing evidence was also acknowledged
as a corollary test. The case involved a presumption to be drawn, from the
possession of firearms by a person convicted of a previous crime of violence,
that the firearms were illegally obtained through interstate or foreign
commerce. Of note was Roberts J.'s comment that even if a rational connection
had been proved, the statutory presumption could not be sustained because of
the prejudical reliance on a past conviction as part of the basic fact. The
accused would be discredited in the eyes of the jury even before he attempted
to disprove the presumed fact.

 

52.              In Leary v. United States, 395 U.S.
6 (1969), Harlan J. articulated a more stringent test for invalidity at p. 36:

 

... a criminal statutory
presumption must be regarded as ""irrational"" or
""arbitrary"", and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be
said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not
to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.

 

Harlan J. also noted that since the statutory presumption was invalid
under the above test, ""we need not reach the question whether a criminal
presumption which passes muster when so judged must also satisfy the criminal
`reasonable doubt' standard if proof of the crime charged or an essential
element thereof depends upon its use"" (footnote 64). 

 

53.              The United States Supreme Court did answer
this question in County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen, 442
U.S. 140 (1979). It held that where a mandatory criminal presumption was
imposed by statute, the State may not ""rest its case entirely on a
presumption unless the fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" (p. 167). A mere rational connection is
insufficient. This case illustrates the high degree of constitutional
protection accorded the principle that an accused must be found guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. The rationale for this is well stated by Brennan J. in
In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), at pp. 363‑64:

 

                   The
requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our
criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused during a criminal
prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the
possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the
certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a
society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not
condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about
his guilt.

 

(iv)              European
Convention on Human Rights Jurisprudence

 

54.              As mentioned above, international
developments in human rights law have afforded protection to the principle of
the presumption of innocence. The jurisprudence on The European Convention
on Human Rights includes a consideration of the legitimacy of reverse onus
provisions. Section 6(2) of The European Convention on Human Rights
reads:

 

                                                              Article 6

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law.

 

The meaning of s. 6(2) was clarified in the Pfunders Case (Austria
v. Italy) (1963), 6 Yearbook E.C.H.R. 740, at p. 782 and p. 784:

 

                   This
text, according to which everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be
presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, requires firstly that
court judges in fulfilling their duties should not start with the conviction or
assumption that the accused committed the act with which he is charged. In
other words, the onus to prove guilt falls upon the Prosecution, and any doubt
is to the benefit of the accused. Moreover, the judges must permit the latter
to produce evidence in rebuttal. In their judgment they can find him guilty
only on the basis of direct or indirect evidence sufficiently strong in the
eyes of the law to establish his guilt.

 

55.              Although the Commission has endorsed the
general importance of the requirement that the prosecution prove the accused's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it has acknowledged the permissibility of certain
exceptions to this principle. For example, the Commission upheld a statutory
reverse onus provision in which a man living with or habitually in the company
of a prostitute is presumed to be knowingly living on the earnings of
prostitution unless he proves otherwise (X against the United Kingdom,
Appl'n. No. 5124/71, Collection of Decisions, E.C.H.R., 135). The Commission
noted the importance of examining the substance and effect of a statutory
reverse onus. It concluded, however, at p. 135: 

 

The statutory presumption
in the present case is restrictively worded. ... The presumption is neither
irrebuttable nor unreasonable. To oblige the prosecution to obtain direct
evidence of ""living on immoral earnings"" would in most cases make its
task impossible.

 

(See discussion in Francis Jacobs, The European Convention on Human
Rights (Oxford: 1975), pp. 113‑14.)

 

(d)               Conclusion Regarding s. 11(d) of the Charter 
and s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act

 

56.              This review of the authorities lays the
groundwork for formulating some general conclusions regarding reverse onus
provisions and the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d). We can then
proceed to apply these principles to the particulars of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

 

57.              In general one must, I think, conclude
that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of
probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element
of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d).
If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. This would arise if the accused adduced
sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but
did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact
was untrue.

 

58.              The fact that the standard is only the
civil one does not render a reverse onus clause constitutional. As Sir Rupert
Cross commented in the Rede Lectures, ""The Golden Thread of the
English Criminal Law: The Burden of Proof"", delivered in 1976 at the
University of Toronto, at pp. 11‑13:

 

                   It is
sometimes said that exceptions to the Woolmington rule are acceptable because,
whenever the burden of proof on any issue in a criminal case is borne by the
accused, he only has to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities,
whereas on issues on which the Crown bears the burden of proof the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.... The fact that the standard is
lower when the accused bears the burden of proof than it is when the burden of
proof is borne by the prosecution is no answer to my objection to the existence
of exceptions to the Woolmington rule as it does not alter the fact that a jury
or bench of magistrates may have to convict the accused although they are far
from sure of his guilt.

 

59.              As we have seen, the potential for a
rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed fact to justify a
reverse onus provision has been elaborated in some of the cases discussed above
and is now known as the ""rational connection test"". In the context of
s. 11(d), however, the following question arises: if we apply the
rational connection test to the consideration of whether s. 11(d) has
been violated, are we adequately protecting the constitutional principle of the
presumption of innocence? As Professors MacKay and Cromwell point out in their
article ""Oakes: A Bold Initiative Impeded by Old Ghosts"" (1983), 32
C.R. (3d) 221, at p. 233: 

 

The rational connection
test approves a provision that forces the trier to infer a fact that may
be simply rationally connected to the proved fact. Why does it follow that such
a provision does not offend the constitutional right to be proved guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt?

 

A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not
prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. An accused person could thereby
be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt. This would violate the
presumption of innocence.

 

60.              I should add that this questioning of the
constitutionality of the ""rational connection test"" as a guide to
interpreting s. 11(d) does not minimize its importance. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test, however, is under s. 1  of the Charter .
This consideration did not arise under the Canadian Bill of Rights
because of the absence of an equivalent to s. 1 . At the Court of Appeal level
in the present case, Martin J.A. sought to combine the analysis of s. 11 (d)
and s. 1  to overcome the limitations of the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence. To my mind, it is highly desirable to keep s. 1  and s. 11 (d)
analytically distinct. Separating the analysis into two components is
consistent with the approach this Court has taken to the Charter  to date
(see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra; Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1
S.C.R. 357).

 

61.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, I am in no doubt whatsoever that it violates s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  by requiring the accused to prove on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. Mr. Oakes is compelled by s. 8  to prove he is not guilty of
the offence of trafficking. He is thus denied his right to be presumed innocent
and subjected to the potential penalty of life imprisonment unless he can rebut
the presumption. This is radically and fundamentally inconsistent with the
societal values of human dignity and liberty which we espouse, and is directly
contrary to the presumption of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d). Let us
turn now to s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                                                                    V

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act a Reasonable and
Demonstrably Justified Limit Pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

62.              The Crown submits that even if s. 8 of the
Narcotic Control Act violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it
can still be upheld as a reasonable limit under s. 1  which, as has been
mentioned, provides:

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. 

 

The question whether the limit is ""prescribed by law"" is not
contentious in the present case since s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is a duly enacted legislative provision. It is, however, necessary to determine
if the limit on Mr. Oakes' right, as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
is ""reasonable"" and ""demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society"" for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter , and
thereby saved from inconsistency with the Constitution.

 

63.              It is important to observe at the outset
that s. 1  has two functions: first, it constitutionally guarantees the rights
and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and, second, it states
explicitly the exclusive justificatory criteria (outside of s. 33  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 ) against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be
measured. Accordingly, any s. 1  inquiry must be premised on an understanding
that the impugned limit violates constitutional rights and freedoms‑‑rights
and freedoms which are part of the supreme law of Canada. As Wilson J. stated
in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, supra, at p.
218: ""... it is important to remember that the courts are conducting this
inquiry in light of a commitment to uphold the rights and freedoms set out in
the other sections of the Charter .""

 

64.              A second contextual element of
interpretation of s. 1  is provided by the words ""free and democratic
society"". Inclusion of these words as the final standard of justification
for limits on rights and freedoms refers the Court to the very purpose for
which the Charter  was originally entrenched in the Constitution:
Canadian society is to be free and democratic. The Court must be guided by the
values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I
believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the
human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a
wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in
social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals
and groups in society. The underlying values and principles of a free and
democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Charter  and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or
freedom must be shown, despite its effect, to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified.

 

65.              The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter 
are not, however, absolute. It may become necessary to limit rights and
freedoms in circumstances where their exercise would be inimical to the
realization of collective goals of fundamental importance. For this reason, s.
1  provides criteria of justification for limits on the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by the Charter . These criteria impose a stringent standard of
justification, especially when understood in terms of the two contextual
considerations discussed above, namely, the violation of a constitutionally
guaranteed right or freedom and the fundamental principles of a free and
democratic society. 

 

66.              The onus of proving that a limit on a
right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter  is reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society rests upon the party
seeking to uphold the limitation. It is clear from the text of s. 1  that limits
on the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Charter  are exceptions to
their general guarantee. The presumption is that the rights and freedoms are
guaranteed unless the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the
exceptional criteria which justify their being limited. This is further
substantiated by the use of the word ""demonstra­bly"" which clearly
indicates that the onus of justification is on the party seeking to limit: Hunter
v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

67.              The standard of proof under s. 1  is the
civil standard, namely, proof by a preponderance of probability. The
alternative criminal standard, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would, in my
view, be unduly onerous on the party seeking to limit. Concepts such as ""reasonableness"",
""justifiability"" and ""free and democratic society"" are
simply not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the preponderance of
probability test must be applied rigorously. Indeed, the phrase
""demonstrably justified"" in s. 1  of the Charter  supports this
conclusion. Within the broad category of the civil standard, there exist
different degrees of probability depending on the nature of the case: see
Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases (Toronto:
1974), at p. 385. As Lord Denning explained in Bater v. Bater, [1950] 2
All E.R. 458 (C.A.), at p. 459:

 

The case may be proved by
a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of probability within
that standard. The degree depends on the subject‑matter. A civil court, when
considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require a higher degree of
probability than that which it would require if considering whether negligence
were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even
when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require
a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.

 

This passage was cited with approval in Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual
Insurance Co., [1963] S.C.R. 154, at p. 161. A similar approach was put
forward by Cartwright J. in Smith v. Smith, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312, at pp.
331‑32:

 

I wish, however, to
emphasize that in every civil action before the tribunal can safely find the
affirmative of an issue of fact required to be proved it must be reasonably
satisfied, and that whether or not it will be so satisfied must depend on the
totality of the circumstances on which its judgment is formed including the
gravity of the consequences....

 

68.              Having regard to the fact that s. 1  is
being invoked for the purpose of justifying a violation of the constitutional
rights and freedoms the Charter  was designed to protect, a very high
degree of probability will be, in the words of Lord Denning, ""commensurate
with the occasion"". Where evidence is required in order to prove the
constituent elements of a s. 1  inquiry, and this will generally be the case, it
should be cogent and persuasive and make clear to the Court the consequences of
imposing or not imposing the limit. See: Law Society of Upper Canada v.
Skapinker, supra, at p. 384; Singh v. Minister of Employment and
Immigration, supra, at p. 217. A court will also need to know what
alternative measures for implementing the objective were available to the
legislators when they made their decisions. I should add, however, that there
may be cases where certain elements of the s. 1  analysis are obvious or self‑evident.


 

69.              To establish that a limit is reasonable
and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, two central
criteria must be satisfied. First, the objective, which the measures
responsible for a limit on a Charter  right or freedom are designed to
serve, must be ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutionally protected right or freedom"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart
Ltd., supra, at p. 352. The standard must be high in order to ensure
that objectives which are trivial or discordant with the principles integral to
a free and democratic society do not gain s. 1  protection. It is necessary, at
a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are pressing and
substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as
sufficiently important.

 

70.              Second, once a sufficiently significant
objective is recognized, then the party invoking s. 1  must show that the means
chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves ""a form of
proportionality test"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at
p. 352. Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on
the circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the
interests of society with those of individuals and groups. There are, in my
view, three important components of a proportionality test. First, the measures
adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They
must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short,
they must be rationally connected to the objective. Second, the means, even if
rationally connected to the objective in this first sense, should impair
""as little as possible"" the right or freedom in question: R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352. Third, there must be
a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are
responsible for limiting the Charter  right or freedom, and the objective
which has been identified as of ""sufficient importance"". 

 

71.              With respect to the third component, it is
clear that the general effect of any measure impugned under s. 1  will be the
infringement of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter ; this is
the reason why resort to s. 1  is necessary. The inquiry into effects must,
however, go further. A wide range of rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the Charter ,
and an almost infinite number of factual situations may arise in respect of
these. Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter  will
be more serious than others in terms of the nature of the right or freedom
violated, the extent of the violation, and the degree to which the measures
which impose the limit trench upon the integral principles of a free and
democratic society. Even if an objective is of sufficient importance, and the
first two elements of the proportionality test are satisfied, it is still
possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure
on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it
is intended to serve. The more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the
more important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

72.              Having outlined the general principles of
a s. 1  inquiry, we must apply them to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act.
Is the reverse onus provision in s. 8 a reasonable limit on the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society?

 

73.              The starting point for formulating a
response to this question is, as stated above, the nature of Parliament's
interest or objective which accounts for the passage of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act. According to the Crown, s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is aimed at curbing drug trafficking by facilitating the conviction of drug
traffickers. In my opinion, Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased can be characterized as substantial and pressing. The problem of drug
trafficking has been increasing since the 1950's at which time there was
already considerable concern. (See Report of the Special Committee on
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, Appendix to Debates of the Senate, Canada,
Session 1955, pp. 690‑700; see also Final Report of the Commission of
Inquiry into the Non‑Medical Use of Drugs (Ottawa, 1973).) Throughout
this period, numerous measures were adopted by free and democratic societies,
at both the international and national levels.

 

74.              At the international level, on June 23,
1953, the Protocol for Limiting and Regulating the Cultivation of the Poppy
Plant, the Production of, International and Wholesale Trade in, and Use of
Opium, to which Canada is a signatory, was adopted by the United Nations
Opium Conference held in New York. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
1961, was acceded to in New York on March 30, 1961. This treaty was signed
by Canada on March 30, 1961. It entered into force on December 13, 1964. As
stated in the Preamble, ""addiction to narcotic drugs constitutes a serious
evil for the individual and is fraught with social and economic danger to
mankind,..."" 

 

75.              At the national level, statutory
provisions have been enacted by numerous countries which, inter alia,
attempt to deter drug trafficking by imposing criminal sanctions (see, for
example, Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, 1975 (N.Z.), No. 116; Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971, 1971 (U.K.), c. 38).

 

76.              The objective of protecting our society
from the grave ills associated with drug trafficking, is, in my view, one of
sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right
or freedom in certain cases. Moreover, the degree of seriousness of drug
trafficking makes its acknowledgement as a sufficiently important objective for
the purposes of s. 1 , to a large extent, self‑evident. The first
criterion of a s. 1  inquiry, therefore, has been satisfied by the Crown.

 

77.              The next stage of inquiry is a
consideration of the means chosen by Parliament to achieve its objective. The
means must be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. As outlined above, this proportionality test should begin with a
consideration of the rationality of the provision: is the reverse onus clause
in s. 8 rationally related to the objective of curbing drug trafficking? At a
minimum, this requires that s. 8 be internally rational; there must be a
rational connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact
of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Otherwise, the reverse onus
clause could give rise to unjustified and erroneous convictions for drug
trafficking of persons guilty only of possession of narcotics.

 

78.              In my view, s. 8 does not survive this
rational connection test. As Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal
concluded, possession of a small or negligible quantity of narcotics does not
support the inference of trafficking. In other words, it would be irrational to
infer that a person had an intent to traffic on the basis of his or her
possession of a very small quantity of narcotics. The presumption required
under s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is overinclusive and could lead
to results in certain cases which would defy both rationality and fairness. In
light of the seriousness of the offence in question, which carries with it the
possibility of imprisonment for life, I am further convinced that the first
component of the proportionality test has not been satisfied by the Crown.

 

79.              Having concluded that s. 8 does not
satisfy this first component of proportionality, it is unnecessary to consider
the other two components. 

 

                                                                   VI

 

Conclusion

 

80.              The Ontario Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violates the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is therefore of no force or effect.
Section 8  imposes a limit on the right guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
which is not reasonable and is not demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 . Accordingly, the constitutional
question is answered as follows:

 

Question:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

81.              I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

 

                   The reasons of Estey and McIntyre JJ. were delivered
by

 

82.              Estey
J.‑‑I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the
conclusions of the Chief Justice with reference to the relationship between s.
11 (d) and s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
For the disposition of all other issues arising in this appeal, I would adopt
the reasons given by Martin J.A. in the court below.

      Offences and sentence 
       
       
      On 24 September 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to six counts of break enter and steal and one count of break enter with intent to steal in the Local Court at Newcastle. When he appeared before his Honour Judge Coolahan on 26 March 2004, the applicant adhered to those pleas. 
       
      
    4 As to the offences of break enter and steal, two were committed on 22 April 2003, a third was committed between 23 and 24 April 2003, the fourth was committed on 24 April 2003, the fifth on 13 May 2003 and the sixth on 20 May 2003. The break and enter with intent offence was committed on 23 April 2003. 
     
      
    5 In addition to those seven offences, his Honour was asked to take into account a further ten matters on a Form 1. Those comprised three counts of making a false statement to a pawnbroker committed on 22, 23 and 24 April 2003, four counts of break enter and steal committed on 21 April, 1 May, 12 May and 16 May 2003 and three counts of break and enter with intent to steal committed on 30 April, 7 May and 16 May 2003. 
     
      
    6 The maximum penalty for the offence of break enter and steal (s112(1) Crimes Act 1900) is 14 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence of break enter with intent to steal (s111(1) Crimes Act 1900) is 10 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for making a false statement to a pawnbroker is a fine of $5,500. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was arrested on 22 May 2003 and has remained in custody in relation to those matters since that date. On 31 March 2004 the applicant was sentenced by Coolahan DCJ as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Second break enter and steal committed on 22 April 2003, taking into account matters on the Form 1 – imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months. The non-parole period was to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2006. The parole period was to commence on 20 August 2006 and expire on 20 May 2008. 
       
       
      (ii) First break enter and steal committed on 22 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 November 2004. 
       
       
      (iii) Break enter and steal committed between 23-24 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 21 months to commence 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 February 2005. 
       
       
      (iv) Break enter and steal committed on 24 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 May 2005. 
       
       
      (v) Break enter and steal committed on 13 May 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2005. 
       
       
      (vi) Break enter and steal committed on 20 May 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months to commence on 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 November 2005. 
       
       
      (vii) Break and enter with intent to steal committed on 23 April 2003 – fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months to commence 21 May 2003 and expire on 20 August 2004. 
       
      
    8 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the above sentences. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    9 His Honour Coolahan DCJ in his remarks on sentence set out in full the statement of facts in relation to each offence prepared by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The applicant accepts the accuracy of that statement of facts. The statement is quite lengthy and for the purposes of this appeal, I set out only those facts relating to the two offences committed on 22 April 2003. These provide a sufficient indication of the nature of the other offences for which the applicant was sentenced and also cover the particular offences in relation to which submissions were made to the Court. 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the first offence committed on 22 April 2003, at about 8.30 am on that date, Terrence Crichton left his house at 96 Lake Road Wallsend to go to work. Mr Crichton returned home at about 2.30 pm that day and found that some time during the day, a window had been smashed and someone had gained entry to the house. He saw that a number of drawers in a dressing table and bedside tables had been pulled out, that wardrobe doors had been opened and drawers and a cupboard had been pulled out. As a result of the break in, a silver coloured Nikon camera with a zoom lens valued at $399 was stolen. The broken window cost $100 to have repaired.  
        
       
       
        
        On 24 April 2003, the offender attended Ready Cash Pawnbrokers at Charlestown and pawned the camera that had been stolen. (This latter transaction is one of the Form 1 matters). 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was arrested by police on 21 May 2003 and interviewed. In the course of the interview he told police that he remembered getting into the premises at this address by going through a window that he had smashed. He said that he could not remember what he stole from the premises, but did remember taking a camera. He did not specifically remember attending Ready Cash at Charlestown. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the second offence, on 22 April 2003 at about 7.45 am on that day, Mary Scott locked all the doors and windows of her house at 50 Lake Road Wallsend and left the premises. About 5.15 pm that afternoon she returned home and saw that the laundry window had been smashed, a wall unit had been moved and a quantity of DVD movies had been stolen. She also saw that a large quantity of jewellery, a Foxtel console, a DVD player, a watch and some travel bags had also been stolen. Mrs Scott told police that the value of the property stolen was in excess of $20,000. 
        
       
       
        
        On 22 April 2003, the offender attended Newcastle Pawnbrokers and pawned a number of DVD movies. On 23 April 2003 he attended Ready Cash Pawnbrokers at Charlestown and pawned a gold dress ring, a gold pendant and a gold necklace. On 26 April 2003, Mrs Scott received a telephone call from a lady who had found a jewellery box containing some jewellery and her fishing licence and Mrs Scott later retrieved the jewellery box and jewellery from an address in Hamilton and identified the items as belonging to her. They had been among the items stolen on 22 April 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        On 30 April 2003, Mrs Scott attended Ready Cash at Charlestown and identified the dress ring, the pendant and the necklace as items stolen from her on 22 April 2003. A large quantity of jewellery, the watch, the electrical equipment and the travel bags have not been recovered. Mrs Scott has informed police that the value of the property unrecovered is approximately $15,500. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was interviewed about this matter following his arrest. He told police that he had smashed the laundry window with a brick that he had found in the garden. He recalled taking the property referred to and pawning some of it as alleged.  
        
       
       
        
        When asked where the other stolen property was he replied “It’s been sold so it can’t be recovered.” He said that he did not sell the property to any particular person.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    10 The applicant was born on 23 November 1980 and was accordingly twenty-two at the time of the offences. He was unemployed. 
     
      
    11 Although the applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, the ERISPs in which he participated referred to a problem with illegal drugs and that the applicant had committed the offences in order to survive. 
     
      
    12 The applicant had a criminal record involving similar offences. In November 1999 he was convicted of five counts of break enter and steal and received a prison sentence. In May 2001 he was convicted of four counts of break enter and steal and was sentenced to a further period of imprisonment. On 20 March 2002 he was convicted of two counts of break enter and steal for which he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The applicant had been released from prison on 7 March 2003, approximately six weeks before the first of the present series of offences. He was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences.  
     
      
    13 His Honour accepted that the applicant’s plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and that there was a real utilitarian value in that plea. His Honour allowed a discount of twenty five percent in relation to that plea. His Honour also found that the applicant was genuine in his expression of remorse for the offences. His Honour noted, by way of finding special circumstances, that the applicant was serving his period of imprisonment in strict protection because it was believed by other prisoners that he was a police informant. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      Ground of appeal – The sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant’s sentence on the basis of the applicant’s assistance to the authorities in the admission of his guilt of the offences 
       
      
    14 The applicant submitted that he admitted to all of the offences in ERISPs conducted on 21 May and 18 June 2003. The longest sentence imposed was in relation to the second offence of 22 April 2003. This offence involved the largest sum of money and included the Form 1 matters. The evidence against the applicant in relation to that offence was that the applicant had on 22-23 April 2003 pawned a number of DVDs and some jewellery. The property pawned was only part of what was taken.  
     
      
    15 The submission was that the applicant’s admissions served to make out the case against him. The same argument was also put in relation to the first offence of 22 April 2003 and a further break enter and steal offence which took place on 13 May 2003 and which was included on the Form 1. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted that without this disclosure of guilt, it might have been very difficult for the Crown to establish its case against the applicant in relation to those offences. Despite the importance of that disclosure, and the assistance thereby provided to the Crown, the sentencing judge made no reference to it in his remarks on sentence and accordingly, fell into error. 
     
      
    17 Reliance was placed on the oft quoted passage in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given. 
        
       
       
        
        When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty, is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.” 
        
       
       
      
    18 The applicant submitted that the admissions of guilt in relation to those offences had a value beyond remorse. His Honour erred in failing to provide a substantial discount to reflect the utility of the applicant’s assistance and in doing so, his Honour failed to appropriately recognise the public benefit in encouraging offenders to admit guilt when it cannot otherwise be established. Such error being established, this Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    19 The start point in considering sentence is to identify the objective seriousness of the offences. This his Honour did at ROS 6-7 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts disclose serious offences. Break, enter and steal involving private households has virtually reached epidemic proportions. All too often people who have worked hard and saved to buy equipment such as that stolen here, all too often come home to find their premises have been broken into and the items which they have worked so hard to afford have been taken. Invariably, as seems to be the case here, at least so far as some of the items are concerned, these items are taken to a pawn shop which in my view are these days no more than licensed receivers of stolen goods, pawned for a fraction of their worth and never recovered. Very often the items are not covered by insurance, but even when they are, the reality is that the general community bears the price of these crimes through increased insurance premiums. It goes without saying that for offences such as this general deterrence must loom large in the sentencing consideration.” 
        
       
      
    20 It was then necessary for his Honour to balance the aggravating features of the offences against those in mitigation. The aggravating features of these offences far outweighed those in mitigation. 
     
      
    21 The aggravating features were: 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant had a record of previous convictions for similar offences since 1999 for which he had received sentences of imprisonment. He had only been released from prison some six weeks before the first of this series of offences. 
       
       
      (ii) Significant sums of money were involved and much of the property stolen was not recovered. 
       
       
      (iii) The offences were committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. 
       
       
      (v) The offences were seventeen in number and occurred over the space of three weeks. 
       
       
      (vi) There was some element of planning, albeit not sophisticated in the offences. 
       
      
    22 These were matters which have been regarded by this Court as having a cumulative effect in enhancing the seriousness of an offence. 
     
      
       
        
        “A court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s112(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is a cumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole. 
           
          (ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution. 
           
          (iii) The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. 
           
          (iv) The offence is committed at premises of the elderly the sick or the disabled. 
           
          (v) The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property. 
           
          (vi) The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s21 of the  
          Criminal Procedure Act) 
          . In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each:  
          Pearce v The Queen 
           (1998) 72 ALJR 1416. 
           
          (vii) The offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises. 
           
          (viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. 
           
          (ix) The offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender (a defined circumstance of aggravation –  
          Crimes Act 
           s105A(1)(f)), it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night. 
           
          (x) That actual trauma was suffered by the victim (other than the result of corporal violence, infliction of actual bodily harm or deprivation of liberty – defined circumstances of aggravation:  
          Crimes Act 
          , s105A(1)(c), (d) and (e)). 
           
          (xi) That force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon or instrument – a defined circumstance of aggravation:  
          Crimes Act 
           s105A(1)(a)).” ( 
          Re: Attorney General’s application [No 1] under s26 of Criminal Procedure Act, R v Ponfield 
           (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48] Grove J.) 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 By way of mitigation his Honour then had regard to the following matters: 
     
      
       
      (i) There was no wanton vandalism, no violence and the applicant took steps to ensure that the premises were not occupied. 
       
       
      (ii) Although some planning was involved, it was not particularly extensive. 
       
       
      (iii) The applicant’s pleas of guilty were entered at the first available opportunity. 
       
       
      (iv) The applicant had co-operated with the police and had been ready to assist them. 
       
       
      (v) The applicant had expressed genuine remorse. 
       
       
      (vi) There were special circumstances in that the applicant’s imprisonment would be served in strict protection. 
       
      
    24 His Honour allowed in the applicant’s favour a discount of twenty five percent for his early plea of guilty. His Honour arrived at the sentences after taking into account their objective seriousness and balancing the competing aggravating and mitigating factors. Subject to the particular matter raised in the appeal, no criticism could be made of his Honour’s subsequent exercise of discretion in awarding the sentences which he did. 
     
      
    25 What is said by the applicant is that it was not sufficient for his Honour to award a discount of twenty five percent for the applicant’s early plea of guilty. He should have awarded a further discount because the applicant’s admissions of guilt filled gaps in what would otherwise be a difficult Crown case. In that regard the admission of guilt should also be characterised as providing assistance to the Crown. 
     
      
    26 In order to deal with that submission it is necessary to set out how his Honour dealt with the early plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
        
        “Miss Anderson drew my attention to the fact that the offender’s pleas were entered at the first available opportunity, and I accept this to be the case. I also accept that whilst there may have been some degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences, they were unsophisticated in the sense that the offender did not wear gloves and left fingerprints behind virtually at all the crime scenes. Whilst this meant that the Crown cases against the offender were strong, had he chosen to go to trial, he may well have been entitled to separate trials which would have occupied a great deal of court time and I am, therefore, of the view that the discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas should be the maximum of twenty five percent. 
        
       
       
        
        Miss Anderson submitted that the offender was co-operative with police and ready to assist them. This seems to be the case when one looks at the transcript of his two records of interview. It does appear that whilst having a limited memory in relation to some of the offences, he was making an effort to clear the slate as it were. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst Miss Anderson submitted that I should accept that the offender was prepared to assist police, it does appear, as Mr Dalrymple submitted, that he was unwilling to name the person to whom he sold some of the goods stolen, describing him apparently only as an older wog who lived at Whitebridge.” (ROS 8-9) 
        
       
      
    27 There are two difficulties with the applicant’s submission. The first is its factual basis. It assumes that, absent the admission by the applicant, the Crown would have had a very difficult case. I do not agree. As his Honour pointed out, except in relation to the two offences on 22 April 2003 and the break enter and steal of 13 May 2003 the applicant was directly linked by fingerprints to another eleven offences. All of the offences occurred within a narrow geographical area, over a period of less than three weeks. In relation to the second offence of 22 April 2003 the applicant was directly linked to the disposal of stolen DVDs and jewellery at two separate pawnshops. The applicant’s admission of guilt in relation to that offence in particular (being the one for which he received the largest sentence) did not greatly assist the Crown and does not come within the sort of assistance contemplated by R v Ellis. 
     
      
    28 The second difficulty is a conceptual one. Even if the factual basis could be made out - that the Crown would have had considerable difficulty in proving this offence without the applicant’s admission, it seems clear that his Honour’s discount of twenty five percent for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty took into account matters such as this.  
     
      
    29 This is clear from R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the accused’s own disclosure or confession is the basis of the strong Crown case, this should be taken into account with respect to the utilitarian benefit. Indeed, such conduct should be regarded as the earliest possible timing for a plea.” (para 140, Spigelman CJ) 
        
       
      
    30 The Court clearly envisaged the very situation raised in this ground of appeal as included in the ten - twenty five percent discount on sentence to be awarded for the utilitarian value of an early plea of guilty. The sort of assistance which would entitle a further discount, such as was described in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 was the very kind of assistance which the applicant refused to provide ie, identify the receiver to whom the balance of the goods stolen from Mrs Scott had been delivered. It should also be noted that a similar argument to that raised in this appeal was considered by this Court in R v Halkias [2004] NSWCCA 429, [36]-[39] and was rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    31 His Honour did not err by including in his twenty five percent discount on sentence the applicant’s co-operation in pleading guilty to the three offences specified in the applicant’s submissions. That being the case, there is no basis for this Court to interfere with his Honour’s sentences. 
     
      
    32 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal dismissed.

Publications about the plaintiff


	
	The plaintiff has sworn a brief affidavit dated 1 March 2017 (Exhibit A), upon which he has not been cross-examined, about a series of publications about him, commencing with a television programme, A Current Affair, broadcast on 24 July 2015. In the course of argument, the parties referred to other publications about which the plaintiff had taken action. A chronology was not provided. Doing the best I can, these publications seem to be:
	



	
	The broadcast on A Current Affair on 24 July 2015, which was available for downloading thereafter. The plaintiff commenced proceedings in first the Supreme Court of Queensland on 27 July 2015 (which he discontinued in August 2015). As is set out in [13] of my judgment in Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 308, the plaintiff sent an email to Channel Nine on 18 August 2015 threatening further proceedings if the matter complained of was not taken down. He then brought proceedings in the District Court of Queensland, which are discussed in more detail below. On 22 July 2016, he commenced proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales in this court: Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd.
	
	
	An article in the Daily Mail dated 15 November 2015, which was available for downloading thereafter. The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation on 11 November 2015: Otto v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 32. The plaintiff does not provide any information in his affidavit as to his knowledge of this publication or the circumstances upon which he sought legal advice and commenced proceedings.
	
	
	A publication in the Gold Coast Bulletin dated 14 November 2015 “and continuing thereafter” (paragraph 4 of the statement of claim filed in these proceedings on 11 November 2016, the same date as the proceedings against the Daily Mail were commenced). This is the first of the publications the subject of this application.
	
	
	A publication in the Courier-Mail dated 13 November 2015 “and continuing thereafter” (paragraph 4 of the statement of claim filed in these proceedings on 11 November 2016).
	



	
	At the time the publications in paragraphs (c) and (d) above came to the plaintiff’s attention, he was already anxious to protect his reputation by commencing court proceedings. As is set out in Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd, shortly after filing an originating application in the Supreme Court of Queensland, the plaintiff sought legal advice from a solicitor and a barrister. Acting on that advice, he discontinued those proceedings in August 2015. He acknowledges, in his affidavit, being aware of the limitation period “in 2015” and the most likely reason for this is that he received legal advice to this effect in the course of or after the Supreme Court of Queensland proceedings.
	
	
	It was in these circumstances that, in early November 2015, he received a telephone call from a journalist employed by the Gold Coast Bulletin, who asked him questions about a Ms Shayla Chandler. The plaintiff then became aware of one of the publications the subject of this application, namely the Gold Coast Bulletin article of 14 November 2015, as Ms Chandler sent him a photocopy a few days after publication.
	
	
	The remaining publication in this application, namely the Courier-Mail, was published on 13 November 2015, but according to paragraph 12 of the plaintiff’s affidavit, he did not become aware of that publication until approximately 18 October 2016, following a Google search on or about the same date (whether that Google search was carried out by the plaintiff or some other person is unclear).
	
	
	On 2 December 2015 the plaintiff, still acting for himself, brought proceedings in the District Court of Queensland in relation to the A Current Affair broadcast for a second time. The court documents and judgment have not been provided to this court; all that I have been told is that the plaintiff was unsuccessful.
	
	
	The plaintiff states that, in the course of that application, a copy of the Gold Coast Bulletin was tendered by his opponents:
	


“7. On 2 December 2015, still acting for myself and without legal advice, I brought another claim, in the District Court of Queensland, against Patricia Higgins and Grant Williams, in regard to the Current Affair item (District Court Brisbane, case no. 4535 of 2015). On about 11 December 2015 I received from Macpherson Kelley, the solicitors for the respondents, Ms Higgins and Mr Williams, in that case, a copy of an affidavit dated 11 December 2015 made by Christian Dreyer, a solicitor of that firm (‘Dreyer affidavit’). Exhibit CHD-2 to that affidavit was a copy of the [Gold Coast Bulletin] article dated 14 November 2015. My claim for an injunction against Higgins and Williams came before Judge McGill in the District Court Brisbane on 11 December 2015. I appeared for myself. The judge refused to grant an injunction.”


	
	The plaintiff then decided to seek legal advice once again:
	


“8. In hindsight I realised that I should have taken legal advice before bringing the above claims in Queensland.

9. I became aware in 2015 that there is a one year limitation period for bringing claims for defamation. After December 2015 I still wished to bring a claim in regard to the Current Affair item and the [Gold Coast Bulletin] article, but I found it difficult to find lawyers who would act for me on a reduced fee or contingent basis, as I do not receive a regular income. In June 2016, I contacted Mr Clive Evatt, barrister in Sydney, who referred me to Carters Law Firm in Sydney. I retained Carters and they briefed Mr Clive Evatt of counsel in the matter.”


	
	The plaintiff gave what he calls “the Current Affair item” to his legal advisers in June 2016, but not the Gold Coast Bulletin article. No explanation is given for this, or for what advice he sought and received in relation to the Daily Mail article, although his legal representatives considered the proceedings in relation to the A Current Affair broadcast required them to act “urgently” because of the imminent expiry of the limitation date:
	


“10. On 22 July 2016, an action for defamation in this Court regarding the Current Affair item was filed on my behalf by Carters (No. 2016/221796, Otto v Nine Network Australia). This was done urgently as the one year defamation period was about to expire.”


	
	Even after those proceedings were commenced, the plaintiff took no further steps in relation to the Gold Coast Bulletin article until 2 September 2016:
	


“11. On 2 September 2016 I emailed to Mr Hansen of Carters the [Gold Coast Bulletin] article which I had copied off the internet. On about 17 October 2016 I was advised by Mr Hansen that I had a claim for damages in relation to this article, and the last date to file such a claim was 14 November 2016.”


	
	The day after the plaintiff received this advice from Mr Hansen (namely 18 October 2016) he “became aware from an internet ‘Google’ search of the Courier-Mail article dated 13 November 2015”. It is unclear from this statement what triggered this search, or by whom it was performed. Whatever the source, the plaintiff’s legal advisers were in no doubt about the defamatory nature of this publication and, I infer from the chronology of events, were able to advise him on the same day that he had what he calls “a further claim for damages based on the Courier-Mail article” (Exhibit A, paragraph 12).
	
	
	The plaintiff sets out that on or about 18 October 2016 he instructed his solicitor “to file such claim [sic] in relation to both articles”. This was in addition to the internet publication, which remained online at all relevant times.
	
	
	The reason why it took from 18 October 2016 until 11 November 2016 to prepare and file the statement of claim is unexplained. Nor is there any reference to when or in what circumstances the plaintiff became aware of the Daily Mail article.
	


The plaintiff sues the wrong defendants


	
	Regrettably, as both the plaintiff and his solicitor set out in their affidavits, the statement of claim in relation to these publications contained a catastrophic error. That error was to identify the first defendant as Nationwide News Pty Ltd and second defendant as News Corp Australia when in fact each of the publications the subject of these proceedings was published by another entity entirely; in the case of the first matter complained of by Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd (ACN 009 696 511) and in the case of the second matter complained of by Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd trading as News Queensland (ACN 009 061 778).
	
	
	The reasons for these errors are set out in the affidavit of David Hansen sworn on 20 April 2017 (Exhibit B). This affidavit states:
	


“2. On or about 18 October 2016 I received instructions to commence proceedings in relation to the articles which are the subject of these proceedings, namely a Gold Coast Bulletin article dated 14 November 2015 which appeared in print and on the internet and a Courier Mail article dated 13 November 2015 which appeared on the internet. Mr Clive Evatt of counsel was requested to draft the appropriate initiating documents.

3. On the afternoon of Friday 11 November 2016 Mr Evatt emailed to me a Statement of Claim naming Nationwide News Pty Ltd and News Corp Australia as Defendants. Mr Evatt also emailed me a Statement of Claim naming Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd as a Defendant. That Statement of Claim related to an article published on the Dailymail Australia website on 15 November 2015. On 11 November 2016 I caused the two Statements of Claim to be filed online with the District Court.

4. When I received the Statements of Claim from Mr Evatt, I assumed Mr Evatt was aware of the correct names of the publishers who published the articles and it did not occur to me to check the names provided by Mr Evatt. I was aware that Mr Evatt is an experienced barrister who practices primarily in the area of defamation law.

5. By letter dated 2 December 2016, I was informed by the solicitor for Nationwide News that with respect to the First Defendant, the wrong company had been sued. The solicitor also pointed out that the Second Defendant named was a business name. Upon receiving that letter, I forwarded a copy to Mr Evatt. I also spoke with Mr Evatt to enquire as to where he obtained the names of the Defendants. Mr Evatt said to me words to the effect, “I did a Google search”.”


	
	As a result of this error, the statement of claim filed on 11 November 2016, a matter of days before the expiry of the limitation period (and not served until 17 November 2016) was served on the wrong defendants.
	
	
	The solicitors for the plaintiff were notified of this on 2 December 2016 by the solicitors for Nationwide News Pty Ltd. The amended statement of claim was then filed on 9 December 2016 and served shortly thereafter.
	
	
	The period of delay is a relatively short one, namely 25 or 26 days respectively after the expiry of the one year after the print and first online publications and 28 days after the original statement of claim was filed.
	
	
	The period of delay does not mean the end of the plaintiff’s claim. Due to the manner in which the statutory regime for limitation periods for online publications has been interpreted by the courts to date, all that the plaintiff will lose is the chance to rely upon the print copies published on 13 and 14 November 2015 and that period of time for the online publications which falls outside the date on which this claim is filed (9 December 2016).
	
	
	As noted at the end of the judgment, findings of this kind effectively render the limitation period artificial, inconsistent and indeed futile, but the purpose of this judgment is to determine this application in accordance with existing authority, not to deplore the inadequacy of the uniform legislation’s inability to deal with limitation and other technology-related issues arising from online publication.
	


The legislation and relevant principles of law


	
	By way of clarification, the defendants say that the matters complained of were published on 14 November 2015 (not 13 November 2015 in relation to the Courier-Mail article), but nothing turns on this. The limitation period therefore expired on 14 November 2016 pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).
	
	
	Section 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) provides:
	


“56A Extension of limitation period by court

(1) A person claiming to have a cause of action for defamation may apply to the court for an order extending the limitation period for the cause of action.

(2) A court must, if satisfied that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within 1 year from the date of the publication, extend the limitation period mentioned in section 14B to a period of up to 3 years running from the date of the publication.

(3) A court may not order the extension of the limitation period for a cause of action for defamation other than in the circumstances specified in subsection (2).”


	
	The question is the meaning of the phrase “not reasonable in the circumstances”. This requires a consideration of the plaintiff’s conduct for the whole of the period prior to the expiry of the limitation period: Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd [2010] QCA 175. Applications of this nature generally turn on their facts.
	
	
	I propose to examine the following issues:
	



	
	When and how the plaintiff became aware of the one year limitation period;
	
	
	When and how the plaintiff became aware of each of the matters complained of;
	
	
	The degree to which the conduct of the plaintiff’s legal representatives, and their failure to act upon his instructions within the limitation period (in that they sued the wrong defendants), should be sheeted home to the plaintiff.
	


The plaintiff’s knowledge of the limitation period


	
	The plaintiff’s affidavit sets out that he commenced three proceedings for defamation against other publishers regarding other publications both before and during the limitation period in relation to the publications in these proceedings, namely:
	



	
	In relation to A Current Affair, in the Supreme Court of Queensland, on 27 July 2015 (paragraph 5). These claim, which was tendered in Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 308 (David Ashworth a.k.a. David Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (District Court proceedings 2016/221796)), sought “$3,018,960 “being total damages less punitive damages payable to the state [sic]”” (at [7]) and removal of material republished on other websites.
	
	
	In relation to A Current Affair, in the District Court in Queensland, on 2 December 2015 (paragraph 7).
	
	
	In relation to the A Current Affair programme, by filing a statement of claim in this court on 22 July 2016 (David Ashworth a.k.a. David Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (District Court proceedings 2016/221796)), which he acknowledges was “done urgently as the one year defamation period was about to expire” (paragraph 10).
	
	
	In addition, although not referred to by the plaintiff, he commenced proceedings in this court on 11 November 2016 in relation to the Daily Mail article (David Otto v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd (District Court proceedings 2016/00338264)).
	



	
	As noted above, the proceedings in (c) and (d) above were commenced a matter of a day or two before the expiry of the limitation period, which the plaintiff had been aware of since “2015” (paragraph 9).
	
	
	The defendants submit, and I accept, that whatever difficulties the plaintiff may have had in obtaining advice from solicitors prior to consulting his present solicitor in June 2016, he was aware, well prior to publication of the matters complained of, that there was a one-year limitation period. He had received advice from at least one solicitor and one barrister during this period of time as to how to commence proceedings.
	
	
	After the plaintiff consulted his current solicitors, they briefed Mr Evatt. It is not in dispute that in addition to the plaintiff being aware of the limitation period prior to his consultation of these practitioners, he would have been aware very early on about the one year limitation period in that they commenced proceedings on his behalf on 22 July 2016 in circumstances of some urgency by reason of the imminent expiry of the limitation period. In addition, as is set out in paragraph 11 of the plaintiff’s affidavit, he was advised by Mr Hansen on 17 October 2016 that the last date to commence these proceedings was 14 November 2016. How in these circumstances can it be said that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced proceedings prior to 14 November 2016?
	


The plaintiff’s knowledge of the additional matter complained of


	
	Although the plaintiff had been aware of both the A Current Affair publication and the Gold Coast Bulletin publication very shortly after these were published, the plaintiff says that he only became aware of the Courier-Mail article on “about 18 October 2016”. He was, however, advised that same day that he had a further claim for damages based on that article, and gave instructions to Mr Hansen to file a statement of claim in relation to both these articles, as well as the online publications.
	
	
	Ms Mullins submitted that it was hard to believe that experienced defamation lawyers, confronted by a client with at least two defamatory publications of some antiquity, would not have carried out a Google search in order to ascertain whether there were further publications where the limitation period was or could be close to expiry. Ms Mullins also submitted that it was unlikely that a person such as the plaintiff, who is sufficiently protective of his reputation to commence his own court proceedings twice, would not have made a similar search. While these matters do seem unlikely (particularly in light of the statement attributed to Mr Evatt that he carried out a Google search in relation to the names of the defendants), I must be cautious in drawing inferences of this sort from the affidavit material of the plaintiff.
	
	
	However, what cannot be in dispute is that the plaintiff had adequate knowledge of each of the matters complained of and of who published them. He had this information in sufficient time prior to the commencement of the limitation period. The main issue is the degree to which the plaintiff’s solicitor’s incompetence in suing the wrong defendant should be sheeted home to the plaintiff.
	


The conduct of the plaintiff’s legal representatives


	
	It is not uncommon, in personal injury proceedings, for limitation periods to expire due to errors or inaction by a solicitor who has sued the wrong defendant. For example, in McAuliffe v Bell [2005] NSWSC 214, where solicitors who were advised they had sued the wrong defendant failed to correct their mistake, leave was granted, on the basis that the plaintiff, a minor, had been wholly reliant upon his legal representatives. Similarly, in Mulpha Hotel Pty Ltd v Goff [2012] 1 Qd R 226, where the solicitors for the plaintiff sued the wrong defendant because they relied upon information given to them by the solicitors for the correct party, time was extended.
	
	
	Courts have been generous in this regard because ascertaining the true identity of a tortious wrongdoer in personal injury proceedings can sometimes be difficult (see, for example, Maamary v Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd & Ors [2001] NSWCA 375). That was not the case when the uniform legislation was enacted because, in the days before the Internet and social media began to dominate publishing, newspapers and broadcasters were obliged by law to disclose the corporations liable for publication, by a series of legislative provisions such as the Printing and Newspapers Act 1973 (NSW) and the Printing and Newspapers Act 1981 (Qld). The latter Act would apply to the print edition of the two Queensland newspaper articles and, as Ms Mullins pointed out, both newspapers correctly identified the publishers in the newspaper, in accordance with their legislative obligations.
	
	
	However, commencing proceedings against the wrong defendant is only the last of the mistakes made by the plaintiff’s legal representatives. Ms Mullins submits that the first was in not making a more general inquiry, in June 2016, as to other publications by a Google search. The plaintiff’s legal representatives must have seen the affidavit material for the failed December 2015 Supreme Court application for an injunction concerning A Current Affair, where the Gold Coast Bulletin article was relied on by the defendants, presumably as to the futility of granting an injunction where the allegations about the plaintiff had achieved wide currency.
	
	
	Whether or not the plaintiff’s legal advisers had seen the Gold Coast Bulletin prior to the plaintiff eventually sending it to them on 2 September 2016, they certainly took their time advising the plaintiff that he had a cause of action in relation to each of these publications, which they did not do until 18 October 2016 (paragraph 11).
	
	
	The next period of delay which is difficult to explain is the period between 18 October 2016 and 11 November 2016. What took the plaintiff’s solicitor so long to draft and file proceedings in a claim which was otherwise of a straightforward nature?
	
	
	Finally, the plaintiff’s solicitor became aware of the mistake as to the limitation period on 2 December 2016 but no statement of claim was filed until 9 December 2016, a week later. While a week may not seem long in limitation terms, it should be noted that commencing proceedings only a few days out of time was considered fatal in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd [2016] VCC 953.
	


The explanation for suing the wrong defendant


	
	In his affidavit, the plaintiff states at paragraph 14:
	


“14. I am informed by my lawyers that they relied on an internet ‘Google’ search of www.newscorpaustralia.com.au which indicated that one or both of the two companies named, both belonging to the News Limited group of media companies, was or were the publishers of the [Gold Coast Bulletin] and the Courier-Mail.”


	
	Ms Mullins submits that this is inconsistent to the reference to Mr Evatt doing “a Google search” (set out in Mr Hansen’s affidavit), and that this paragraph is “nonsensical”, because:
	



	
	It does not make any sense for the plaintiff’s legal representatives to search for a URL address that they already know.
	
	
	Further, it does not make any sense that they would search for that URL address when trying to identify the publisher of the Gold Coast Bulletin or the Courier-Mail. It indicates the plaintiff’s legal representatives were already aware of the URL address “www.newscorpaustralia.com.au” and believed that News Corp Australia may be the publisher.
	
	
	An internet Google search for the term “www.newscorpaustralia.com.au” does not provide any search results indicating that Nationwide News Pty Limited or News Corp Australia published the Gold Coast Bulletin or the Courier-Mail (Annexure A to the affidavit of Larina Mullins affirmed on 22 March 2017).
	
	
	If the plaintiff or his legal representatives had looked at editions of the Gold Coast Bulletin newspaper on the date of publication (on the page opposite the matter complained of) or on the date of filing the Statement of Claim, they would have seen the notice naming the publisher as Gold Coast Publications Pty Ltd (see Annexures B and C to Ms Mullins’ affidavit).
	
	
	If the plaintiff or his legal representatives had conducted a search for the owners of goldcoastbulletin.com.au and couriermail.com.au, they would have correctly identified the publishers (see Annexure D to Ms Mullins’ affidavit).
	
	
	If the plaintiff or his legal representatives had conducted a search for the business names “Gold Coast Bulletin” and “Courier-Mail”, they would have correctly identified the publishers (see Annexure E to Ms Mullins’ affidavit).
	
	
	If the plaintiff or his legal representatives had searched the Austlii website for previous defamation judgments involving the Gold Coast Bulletin and the Courier-Mail, they would have correctly identified the publishers (see Annexures F and G to Ms Mullins’ affidavit) as well as seen their own names as the persons acting for the plaintiff in some of those cases (e.g. Cross v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1340; Ghosh v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 151).
	
	
	Although not referred to by the parties, I consider that the plaintiff and his legal advisers would have been on notice of the Gold Coast Bulletin) from the moment they saw the Daily Mail because the Gold Coast Bulletin article is referred to repeatedly in it (see the Annexure to my judgment in Otto v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd).
	



	
	The defendant submits that the plaintiff cannot establish that it was not reasonable to commence proceedings prior to the expiry of the limitation period on the facts of this case because:
	



	
	The series of delays by the plaintiff as well as his legal advisers up to 11 November 2016, when the defective statement of claim was filed, are unexplained.
	
	
	The failure to make the most basic enquiries as to the identity of the defendants cannot be explained by the Google searches. This is not a case where there could ever have been any doubt about the identity of the defendants, both of whom were well-known to the plaintiff’s counsel and solicitors.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Mr Rollinson submitted that the plaintiff laboured under the disadvantage of representing himself for at least half of the limitation period, in that from November 2015 until June 2016, he was unable to find legal advisers who would act for him on the basis of a “no win, no fee” agreement. It is submitted that in those circumstances it was not reasonable for the plaintiff to have commenced proceedings for this period (to June, 2016) and, by implication, until he gave the matters complained of to his solicitors on 2 September and 18 October 2016 respectively. Thereafter, he was entitled to rely upon his solicitors to comply with his instructions to commence proceedings.
	
	
	A similar argument was raised before me in York v Morgan (2015) 20 DCLR (NSW) 341. In Mr York’s case, he lived in a remote part of New South Wales and had difficulty finding legal advisers at all, let alone any who were knowledgeable about the law of defamation; in the end, he commenced proceedings without assistance, but outside the limitation period.
	
	
	There is no such evidence in this case. To the contrary, the plaintiff had access to legal advice during 2015 in the form of a solicitor and barrister who were both very experienced with the law, he was able to commence legal proceedings in Queensland, and he was aware of the limitation period at all relevant times.
	
	
	Mr Rollinson submits that it was not reasonable to commence proceedings against the correct defendant where the plaintiff’s legal advisers were “misled by their internet searches” into thinking that these organisations were Nationwide News Pty Ltd or News Corp Australia, as named in the original statement of claim in that both these organisations are within the News Limited or “News Corp” media group. He draws to my attention that this group, by its in-house solicitors, had conducted the defence of the action by both the original and new defendants. The plaintiff’s sole problem is that in the original statement of claim he named the wrong publishing entities.
	
	
	Section 56A(2) Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) requires a consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the commencement of the action out of time, as Mr Rollinson noted in his written submissions at paragraph 10. He submits that the plaintiff’s situation, knowledge and state of mind shows the plaintiff conducted himself reasonably throughout, where a mistake was made by his legal advisers at a very late stage of the proceedings with the unfortunate effect of the limitation period expiring. That mistake is not the plaintiff’s and in those circumstances it should not mean, in the light of all the circumstances, that he should be penalised.
	


The relevant principles to apply


	
	The test posed by s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), rather than being wholly objective, invites inquiry into an applicant’s reasons for not commencing proceedings within the limitation period. The application of this test involves an evaluative process, the outcome of which depends upon the facts of a particular case: Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2012) 84 NSWLR 90 at [57], [61], [95] and [98].
	
	
	The principles of law are helpfully summarised by O’Neill DCJ in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd. His Honour observed at [64]-[65]:
	


“64 As has been said in many of the authorities, the task facing an applicant seeking an extension of time is a difficult one. The wording of s 23B of the Act makes it clear that it is not a question whether the steps taken by a plaintiff, whether in pursuit of non-litigious resolution of the issues, or in respect of his or her conduct generally, were reasonable, but rather that it was not reasonable to have issued the proceeding within the twelve month time period after publication.

65 In various legislation in this state, most notably the Civil Procedure Act 2010, there is a positive obligation on parties, their solicitors, and even insurers, to take steps to resolve or determine matters in dispute. Practitioners are encouraged, because of the vast cost of litigation and the limited judicial resources available, to make every effort to resolve a proceeding at a stage when they have available a sufficient understanding of the facts of the case to make an assessment of all of the litigious risks. Resolution of proceedings through mediation has become an essential element of the litigious process.”


	
	A litigant who postpones commencement of an action acts at his or her own peril, as later supervening unexpected events will not be sufficient where the time for commencing proceedings has expired: Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd at [52], cited in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd at [40].
	
	
	The plaintiff in the present case has none of the extenuating circumstances set out in Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd. Ms Mullins points out that there was no concerns notice or attempts to resolve this matter before proceedings commenced. Nor were there the kind of personal difficulties identified by O’Neill DCJ in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd (see [66] of his Honour’s judgment).
	
	
	The real difficulty is what to make of the error by the plaintiff’s legal advisers, which led to the proceedings being commenced against the wrong defendants. The approach taken in defamation proceedings concerning delay by a legal practitioner is very different to that taken in personal injury, as was noted in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd at [85] – [89]:
	


“[85] There is a further matter to be considered. That is, whether the sins of the solicitor (or counsel) ought to be visited upon the plaintiff. In applications for extension of time in respect of personal injury proceedings it is often said that if a plaintiff promptly consults a solicitor and does everything reasonable to provide instructions and prosecute a proceeding, otherwise leaving the conduct in the hands of his or her lawyers, the failure of those lawyers ought not lead to a refusal to extend time unless specific or general prejudice to the defendant can be shown. The availability of a cause of action against the solicitor is a relevant matter to take into consideration. I was not taken to, nor have been able to find authority on point in respect of an extension of time in defamation proceeding.

[86] Although the affidavit material does not critically examine the point, it would appear Dr van Garderen had done everything reasonable in the prosecution of the proceeding. She sought advice promptly and provided instructions from time to time as were needed. She gave instruction finally to issue. That aside, she left the conduct of the proceeding in the hands of her solicitor and counsel. There is nothing in the affidavit of Ms MacRae to suggest that there was any particular difficulty in obtaining instructions, although given the nature of the application, evidence to that effect would not be expected.

[87] In Pingel, Fraser JA said that the considerable delays on the part of the plaintiff’s solicitor and counsel “for present purposes” must be attributed to the respondent. In that case, the Court refused to extend the time in circumstances where the delay in bringing proceedings largely was attributed to the failures of the plaintiff’s solicitors and counsel.

[88] The Act provides a drastically short limitation period within which a defamation proceeding may be brought. The rationale for such a period is that the repair to reputation caused by a defamation should be acted upon promptly. Further, while the legislation provides, even encourages parties to undertake negotiations, nonetheless the test to obtain an extension of the limitation period is a harsh one and difficult for a litigant to overcome. All of those matters point to different policies underlying the limitation legislation as applied to defamation proceedings. In personal injuries litigation, it may be just and reasonable to grant an extension of time when a litigant has done no more than place him or herself in the hands of a solicitor who has neglectfully failed to issue within a limitation period. That concept does not exist in applications for extension in defamation proceedings.

[89] Absent any supporting authority, and given the authorities to which I have referred, the delays which may be directed to Ms MacRae and Mr Maher ought be attributed to Dr van Garderen.”


	
	However, in Van Garderen v Channel Seven Melbourne Pty Ltd, the statement of claim was not filed until after the limitation period expired. In the present case, the statement of claim was filed before the limitation period expired, but sued the wrong defendant. Is there a difference?
	
	
	In personal injury proceedings where a wrong party has been joined, decisions such as those referred to above make it clear that commencement of proceedings against the wrong defendant (unless there is a mistake as to the name of the kind protected under s 64 or s 65 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), which the parties agree is not the case here), meant that the limitation period had expired. This is the case even where proceedings have been legitimately commenced against another party within time: Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676. 
	
	
	The plaintiff was able to commence proceedings for defamation in relation to A Current Affair in July 2016. This was not an excuse for inaction in relation to these newspaper and online publications; to the contrary, it was a demonstration of the need for speed in commencing proceedings prior to the expiry of the limitation period about which the plaintiff had been aware from the first.
	
	
	While the period of time during which the plaintiff says he had knowledge of the Courier-Mail article was short (namely about the same time as that for the A Current Affair broadcast), he had plenty of time to commence proceedings (for an estimate of the kind of time this might take, see Barrett v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2016] NSWSC 1663 at [62]).
	
	
	As for the Gold Coast Bulletin, I am satisfied that not only did the plaintiff know about this publication in November 2015, but that his legal representatives must have seen it in June 2016 because of its role in the Queensland District Court injunction application and the repeated references to it in the Daily Mail article.
	
	
	In relation to both causes of action, I consider that the “sins of the solicitor” should be sheeted home to the plaintiff. He was no neophyte in terms of understanding in relation to court proceedings, he was aware of the limitation period’s imminent expiry and his own dilatoriness, particularly in relation to the Gold Coast Bulletin, was the principal reason for delay until right at the end of the limitation period.
	


Concluding remarks


	
	For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied, on the facts in this case, the plaintiff cannot establish that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for him to have commenced an action in relation to the matters complained of within one year of the date of publication.
	
	
	The next question is what orders should be made in relation to the claim in its current form.
	
	
	As other judges have noted in similar applications (Brooks v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 986), striking out the print publications does not end these proceedings, in that online version of the matters complained of are, by reason of the asserted absence of the “single publication rule”, still actionable for the 12-month period prior to the statement of claim. In that respect, this application has been, to a degree, somewhat artificial in nature. All the plaintiff needs to do to comply with my orders is to excise the publications which fall outside the limitation period, by filing an amended statement of claim, and I have framed my orders accordingly. That statement of claim must, however, contain full particulars of downloads during the relevant period, as claims for publication on the Internet are not complete unless those particulars are downloaded. Those particulars should include not only the date and place of the downloading but the names and addresses of the persons who downloaded the material, for reasons analogous to those explained in Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa (1985) 1 NSWLR 188 at 192, namely that there can be no cause of action unless the online publication was provided.
	
	
	The artificiality, in terms of result, of this application underlines an ongoing problem in defamation law in relation to electronic publications. The rationale for treating publication on the Internet (or, for that matter, emails) as being different from, for example, the lending library from which the Duke of Brunswick’s servant famously borrowed a book (Duke of Brunswick v Harmer (1849) 14 QB 185; [1849] Eng R 915; (1849) 117 ER 75) has not been the subject of judicial examination since the High Court’s obiter statement in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnik (2002) 210 CLR 575 that the multiple publication rule applies equally to online publications as well as to print. The full impact of the Internet was not foreseen even by the expert evidence provided to the Court in those proceedings; the Court (declining (at [30] – [31]) to consider Firth v State of New York (2002) 98 NY 2d 365; (2002) 775 NE 2d 463) concluded it was largely the same as television (at [39] in the joint judgment and at [125] per Kirby J) or newspaper publications (at [181] per Callinan J).
	
	
	The Australian interpretation of online publications as subject to the multiple publication rule produces results which appear to conflict with the strict test for extension of the limitation period for other defamatory publications to which the multiple publication rule applies as well as to other tort limitation reforms, the stated objects of the uniform legislation as well as damages principles (see D K Rolph, “A critique of the national uniform defamation laws” (2008) 16 TLJ 207 at 4, n.155 and 14), and possibly s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (Ghosh v Nine Digital Pty Ltd [2017] NSWCA 90).
	
	
	Whether the current interpretation of online publication is correct, whether (as has occurred in Google Inc v Trkulja [2016] VSCA 333) previous judgments have misunderstood the nature of the Internet and/or whether a single publication rule can be inferred from the limitation provisions in the current limitation legislation are questions which do not concern me in this application, although the ongoing failure of the uniform legislation to address electronic publication, despite Kirby J’s warning of this necessity in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnik, must be a matter of concern (Stephanie Rigg, “The Duke and his manservant in a world of online defamation” (2016) 21 MALR 424).
	
	
	Returning to the issues in this case, the only orders I propose to make are to dismiss the plaintiff’s notice of motion with costs, and to require the plaintiff to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim in 14 days, which must contain full particulars of downloading. The amended pleading is agreed by the parties to be the subject of an imputations argument on 8 June 2017.
	


Orders


	
	Plaintiff’s notice of motion dismissed; application for extension of time in relation to publications prior to 9 December 2016 refused.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendants’ costs of and incidental to the application, including (where applicable) the costs of the publications for which the extension of time has been refused.
	
	
	Plaintiff file a Further Amended Statement of Claim in 14 days.
	
	
	Matter stood over to Thursday 22 June 2017 for an imputations argument in the Defamation List.

Minguy v. The King, (1920) 61 S.C.R. 263

Date: 1920-12-17

Alexandre Minguy
Appellant;

and

His Majesty the King
Respondent.

1920: December 1; 1920: December 17.

Present:
Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Speedy trial—Election—Jury
trial—Requirement by the Attorney-General—Sections 446 (a), 690, 825, 826, 827,
828, 830, 833, 873, 1018, 1024 Cr. C.—(D.) 32-33 Vict, c. 29, s. 28—(D.) 8-9 Ed.
VII, c. 9, s. 2.

The appellant was accused of an offence,
punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding five years and for which he
had the right of election to be tried by a judge or a jury. He first elected to
be tried by a jury and, after the preliminary hearing, he was committed for
trial. Whilst still in custody of the sheriff, he wrote to the latter that he
was electing for a speedy trial and the sheriff notified the judge of the
sessions of this election. He was then brought before a district magistrate and
there elected for a speedy trial. Later on, the Attorney-General signed a
declaration that the indictment has been on his order ""brought before the
grand jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the appellant
tried before a jury and found guilty.

Held, Idington
J. dissenting, that the conviction of the appellant by a jury was legal.

Per Sir Louis
Davies C.J. and Duff J.—The requirement signed by the Attorney-General was in
compliance with section 825 Cr. C., as amended by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9. s.
2.—Idington J. contra and Anglin J. semble.

Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.—The election for a
speedy trial made by the appellant before a district magistrate was not valid,
as it should have been made before the residing judge of the sessions of the
Peace, according to section 827 Cr. C.

Per Idington
J. (dissenting).—The election by the appellant for a speedy trial, contained in
his letter to the sheriff, was valid, as being made in conformity with s.s. 2
of s. 828 Cr. C., and any subsequent irregularity could not affect the
appellant's rights.

Judgment of the Court of King's Bench
affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.

[Page 264]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the
trial judge, Desy J., with a jury and dismissing the motion made by the
appellant for a stated case.

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Fernand Choquette for the appellant.

Lucien Cannon K.C. for
the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—At the close of the argument on this appeal, I
was of the opinion that the only arguable point requiring consideration was to
the effect that the Attorney-General had not complied with the amendment to
section 825 of the Criminal Code, 8-9 Ed. VII., Ch. 9, which enacted that

where an offence charged is punishable with
imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, etc.

It was admitted that the offence charged in the
indictment came within this section.

After examining the indictment filed with the
record, it seems to me quite clear that there is nothing in this objection.

The indictment appears first to have been signed
by the crown prosecutors on behalf of the Attorney-General under section 873,
but in addition to this the Attorney-General personally signed a requirement on
the back of the indictment that ""it should be brought before the grand
jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the prisoner tried
before a jury and found guilty.

[Page 265]

It seems to me therefore that the amending
section of 825 has been fully complied with.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was brought before the magistrate of
the District of Quebec upon the accusation of an offence which entitled him to
a right of election to be tried by a judge or jury, and he elected the latter,
on the 28th April, 1920. Thereupon he was duly committed for trial accordingly.

On the 5th of May, following, whilst still in
custody of the sheriff, he availed himself of the privilege given by subsection
2 of section 828 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:—

2. Any prisoner who has elected to be tried
by a jury may, notwithstanding such election, at any time before such trial has
commenced, and whether an indictment has been preferred against him or not,
notify the sheriff that he desires to re-elect, and it shall thereupon be the duty
of the sheriff and judge or prosecuting officer to proceed as directed by
section eight hundred and twenty-six.

The sheriff duly notified the judge of the
sessions of this election.

Some question is now raised, for the first time,
as to whether the judge to whom the notice was delivered in fact was a judge of
the sessions.

That, to my mind, is quite immaterial. When once
the accused has duly made his election in the manner prescribed by the statute,
he has duly established his right to be tried by a judge, unless by virtue of
some other provision in the statutes that right has been overruled, or taken
away.

There is no pretence herein that any such
overruling of his election as was possible, under subsection 3 of the said
section, was seriously considered and

[Page 266]

determined against him. No such contention has
been set up. And if any mistake arose in the delivery of the sheriff's notice,
when properly addressed as the record before us shews or in the proceedings
thereon the prisoner must not suffer for that.

What is relied upon with more assurance is that
contained in the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1909, which, amongst other
changes, amended section 825 as it theretofore stood by adding subsection 5,
which reads as follows :—

5. Where an offence charged is punishable
with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, and may so require notwithstanding
that the person charged has consented to be tried by the judge under this part,
and thereupon the judge shall have no jurisdiction to try or sentence the
accused under this part.

Under this sub-section undoubtedly the
Attorney-General for the province can overrule the appellant's election.

The sole question with me herein is one of fact.
Did the Attorney-General deliberately decide, in light of the foregoing facts,
that the appellant should be deprived of his prima facie right of
election to trial by a judge instead of by a jury?

Curiously enough the opinion judgment of Mr.
Justice Martin seems expressly to admit that the indictment upon which the
appellant was convicted by the jury was

on the 9th of June * * * preferred against
the accused before the Grand Jury of the District then in session, upon the
order of the Attorney-General of the Province, under the provisions of Article
873 of the Criminal Code.

And Mr. Justice Pelletier in like manner attributes such action as the Attorney-General took
to have been done pursuant to same article 873 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 267]

That article reads as follows:—

873. The Attorney-General or any one by his
direction or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of
criminal jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of
indictment for any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such
consent.

2. Any person may prefer any bill of
indictment before any court of criminal jurisdiction by order of such court.

3. It shall not be necessary to state such
consent or order in the indictment and an objection to an indictment for want
of such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before
the accused person is given in charge.

4. Except as in this part previously
provided no bill of indictment shall be preferred in any province of Canada.

If what was done by the Attorney-General in way
of the preferment by the indictment in question is attributable to the
operation of said section, then, what was done by such preferment certainly
does not fall within the meaning of the amendment of section 825, by adding
subsection 5 above.

Up to the time of this express amendment the
Attorney-General could not, nor could any one on his behalf, take away the
right of election given the accused, though the learned judge or prosecuting
officer before him, had long had the power, under section 828, subsection 3, of
refusing to allow the exercise of the right of re-election in special cases
whenever they deemed it would not be in the interests of justice.

The occasion for this, by some mischance I am
unable to understand, possibly never arose. A possibly accidental absence of
the judge qualified to act is one surmise if, as suggested in argument, he who
did act was not, but then that could not deprive accused of the election he
made by his letter to the sheriff and forwarded by the sheriff's letter to the
right judge.

Be all that as it may, if the accused was not
brought up before the right judge, as the statute requires, that was the fault
of the prosecuting counsel,

[Page 268]

else we should not have the judicial assent
indorsed on the sheriff's letter, and that did not take away this right of the
accused, and due regard should have been had to the fact, on the motion to
quash the indictment. Any irregularity on the part of the local authorities in
the matter could not, as appears by Reg. v. Burke[1], affect the appellant's
rights.

With great respect, neither of these learned
judges in appeal seems to me accurately to have distinguished that which may
rest upon section 873 from that which must rest upon section 825, subsection 5,
added by the amendment of 1909. I agree with them that section 873 was all that
parties acting had in mind. The former is intended to govern the right to go
before a grand jury to prefer an indictment, which right at common law was
possessed by all the King's subjects but, by later legislation, was cut down to
what the Attorney-General might permit, or the learned judge presiding might,
on application to him; permit or order.

That modern way of restricting and regulating
proceedings before a grand jury was first introduced, so far as I can find,
into Canada by the Act respecting Criminal Procedure of 1869, 32-33 Vict., Ch. 29, sec. 28, confined to something like half a dozen offences.

Needless to trace how this at one time known as
relating to vexatious indictments was developed until the restriction became
complete and was subjected to the requirements of said section 873, just
quoted.

It is, however, imperatively necessary to bear
in mind herein the origin and purpose of that section and its requirements as
distinguishable from the origin and purpose of the later enactment of 1909,
upon which the decision of this appeal should turn.

[Page 269]

The mode in which the numerous attorneys general
of different provinces carried out the earlier enactment might vary in minor
details and, especially in the method of expression adopted for causing those
concerned to know and understand that required assent, no doubt differed.

That would, speaking generally, be a matter of
minor consequence.

It is a very different object that is to be
attained by the action of the Attorney-General upon the new section 825,
subsection 5, quoted above, which involves the taking away of a right of
election given to an accused person and implies the exercise of a kind of judicial
power or authority which the Attorney-General is, I submit, expected by the
amendment to specially direct his mind to in each case coming up for action.
The power is expressly one given to him alone and cannot be transferred to
another.

I am unable to see on this record any clear
exercise of any such power. What does appear therein seems to me more aptly
attributable to the provisions of section 873 as, by two of the learned judges
below, seems to have been inferred.

What possible reason could exist for the
exercise of such a power relative to what seems, at first blush, a very
ordinary sort of offence?

And again, if the Attorney General really
intended to take away the right from an accused of trial before a judge, I
should have expected I respectfully submit, to find it expressed by apt
language which would have left no room for argument, and that which we are
referred to does not express anything but what is consistent only with a
direction under section 873.

[Page 270]

Moreover how could there have been left in the
mind of any one concerned in the motion to quash the indictment, before accused
was forced to plead thereto, any doubt or difficulty, for if in fact the fiat
indorsed was in truth intended to mean what is contended for, surely in the
City of Quebec, above all places, that could easily have been set at rest by an
affidavit or otherwise.

Those accused of crimes may, in the majority of
cases, be at bottom in some minds entitled to very little consideration.

But we must guard their rights as sacredly as
possible, and remember that society is not well served by the conviction of any
man unless by due process of law strictly adhered to.

I think the appeal should be allowed, for the
reasons I have assigned, and that the right to have a case stated should have
been given him and, by reason not only of default thereof but under and by
virtue of the powers assigned in such event by sections 1018 and 1024,
respectively, to the Court of King's Bench and this Court, the conviction
should be quashed, or, if the majority of the court so conclude, referred back
to the learned trial judge to state such case as he should have stated.

See The King v. Hébert[2], and Reg. v. Hogarth[3],
as well as Reg. v. Burke[4],
already cited.

Duff J.—I concur with the Chief Justice.

Anglin J.—Only one of the objections to the validity of his conviction
taken on behalf of the defendant calls for consideration. It is that based on

[Page 271]

the alleged absence from the record of anything
which establishes the exercise by the Attorney-General of the power conferred
on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825 of the Criminal Code (8-9 Ed. VII, e. 9, s. 2) to
require that a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a
period exceeding five years shall be tried by a jury notwithstanding that he
has consented to speedy trial by a judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of
King's Bench in proceeding with the trial of this case is thus challenged. If
there was a valid election by the accused for a speedy trial, the jurisdiction
of that court was thereby superseded (ss. 825, 827 and 833, Cr. C.; Reg v.
Burke[5];
Rex v. Bissonnette[6],
per Lamothe C.J.) and could be re-established only by the Attorney-General
personally exercising the special power conferred on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825.
Being a condition of jurisdiction the fact that the authority had been
exercised should appear on the face of the proceedings. The ordinary
presumption in favour of the jurisdiction of a superior court scarcely covers
such a case.

The law does not prescribe any particular method
in which the Attorney-General is to act. Neither is notice to any person or
body required. Nor is it necessary that the Attorney-General should make his
requisition in open court. I am satisfied that the indorsement over his
signature on the indictment of his authorization for its presentment, provided
it is couched in terms which unmistakably imply action under s.s. 5 of s. 825,
will suffice.

But s. 873 Cr. C. likewise provides for the
preferring of indictments by or on behalf of the Attorney-General before a
grand jury. The power which that section confers, however, should not be
exercised where the

[Page 272]

accused has already elected for speedy trial,
and he may so elect after an indictment has been preferred under it. Giroux v.
the King[7].
This latter step was not taken in the present case, counsel for the prisoner
relying on what he assumed to have been a valid election for speedy trial
already made in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, and the case appears to
have proceeded in the Court of Appeal on the footing that such an election had
been duly made.

Counsel for the Attorney-General very frankly
stated, in answer to a direct question put by me, that if the indictment now
before us had been preferred under the authority of s. 873 it would have been
in its present form and might have carried precisely the indorsement found upon
it, namely:

Le présent acte d'accusation ""indictment'' est porté devant le grand jury par
ordre du soussigné procureur général de la Province de Québec.

9 juin 1920.

(Signé) L. A.
Taschereau,

Proc. Général de la
prov. de Quebec.

In other words, so far as the proceedings shew,
the action taken by the Attorney-General in regard to the presentation of this
indictment is referable quite as readily to s. 873 as to s.s. 5 of s. 825. It
is therefore impossible to say that it imports a requisition under the latter
provision. Under these circumstances, if there had been a valid election for
speedy trial, in my opinion it would be extremely doubtful, to say the least,
whether the conviction could stand and whether the motion to quash the
indictment made on behalf of the accused before plea should not have prevailed.

[Page 273]

But I find it unnecessary to determine this
question since, in addition to relying on the indorsement on the indictment as
sufficient evidence of the exercise of the power conferred by s.s. 5 of s. 825,
counsel representing the Attorney-General now insists, as it is quite within
his right to do (a respondent may support the judgment a quo on any
ground), that there was no valid election for a speedy trial because the
attempt of the accused to make such an election did not take place before the
judge of the Sessions of the Peace as contemplated by s. 827 Cr. C. Election
before the prosecuting officer (s.s. 2) is not suggested.

The District Magistrate, Corriveau, before whom
the record shews the accused was brought to make his election, was without
jurisdiction to receive it because there was at that time a Judge of the
Sessions of the Peace for the District of Quebec (s. 823 ii) as appears in the
record and is admitted by counsel for the appellant.

I cannot accede to the suggestion that the
notice to the sheriff, not required in this case (s. 826), but provided for in
other cases by ss. 825 (6), 828 (2), and 830 (2) itself constitutes an
election. Where it is made part of the procedure, that notice is a preliminary
step leading to the accused being given an opportunity to make his election by
being brought before the proper officer for that purpose. But the statute makes
it very clear that the election itself must take place before the judge or the
prosecuting officer ss. 825 (7), 826 and 827.

There was therefore no election by the accused
for a speedy trial sufficient to bring either ss. 3 and 4 of s. 827 or s. 833
into operation. It follows that, the

[Page 274]

jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench never
having been superseded, its re-establishment by action of the Attorney-General
under s. 825 (5) was not necessary. The indictment can be supported under s.
873.

I regard this rather as a case of first election
within s. 826 (7), than as a case of re-election within s. 828. Section 830 (2)
would be applicable, however, if the accused upon withdrawing his original
election for a summary trial had elected to be tried by a jury and the warrant
of committal for trial had so stated. That warrant is not in the record, and
the election which preceded it is stated in the proceedings to have been merely
to proceed by preliminary investigation in lieu of summary trial.

There was evidence on which a jury could find
the defendant guilty of the charge laid against him. Taken as a whole as it
must be, the charge is not open to the objections raised. The sentence imposed,
while apparently severe, was within the jurisdiction of the court. It is not
within our province to review its propriety.

The defendant may have a real grievance in that
he was not given the opportunity to which he was entitled of making an election
for a speedy trial before a competent judicial officer. But I know of no
redress for that grievance which it is open to us to accord him in this appeal.

Brodeur J.—Il s'agit d'un appel sous les dispositions
de l'article 1024 du code
criminel.

La question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si
la Cour du Banc du Roi avait juridiction pour juger l'appelant.

[Page 275]

Ce dernier allègue qu'ayant été accusé sous l'article 446a du code criminel, il a
opté pour un procès expéditif et que plus tard, malgré son option, il a été
amené par acte d'accusation devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, où il a été jugé et
condamné à quinze ans de pénitencier.

La Couronne pretend que l'appelant n'a jamais fait d'option valable et que, même s'il en a fait
une, le Procureur-Général avait le droit de le poursuivre par acte d'accusation
devant la Cour du Banc du Roi sous les dispositions de l'article 825, s. 5 du code criminel. A cela l'accusé répond que le Procureur-Général ne
paraît pas avoir régulièrement fait la demande dont parle l'article 825, s. 5.

Y a-t-il eu option d'un procès expéditif par l'accusé?
Les pièces que nous avons devant nous ne sont pas très claires sur ce point. Il
est bien évident cependant que l'accusé désirait avoir un procès expéditif sous
les dispositions de la partie 18ème du code criminel. En effet, après que le
magistrat de district qui avait fait l'enquête préliminaire, eut, le 5 mai 1920, jugé la preuve suffisante pour lui faire subir un procès (art. 690) et l'eût envoyé en prison pour y être
détenu en attendant son procès, les avocats de ce dernier ont notifié le
shérif, qui avait la garde de l'accusé, qu'il optait pour un procès expéditif
et qu'il fut amené devant

la Cour des Sessions dans le plus court délai
possible afin qu'il puisse faire sa déclaration à cet effet.

Le shérif, le 6 mai, informe par lettre le Juge des Sessions, suivant les dispositions
de l'article 826 du code criminel,
que Minguy déclare faire option pour ""un procès expéditif"". Cette
lettre du shérif est versée au dossier et nous y voyons sur le dos de la lettre
l'entrée suivante:

[Page 276]

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy. Option pour demander un
procès éxpéditif. Prod le 5 1920.

(Signé)                        T. & G.      G.P.

Le mois n'est pas mentionné, mais les parties
reconnaissent que c'est le mois de mai et que les initiales T. et G. sont
celles de Talbot et Gendron,
Greffiers de la Paix.

Nous voyons ensuite sur le dos de la même lettre
l'entrée suivante:

Québec, 7 mai 1920.

Présent: M. le Juge Corriveau, M.D.D.

Le prévenu étant présent, la décision sur son
option pour procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai 1920.

Gus. Chouinard,

D.G.P.

Les initiales M.D.D. signifient Magistrat de
district et celles D.G.P. signifient Député Greffier de la Paix.

Ces deux entrées que nous retrouvons sur la lettre
du shérif me paraissent peu explicites et correctes.

D'abord le 5 mai il n'a pas pu y avoir d'option pour procès expéditif, car à cette
date l'accusé n'avait pas encore été amené devant le Juge des Sessions. La
lettre du shérif adressée au Juge des Sessions n'a été envoyée que le 6 mai et ce n'est que le 7 que le prévenu comparaît devant un juge, qui
n'est pas, cependant, le Juge des Sessions mais un Magistrat de district,
celui-là même qui avait condamné l'accusé à subir son procès.

Il est admis par les deux parties qu'il y a un juge
des sessions à Québec.

En vertu du code criminel (Partie XVIII), les options pour procès expéditifs
doivent avoir lieu (art. 827) devant
le juge qui est défini par l'article 823 comme étant le Juge des Sessions. Le magistrat de district, suivant ce
dernier article, n'a juridiction que dans le cas où il n'y a pas de juge des
sessions.

[Page 277]

Le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, n'avait
donc pas juridiction dans le district de Québec où il y avait un juge des
sessions. Par conséquent, le prévenu n'a donc pu faire d'option valable pour un
procès expéditif.

D'ailleurs a-t-il fait une option qui enlevait à la
Cour du Banc du Roi toute juridiction?

L'entrée qui est sur la lettre du shérif, en date
du 7 mai, démontre qu'il n'y a pas
eu d'adjudication sur l'option du prévenu pour procès expéditif. L'entrée
n'exprime probablement pas correctement ce qui a eu lieu. A raison de ce qui
est survenu subséquemment, je serais porté à croire que ce jour-là, le 7 mai, la Couronne a fait une demande ou bien a
manifesté l'intention d'avoir un procès par jury, et que la question est restée
en suspens de savoir si l'accusé serait jugé à la Cour des Sessions ou à la
Cour Criminelle.

Avant l'amendement de 1909
(8 et 9 Ed. 7, ch. 9, s. 2), le privilège de
l'accusé de choisir un procès expéditif était absolu; et du moment que son
consentement pour un procès expéditif était inscrit au dossier, son procès
devait avoir lieu conformément aux dispositions de la partie XVIII du code criminel (art. 825, s.s. 2, 3 et 4 code criminel, S.R.C.
1906) c'est-à-dire devant le Juge
des Sessions de la Paix.

Les amendements de 1909 ont ajouté plusieurs autres sous-sections à l'article 825, et notamment une à l'effet que le
Procureur-Général peut faire une demande que le procès ait lieu devant un jury.

Il me semble que cette demande, si elle ne peut pas
être refusée, ainsi que le prétend l'intimé, doit être au moins consignée au
dossier de la cause afin d'évoquer la cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi ou
bien d'enlever au Juge des Sessions toute juridiction.

[Page 278]

Dans la cause actuelle, je suis d'opinion que
l'accusé a bien désiré opter pour un procès expéditif: mais son consentement
n'a pas été fait devant le juge compétent. Alors le Procureur-Général pouvait,
sous l'article 873 du code
criminel, porter un acte d'accusation devant le Grand Jury.

L'appelant se plaint aussi de l'illégalité des
instructions du juge au jury, mais il n'y a rien dans ces instructions qui
violent aucun principe de droit. Quant aux faits nouveaux qu'il prétend avoir
découvert depuis le procès et quant à la sévérité de la sentence, ce sont des
questions qui ne sauraient justifier notre intervention.

L'appel doit être renvoyé.

Mignault J.—Il y a deux questions à
examiner sur cet appel, car les autres griefs d'appel, dans mon opinion, sont
mal fondés; 1° L'appelant a-t-il
réellement opté pour un procès expéditif; 2° S'il y a eu telle option, l'acte d'accusation (indictment) sur lequel le procès a eu lieu
démontre-t-il que le procureur-général de la province de Québec exerçait le
pouvoir que lui confère le paragraphe 5 de l'article 825 du code
criminel, ou bien celui de l'article 873 du même code, qui permet au procureur-général ou à ses représentants de
soumettre un acte d'accusation au grand jury? Le pouvoir exercé sous l'article 825, al. 5, est d'une portée plus considérable que celui que confère l'article 873, car il rend sans effet l'option pour un
procès expéditif. Mais lorsque telle option n'a pas été valablement faite, il
va sans dire que l'acte d'accusation présenté par le procureur-général sous
l'opération de l'article 873, confère
pleine juridiction à la cour qui juge le procès. Du reste, dans l'espèce, le
magistrat

[Page 279]

de district avait fait l'enquête préliminaire et
avait déclaré qu'il y avait lieu de faire subir un procès au prévenu, de sorte que l'acte d'accusation aurait pu être soumis au grand jury sans l'ordre du
procureur-général.

Maintenant y a-t-il eu option du prévenu pour un
procès expéditif? Si j'arrive à la conclusion que la réponse doit être dans la
négative, je n'aurai pas besoin d'exprimer d'opinion sur la deuxième question.

Il est hors de doute que l'appelant désirait avoir
un procès expéditif, mais le désir ne suffit pas, il faut que l'option
elle-même soit faite devant une personne autorisée à la recevoir. A cet égard,
les parties admettent qu'il y a à Québec un juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'honorable M. Choquette. Il y a aussi un magistrat de district, M. Philéas
Corriveau.

Après son arrestation, l'appelant fut amené devant
le juge des Sessions de la Paix, où il fit option pour un procès sommaire. Il
lui fut cependant permis plus tard de
se désister de cette option, et de procéder par enquête préliminaire. Cette
enquête, si le magistrat trouvait matière à procès, pouvait, suivant son choix,
le conduire soit à un procès expéditif devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix,
soit à un procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi siégeant au criminel. Pour le
premier, le procès expéditif, il fallait une option du prévenu: pour le second,
le procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi, aucune option n'était requise.

Le 5 mai
1920, le magistrat de district
déclara, je l'ai dit, qu'il y avait matière à procès. Le même jour les
procureurs de l'appelant écrivirent au shérif de Québec le notifiant que leur
client désirait opter pour un procès expéditif et le prièrent, en conséquence,
d'amener l'accusé devant la cour des sessions dans le

[Page 280]

plus court délai possible afin qu'il pût faire sa déclaration à
cet effet. Sur réception de cette lettre, le shérif, le 6 mai, écrivit au juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'informant que l'accusé

déclare maintenant faire option pour un procès
expéditif.

D'après le code criminel, article 826, paragraphe 1er,

Tout shérif doit, dans les vingt-quatre heures
après qu'un prévenu ainsi que ci-haut est préventivement incarcéré en attendant
son procès, informer le juge par écrit que ce prévenu est ainsi incarcéré,
relatant son nom et la nature de l'accusation portée contre lui, sur quoi le
juge fait comparaître le prévenu devant lui sous le plus court délai possible.

Remarquons que par l'expression ""juge,""
la loi entend, dans le cas du district de Québec, le juge des sessions (art. 823 code crim.). Lorsque le prévenu est amené
devant le juge, celui-ci, après avoir pris communication des dépositions à la
suite desquelles le prévenu a été incarcéré:

(a) fait connaître au prisonnier de quelle
infraction il est accusé et lui en décrit la nature; et (b) lui explique qu'il
peut, à son choix, subir son procès immédiatement devant un juge sans
l'intervention d'un jury, ou rester en prison ou sous caution, selon que la
cour en décide, pour subir son procès de la manière ordinaire devant la cour
qui a juridiction criminelle. (Art. 827 code criminel.)

Si, lors, de cette comparution devant le juge, le
prévenu consent à subir son procès devant lui, sans l'intervention d'un jury,
le procès qu'on appelle expéditif se fait devant le juge.

D'après l'article 828, paragraphe 2,

tout prisonnier qui a opté pour le procès
devant un jury, peut nonobstant l'option ainsi faite, en tout temps avant le
commencement du procès, et soit qu'une accusation ait été ou non portée contre
lui, notifier, au shérif, qu'il désire revenir sur sa décision; sur quoi le
shérif et le juge ou le fonctionnaire poursuivant doivent suivre la procédure
prescrite par l'article huit cent vingt-six.

[Page 281]

Cette notification au shérif se fait dans le cas où
un prévenu, qui a opté pour le procès devant un jury, désire revenir sur sa
décision, et alors le shérif et le juge doivent suivre la procédure prescrite
par l'article 826 dont j'ai cité
le premier alinéa. Dans l'espèce, l'appelant n'avait pas opté en faveur d'un
procès devant un jury, mais avait choisi une enquête préliminaire, laquelle, je
l'ai dit, pouvait conduire soit au procès expéditif devant le juge des
sessions, soit au procès ordinaire devant un jury.

Le deuxième alinéa de l'article 828 suppose qu'il y a eu choix d'un procès
devant un jury, choix que le prévenu désire rétracter. Il y a une disposition
au même effet, et pour le même cas de rétractation d'option, aux alinéas 2 et 3 de l'article 830. Il y a
également une disposition semblable à l'article 825, paragraphe 6, pour les
accusés sous caution, mais il n'y est pas question de rétractation d'option,
mais du choix d'un procès expéditif.

Apparemment on a procédé ici comme si l'appelant
avait choisi un procès par jury et voulait revenir sur ce choix, car c'est dans
ce cas qu'on s'adresse au shérif lorsque le prévenu est incarcéré. Dans
l'espèce, le shérif a informé par écrit le juge des sessions que l'appelant
désirait maintenant fake option pour
un procès expéditif.

Sur réception de cette lettre, le juge des sessions
aurait dû faire comparaître le prévenu devant lui, et lui faire les
déclarations exigées par l'article 827, et c'était alors le moment de faire l'option d'un procès expéditif. Au
lieu de cela, le 7 mai, on a fait
comparaître l'appelant devant le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, et une
inscription au dos de la lettre du shérif—il semble au moins qu'on aurait dû faire une

[Page 282]

entrée au registre—indique que, le prévenu étant présent, la décision pour son option pour
procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai. En regard, on a écrit :

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy, option pour procès
expéditif. Prod. le 5, 1920,

avec les initiales des greffiers de la paix au bas.

Est-ce pour la raison que M. Fernand Choquette,
avocat de l'appelant, nous a indiquée, de sa parenté avec l'honorable M.
Choquette, juge des sessions, dont il est le fils, que M. Corriveau, le
magistrat de district, a siégé le 7 mai? Les dispositions du code de procédure civile qui auraient empêché
M. Fernand Choquette de comparaître devant son père en matière civile ne
s'appliquent évidemment pas à un procès devant une juridiction criminelle, et
alors que j'apprécie hautement le sentiment de délicatesse qu'invoque le savant
avocat de l'appelant, qui a très habilement plaidé cette cause, il est évident
qu'on devait ici suivre la procédure qu'indique le code criminel. Or
malheureusement c'est devant le juge des sessions que devait se faire l'option
d'un procès expéditif, en réponse aux déclarations que celui-ci devait faire au
prévenu au désir de l'article 827; et comme il s'agit d'une matière de juridiction de droit commun, et que
la procédure par voie de procès expéditif est de nature exceptionnelle, et
exige le consentement du prévenu devant le juge des sessions, je ne puis
arriver à la conclusion que la Cour du Banc du Roi, siégeant au criminel, qui
est la juridiction de droit commun, a été dessaisie de la cause par ce qui
s'est passé devant le magistrat de district.

Les honorables juges de la cour d'appel paraissent
avoir pris pour acquis qu'il y avait eu choix d'un procès expéditif. Le fait
qu'ils n'ont pas discuté

[Page 283]

la question dont je viens de parler me dispose à
croire qu'elle a pu n'avoir pas été soulevée devant eux. Mais évidemment cette
question est préjudicielle, car s'il n'y a pas eu choix régulier d'an procès
expéditif, il n'importe nullement que le procureur-général n'ait pas déclaré
expressément qu'il exigeait le procès devant un jury malgré l'option pour un
procès expéditif. Je n'ai donc pas à exprimer d'opinion sur la question que les
honorables juges de la cour d'appel ont longuement discutée.

Les autres moyens invoqués par l'appelant, je l'ai
dit, sont dans mon opinion mal fondés. L'appel doit donc être renvoyé.

OMAR KHAN AND OTHERS
 
 

 

 

10 JUNE 2013 
  

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE HILLIARD Q C.
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
1.	 

Each Defendant has pleaded guilty to an offence of engaging in conduct in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparation for committing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 5 of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Terrorism Act 2006.  Terrorism in this case means the use of action involving 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious violence against the person for the purpose of advancing a religious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or ideological cause.  Each of you planned an attack which was to take place 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 30th June 2012.  Your intended victims were those attending a rally of the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English Defence League in Dewsbury town centre.  Your motive was, to use 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  words,  “retaliation  for  your  blasphemy  of  ALLAH  and  HIS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Messenger  Muhammad.” 

   

 

The  means  you  chose  were  an  improvised 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explosive  device  containing  359  nails  and  93  ball  bearings;  2  sawn‐off
--------
shotguns and 9 rounds of  ammunition; 2 machetes, 2 swords and 6 knives. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Efforts had been made to sharpen some of these last items.  Your ages range 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between 22 and 28 years. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 
2.	 

 

 
3.	 

How was it that you became involved in a crime of this gravity?  At least part 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  answer  to  that  question  must  lie  in  the  tide  of  apparently  freely 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available extremist material in which  most of you had immersed yourselves. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  my  judgment,  this  aspect  of  the  case  has  a  continuing  significance. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It 
 

demonstrates,  in  the  words  of  the  prosecution,  a  close  and  committed 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in extreme Islamist ideology with an emphasis on jihad and violent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retribution.  The extent and degree of that commitment, as evidenced by the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts of this case, are such that in my judgment it will be a long time before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  truly  free  from  it,  assuming  that  that  is  your  desire.  I  am  satisfied 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  its  nature  that  it  extends  well  beyond  a  preoccupation  with  the  EDL, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although it was their profile which made them the object of your plans. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  material  concerned  was  discovered  in  the  course  of  a  thorough  and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

painstaking investigation by the police.  The following examples  are sufficient 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  present  purposes.  At  your  home,  Omar  Khan,  in  relation  to  digital 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material,  police  officers recovered 317 relevant  files  spread  across  an  MP3 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

player and a number of CDs.  15 contained extreme ideological material.  An 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

audio lecture was to the effect that whoever insults the Prophet Mohammed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be killed.

On  Jewel  Uddin’s  mobile  telephone  were  a  number  of  files  containing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ideological material, including one where the speaker said that it was right to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wage  war  against  the  unbeliever. 

   

 

 

 

 

The  kind  of  war  is  illustrated  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivational chants which were also recovered and which were interspersed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the sounds of gunfire. You collected some basic component parts of a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pipe  bomb,  having  seen  instructions  in  Inspire  magazine,  edition  1,  online, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but did not complete its manufacture. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

859  files  recovered  from  Mohammed  Hasseen’s  home  address  contained 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extreme ideological material including an invitation to young people to fight 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the West or join their brothers in the fronts of jihad ‐ Afghanistan, Iraq and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Somalia.  A digital copy of Inspire magazine  contained  the instructions I have 
 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  for  making  a  pipe  bomb.  Video  film  showed  a  bomb  factory, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons being fired, improvised explosive devices being prepared and a man 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently putting on a suicide vest. You say that you were holding some of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the devices which contained this material for other people. Your possession 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Inspire magazine is reflected in Count 2 which charges an offence contrary 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Section 58 (1) (b) of the Terrorism Act 2000 and to which you have pleaded 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilty. 
 

At  Mohammed  Saud’s  home  were  75  files  containing  extreme  ideological

in the background. You told the author of your pre‐sentence report that you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had viewed Inspire magazine online. 
 

 

 

 

 

Zohaib  Ahmed  was  in  possession  of  203  files  containing  extreme  material, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including lectures to the effect that non ‐ Muslims who refused to submit to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Islam should be killed, and guidelines for a would‐be terrorist as to how to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  and  prepare  an  attack.  A  video  file  showed  hooded  figures  placing  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roadside IED. 
 

 

In Anzal Hussain’s home was a pamphlet entitled “In defence of the Prophet”, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  title  as  was  chosen  for  the  document  in  which  the  Defendants 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to publicise the motivation behind events on the 30th  June.  A CD 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained chants and the sound of automatic gunfire. You had a fraction of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  material  some  others  had.  I  am  sure  nonetheless  that  you  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated by the same considerations as your co‐accused.  That is why you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  these  preparations  and  allied  yourself  with  others  who  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steeped in this material which extends, as I have said, far beyond a concern 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply with the EDL. 
 

 

 

 

Extreme material of this kind is not  difficult either to obtain or to share.  In 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  it  can  only  have  served  to  reinforce  the  defendants’  resolve  to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behave in the hideous way that was  planned.

The evidence reveals that preparatory steps were taken for at least 8 weeks. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  any  time,  any  one  of  you  could  have  thought  better  of  it,  but  it  is  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure of your commitment that none of you did so. Mohammed Saud says 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plans  were  only  revealed  to  him  on  3rd  June.  Even  so,  there  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ample opportunity to relent if he had wanted to. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On  3rd  May  2012,  Zohaib  Ahmed  viewed  the  website  of  a  company  which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stocked a brand of firework which was adapted to make the viable IED which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  taken  to  Dewsbury.  I  am  sure  that  this  was  an  incident  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparations  which  were  to  lead  to  Dewsbury  on  30th  June.  On  11th  June

In  a  notepad  at  his

Jewel Uddin had in his possession a document which gave advice on making 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent loan applications. 
 

 

 

On  1st  June  2012,  the  Renault  Laguna  which  was  used  to  transport  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons on 30th  June was purchased by a man calling himself Mohammed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Habibullah but giving Mohammed Hasseen’s telephone number.  The vehicle 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was then registered in a false name and insured on two occasions.  First, on 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9th  June 2012 for 24 hours. On 9th  June an EDL rally was held in Rochdale. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether any of you did in fact travel to Rochdale on that day is not known 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  am  sure  that  the  group  did  at  least  contemplate  going  there  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconnaissance  purposes.  The  vehicle  was  also  insured  on  29th  June  for  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short period.  Mohammed Hasseen accepts that he  paid for the insurance on 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each occasion using Mohammed Saud’s details .  The certificate for 9th  June 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  found  at  Jewel  Uddin’s  home  address.  For  the  second  period  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  ,  the  contact  e‐mail  address  provided  was  the  same  one  as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Hasseen had used in applying for a loan on the 29th  May.  On 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29th  June, one numeral in the registration number was inputted incorrectly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the result that the Renault Laguna was not in fact insured. As sometimes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens, such a small mistake was to lead to the defendants’ detection. The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other vehicle involved on 30th  June, a Rover 25, was purchased on 29th  June 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Mohammed  Hasseen.  Omar  Khan  and  Jewel  Uddin  were  seen  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle minutes after  its purchase .

On  the  12th  June,  Jewel  Uddin  and  Mohammed  Hasseen  had  travelled  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dewsbury.  The visit was  for the purpose of reconnaissance in advance of the 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30th June EDL rally. 
 

 

 

 

The computer found at Zohaib Ahmed’s address  conducted internet searches 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the EDL, Rochdale and Dewsbury on 11th  June.  YouTube videos showing 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the EDL Rochdale demonstration on 9th June were viewed on 11th June on the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  computer.  On  the  11th  June  Mohammed  Hasseen  also  viewed  web 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages relating to the EDL. The computer found at Mohammed Saud’s home 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been used on 30th June in searches for the EDL, Dewsbury Town Hall and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for success in battle and jihad . The evidence demonstrates that the 5 who 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to Dewsbury  were all at the address at the time.

knives  which  were  recovered  in  due  course  from  the  boot  of  the  Renault

On 30th June, the 5 Defendants who travelled from Birmingham to Dewsbury 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discarded their mobile telephones to avoid their movements being tracked . 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Renault Laguna and the Rover 25 travelled in convoy to Dewsbury.  They 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were seen in the town centre at 4:16 pm. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  due  course  when  the  Renault  was  examined,  there  was  a  CD  in  the  CD 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

player entitled “The dust will never settle.” Jewel Uddin’s fingerprints were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  it.  It  included  a  lecture  exhorting  murderous  retribution  against  those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived to have insulted the Prophet Mohammed. Other CDs in the vehicle 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained equally extreme material. 
 

 

 

 

At 4:25 pm. on 30th June, the Rover was seen at the railway station car park. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was the assembly point for the demonstration as advertised by the EDL 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on their website.  In fact, it had ended earlier than anticipated and the crowd 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had dispersed by about 2:30 pm.  Providentially, the Defendants had arrived 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too late to put their plan into effect. There is, however, no reason to suppose 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a further attempt would not have been made at some time in the future 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had the defendants not been apprehended.  I regard it as inconceivable that 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your resolve would have evaporated. 
 

 

 

 

 

After visits to a mosque and a fish and chip shop, the two vehicles returned 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

towards Birmingham.  Shortly after 6 pm., the Renault was stopped by police. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The occupants were Omar Khan and Jewel Uddin.  The vehicle was showing

as uninsured on the police national computer.  At first, Khan gave his name as 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed  Habibullah,  the  name  which  had  been  used  to  purchase  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle.  Later he did give his true name but the police decided to impound 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vehicle.  Khan and Uddin bought train tickets to Birmingham.  Khan  was 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen to have large bundles of cash.  The Rover arrived back in Birmingham 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later the same evening.

The impounded Renault was searched the next day.  In the boot was found 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the weaponry I have already described.  In addition, there were 10 copies of 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the document entitled “Operation: In defence of the Prophet Muhammad.” 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zohaib Ahmed wrote this document. It was printed at Mohammed Hasseen’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address.  One  paragraph  was  addressed  to  the,  and  I  quote,  “EDL  (English

Had you managed to put your plan into effect, I am sure that  that is how you 
  

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all viewed it at the time and how you would have sought to publicise it. The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extravagant  language  reflects  your  misguided  views.  When  you  were 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested in early July 2012, each of you made no comment when interviewed. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsequently, in defence statements submitted in February 2013, you were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  claim  that  what  you  did  amounted  to  lawful  preparation  for  action  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  self‐defence  or  defence  of  others  and  Not  Guilty  pleas  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered on 22nd  February 2013.  More recently, you have accepted by your 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleas  of  Guilty  that  that  cannot  be  the  case.  Those  pleas  of  Guilty  were 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered on the 30th April 2013. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

The principal and only viable IED consisted of a cardboard firework tube with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cone. 
 
   

It  contained  the  explosive  content  of  at  least  2  fireworks  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significantly, 359 nails and 93 ball bearings.  An expert concluded that if the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fuse  had  been  lit,  and  the  device  had  exploded,  hot  shrapnel  would  have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been projected at high velocity.  The expert could only think of one reason for 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the addition of the nails and ball bearings, namely to increase the likelihood 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of serious injury being caused.  No other has been suggested. Whatever the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for abandoning the preparations for a pipe bomb, its substitute was a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horrible weapon.  There was no question, the expert concluded, but that if 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the device had been ignited an explosion would have occurred.  The effective 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range was anticipated to be in the  order of perhaps a few tens of metres, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe less.  If initiated in a crowded, confined space, serious, possibly fatal,

injuries  were  to  be  expected.  I  accept  the  impossibility  of  predicting  its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise  point  of  explosion  with  accuracy  but  that  only  underlines  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indiscriminate nature of such a device. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

In the boot were also the component parts of a pipe bomb  along the lines of

Uddin who began to construct such an item in this case.  Zohaib Ahmed had 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also been in possession of a digital copy of Inspire 1 in July 2011. This had

information likely to have been useful to a person preparing or committing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an act of terrorism. On 22nd  June 2012, he had been released on bail by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrates court when his case was sent to the Crown Court . 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inspire  1  contains  a  shocking  mixture  of  extreme  ideological  material  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  instruction,  including  how  to  make  an  explosive  device. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It 
 

emphasises  the  importance  of  including  shrapnel  and  says  that  the  device 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be placed in a crowded area. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although in less than perfect condition, both shotguns were in working order 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ammunition  was  suitable  for  use  in  them.  One  of  the  shotguns 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required lubrication to function when it was examined 7 months or so later. I

is presently assessed as posing a high level of risk to the general public. As it

as this, reports  provide a Judge with direct access to what a Defendant is 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying about their attitude to what they have done. And it is right to record

remorse for it – that is very  important. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There were indications of a failure by some of you, even at the stage when 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reports  were  prepared,  to  acknowledge  the  full  extent  of  what  you

basis of plea that your intention was to engage in a violent confrontation with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those attending the EDL rally and to use the weapons and the IED to cause 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious injuries, and  that you anticipated that some victims may have died. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That must follow from the nature of the dreadful collection of material with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  were  armed.  Each  of  you  accepted  in  your  defence  statements

aspect of this case.  That simply cannot be a feature of life in a society where 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the overwhelming majority choose to live in peace and harmony with their 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fellow men and women, whether they share the same religious beliefs or not. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have seen, read and heard material about the EDL and about what you and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others felt about them and their activities. As a matter of generality, unlawful 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence of any kind , and foul  and inflammatory insults of a racial nature or 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed  towards  a  particular  religious  group  deserve  at  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least 
  

unequivocal condemnation, whoever or  whatever the source.  I acknowledge 
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  unrest  and  enormous  distress  such  behaviour  gives  rise  to.  But  as  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response,  more unlawful violence is not on the list of options. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Had the prosecution advanced their case upon the basis that your intention 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to kill and if you fell to be sentenced on that basis, then in my judgment 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a life sentence would have come to the fore. Even now, I have given anxious 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration as to whether it is the right course to take. In the event, by a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow margin, I can deal with you in another way. But the fact that you all 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipated that fatalities could result makes this a very serious case and is a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant matter when assessing the danger that each of you poses in the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future.

In the case of each of you, I take account of your age. You are all young men. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is an age span of 6 years but I cannot discern any difference in maturity 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between you. Khan and Uddin have no previous convictions at all . Hasseen, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Saud  and Hussein have nothing recorded against them  that would prevent 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me giving them the same credit.  I do so.  Although you, Zohaib Ahmed, now 
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  convictions  in  September  2012  for  possessing  material  likely  to be  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  to someone  preparing or  committing  acts of  terrorism,  on  the  facts  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case I do not regard that as a basis for making a distinction between you 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and your co‐accused.  Certain it is that in the course of  preparations for this 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended attack, others had had access to material of  the same  kind. It is, 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however,  plainly an aggravating feature in your case that you were on bail 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you committed this offence.  I regard it as another indication of your 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment  and  determination.  Unlike  the  others,  some  of  the  time  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have spent in custody awaiting sentence will not count towards it because 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  been  serving  a  sentence  for  the  earlier  offences.  I  accept  Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Munyard’s submission that aside from that, the sentence in your case should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be longer than in the case of any co‐accused by virtue of the convictions 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone. 
 

As to your respective involvement, save in the case of Mohammed Hasseen, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  defendant  has  sought  to  make  any  distinction.  I  have  considered  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  for  myself.  As  a  matter  of  commonsense,  not  everyone  can  be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  every  act  of  preparation.  Each  of  you  was  involved  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 15 -
--------
preparations  to  a  significant  degree.  In  your  pre‐sentence  reports,  each  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  described  your  role  and  said  that  the  idea  and  enthusiasm  for  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence  was  equally  shared.  Although  you,  Mohammed  Hasseen  ,  did  not 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel on the mission to Dewsbury, your fingerprints are quite literally all over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant items. In your case, I have read a letter from your wife who is the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother of your 3 young children. You attended a wedding on 30 June. But I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

am  sure that it also suited your purposes to stay behind so as to be  certain 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that one member of this group would not be captured at the scene and so 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in due course  you could assist any other or others who escaped. Given 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  interest in  matters of  an  extreme  kind and  the  overall  extent  of your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement, no other conclusion is possible. I reach it  without regard to the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contents of your pre‐sentence report. Nonetheless, I accept the submission 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Mr Friedman QC that some distinction is appropriate. The prosecution do 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not dissent from that. Your hand would not have been on any of the weapons 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time when they were intended  to be used. Aside from that, after very 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careful  consideration  of  everything  that  I  have  read  and  heard,  I  assess 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Saud and Anzal Hussain as having been to a degree less involved 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the preparations than the others who went to Dewsbury. I shall make an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowance for that. 
 

 

 

 

 
40.	 

I  take  account  of  all  the  points  that  have  been  helpfully  and  persuasively 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made 
   

in  mitigation. 
   

 

In  particular,  I  bear  in  mind  of  course  that  by  good 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fortune alone this attack did not in fact take place. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 16 -

41.	 

 

I  have  read  carefully  a  file  of  documents  which  speak  about  each  of  you. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They include a letter from Mr Khan’s father, a letter from Mr Uddin’s brother, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the letter from Mr Hasseen’s wife,  evidence of kindnesses done by Mr Saud, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of difficulties Mr Ahmed has which served to isolate him to some extent , and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the help Mr Hussain gave his mother in difficult circumstances.  I have read 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  psychological  report  for  Mr  Khan.  Although  he  has  moderate  learning 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulties, I have to record that he was able to take part in constructing a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viable IED.  You all have family members who will suffer continuing  distress 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  what  you  have  brought  upon  yourselves  .  Others  would  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered  if  you  had  succeeded in your  plans.  As to the  potential  for  better 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influences to bear upon you,  the fact is that you chose to ignore them and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were able to keep hidden  from them what you were planning. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42.	  My attention has been drawn to a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and to sentences passed in other cases at first instance.  In Martin [1999] 1 Cr 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

App  R  (S)  497,  the  Court  of  Appeal  reiterated  the  significance  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between cases where an explosive device was intended to cause 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury to the person rather than damage to property. The Court said that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bracket for offences which involved causing or planning  terrorist explosions 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wider in each direction  than 20 – 35 years. In Barot [2007] EWCA Crim 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1119 and Jalil [2008] EWCA Crim 2910, the Court of Appeal referred to the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that terrorist offences have become graver in recent times. Of course, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 17 -
--------
aside  from  the  IED,  any  group  which  possessed  only  the  remainder  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons  in  this  case  with  criminal  intent  would  commit  a  very  serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence. In the final analysis, the sentences I pass must be determined by the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular facts of this case. Inevitably, they must include an element which is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to deter others from behaving in the same way. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am sure that what motivated each of you to commit this offence must have 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run very deep indeed.  It would have to have done so before anyone could 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even contemplate committing it, leave alone engage in the preparations you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  and  then  actually  set  off  to  carry  it  out.  In  my  judgment,  it  would  be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unrealistic to suppose that detection and prosecution by themselves would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sufficient  to  bring  about  a  lasting  change  of  heart.  The  obvious  risk  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those things was not sufficient to deter you as you prepared for your attack. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  take  account  of  what  is  said  in  the  reports  about  your  intentions  for  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future but it seems to me that that will be much harder to achieve than to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, even taking account in each case of your age and of change which can 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take place with the passage of time. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
43.	 

 

44.	  My  attention  has  been  drawn  very  properly  to  the  extent  of  the  stringent 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notification requirements and licence conditions to which you will be subject 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on release from custody. I have considered them very carefully. However, in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  judgment  the  combination  of  those  requirements  and  a  substantial 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinate sentence is not sufficient to provide the necessary protection of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 18 -
--------
the public which I must do my best to achieve in addition to punishing you for 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this offence.  I am sure that the extra burdens provided for by Parliament in 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  extended  sentence  of  imprisonment  are  required  in  the  case  of  each 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendant,  looked  at  individually.  This  is  so  as  to  provide  the  degree  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  which  the  law‐abiding  community  looks  to  the  courts  for  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face of criminality of this gravity, motivated by ideology,  in this day and age. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each  of  you  has  been  convicted  for  the  purposes  of  section  226A  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Criminal Justice Act 2003 of a specified offence and I consider  for the reasons 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  have  given  that  there  is  a  significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  harm  occasioned  by  the  commission  by  each  of  you  of  further 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specified offences. 
 

 

 

 
45.	 

Accordingly, there will be a custodial term and a further period for which you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be subject to a licence.  The appropriate custodial term is the one that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be imposed apart from Section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  extension  period  will  be  for  a  period  of  such  length  as  I  consider 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary for the purpose of protecting members of the public from serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm  occasioned  by  the  commission  by  each  of  you  of  further  specified 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offences.  In fixing the custodial term, I give you credit in accordance with the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline for reduction in sentence for a guilty plea.  Although the pleas of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty were entered on re‐arraignment and after a trial date had been set, it is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to acknowledge that you have avoided the need for a trial of at least 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some weeks, and I assess the credit in all the circumstances at one‐quarter.  I 
    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 19 -
--------
do not regard the issues and practicalities in this case as ever having been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  that  you  can  sensibly  be  said  to  have  indicated  an  intention  or  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willingness  to  plead  guilty  at  the  first  reasonable  opportunity.  Even  an

admission to  participation in the underlying preparations was some months 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in coming. 
 

 

Of the sentence I pass on Count 1, you will serve two‐thirds of the custodial 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element before your case will be referred to the Parole Board for them to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider release . Whenever you are released, you will be subject to a licence 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the expiry of the extension period I impose. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

On  Count  2,  the  sentence  upon  Mohammed  Hasseen  is  one  of  2  years’ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment to run concurrently with the sentence upon Count 1.  This case 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrates graphically  the potential consequences of possessing material 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this kind, and I have to look at the offence in its context. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  respect  of  Count  1,  I  assess  the  figure  before  credit  for  plea  as  being  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custodial  term of 26 years’ imprisonment for Omar Khan, Jewel Uddin and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zohaib  Ahmed, and of 25 years for Mohammed  Hasseen , Mohammed  Saud

Omar  Khan,  Jewel  Uddin  and  Zohaib  Ahmed  is an  extended sentence  of 
 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment of 24 and a half  years , of which the custodial part will be for

Mohammed Hasseen, Mohammed  Saud and Anzal  Hussain,  the sentence is

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The appellant, who is unrepresented before this Court, was convicted after trial by jury of an offence that on or about 22 March 2005 he attempted to possess goods that had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act being narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin of not less than the trafficable quantity for that drug. The trial was conducted before Judge Ainslie-Wallace (the Judge) and the appellant was represented by counsel. As a consequence of his conviction the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four years. The appellant is eligible for release to parole on 21 March 2009. 
     
      
    3 The form of Notice of Appeal completed by the appellant indicates that he is appealing against both his conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal filed and the written submissions he has placed before the Court refer mainly to his conviction. In effect the appellant contends that the conviction was unreasonable in light of a number of matters that he has raised as grounds of appeal. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The police warrant for interception of telecommunications the Crown used against me which was an intercepted public telephone call has nothing to do with me, it has to do with another Nigerian male who lives in the vicinity of the public telephone area. 
         
         
        2. My name is never mentioned in the conversation and the police did not use visual surveillance evidence or direct voice identification evidence that would connect me to the call. 
         
         
        3. I was not in possession of drug or any documentation relating to the relevant post box and EMS postal tracking results or mobile phone registration. 
         
         
        4. The search of my house residence did not locate any paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking or supply and there is no evidence that I have the capacity to distribute drugs. 
        
       
      
    4 There is one further ground that presumably relates to his sentence being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        5. I had no criminal record or previous conviction and was relatively youthful (20 years old) at the time. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The Crown case was that on 28 January 2005 Australian Federal Police lawfully intercepted telephone calls made from a public telephone at Wolli Creek in Sydney. The target of the warrant permitting the interception of the calls was a Nigerian man but not the appellant. The calls were made in a language spoken in Nigeria. The caller, who identified himself as Obasanjo, spoke with a person overseas, identified as Acho, who told him that the place they were using was India and not Brazil and that he would ""feed"" Obasanjo. Obasanjo gave him an e-mail address so that he could send him the ""number"" and they both could ""monitor its movement on the machine"". The e mail address was “obj25@yahoo.com” 
     
      
    6 In another call on that day Obasanjo gave the other speaker, identified as Fedamatic, a telephone number. That service was registered in the name of James Morrisey of 15 John Street, Ashfield. Subsequent inquiries found that no person by that name lived at that address 
     
      
    7 The Tempe Newsagency was run by Mr and Mrs Colman. As part of the business they operated a number of private mailboxes that were located outside the newsagency on the street. Mail was delivered to the newsagency and received by the Colmans who placed it into the appropriate mailbox. If a package was too large to fit into a mailbox, it was held behind the counter and a notification put into the mailbox. 
     
      
    8 On 14 February 2005 Mrs Colman had a conversation with a person who indicated that he wished to renew Box 13. Mrs Colman received money from him and renewed the rental. The transaction was captured on a security camera that recorded visual images but not sound. 
     
      
    9 One 22nd March 2005 a parcel was delivered to the newsagency addressed to Joe Michael 13/727 Princes Highway. The parcel had been sent by Express Mail Service (“EMS”) from India. Australia Post operated a website where items sent by EMS could be tracked by reference to an ""item number"". Mrs Colman took delivery of the parcel and put it beneath the counter. She later contacted the Australian Federal Police. 
     
      
    10 Shortly thereafter the appellant, who Mrs Colman said was the same man who had renewed post box number 13 in February, came into the newsagency and said, ""Box 13"". Mrs Colman replied, ""The police have been in and picked up this parcel"". The appellant responded, ”Oh” and Mrs Colman repeated, ""The police have the parcel"". The appellant then said, ""Oh, okay, okay, yeah"" and then left the shop quickly. This transaction was also captured on the security camera. It was open to the jury to conclude that the actions of the appellant captured on the video at the time of this conversation, were suspicious. 
     
      
    11 There was no dispute at the trial that the appellant had attended the newsagency on 22nd March and asked for Box 13. It was also conceded that it was the appellant who was recorded on the videotape of the security camera for that day. It was disputed that the appellant had been the person who had renewed the rental of the box. 
     
      
    12 After the appellant left the newsagency, Mrs Colman again rang the Federal police. At about 9 a.m. Federal Agents attended the newsagency and collected the parcel. It was taken to police headquarters where it was opened and two plastic bags were found inside a book. They contained just over 197 grams of powder. The powder was later found to contain pure heroin weighing 108 grams. 
     
      
    13 Federal police then returned to the area near the newsagency and commenced surveillance. About 1.25 p.m. the appellant was stopped and spoken to. He said that he lived at unit 2/24 Clarence St, Rockdale. He was asked to show the contents of his pockets and removed two mobile phones - one a Sagem and the other a Sony Ericsson. He was asked why he had two mobile phones and the appellant shrugged his shoulders. He was allowed to walk away but was followed by police. He was seen to enter a store where he made a number of telephone calls. A short time later he was arrested. 
     
      
    14 On 20 April 2005 police showed Mrs Colman a photo board containing twelve photographs of dark-skinned males including one of the appellant. Mrs Colman marked a photograph that was not the appellant indicating that this might have been the person who came to pick up the parcel. She also told police, ""They all look the same"". 
     
      
    15 The two mobile phones taken from the appellant were later examined. Data obtained from the SIM card found inside the Sagem phone included the SMS text ""this is my emil ad. obj25 yahoo.com”. This was the e mail address given by Obasanjo in the telephone conversation intercepted by Federal police from the public telephone at Wolli Creek. 
     
      
    16 The Sagem mobile phone was registered to “James Tan” of 5 John Street, Ashfield. The Sony Ericsson was registered to “Rick Martin” of 15 John Street, Ashfield. Neither person was known at those addresses. 
     
      
    17 The appellant declined to participate in an interview with police following his arrest and did not give evidence before the jury. Therefore there was no explanation by the appellant for his actions in going to the newsagency shortly after the parcel had been delivered and inquiring about Box 13. 
     
      
    18 In summing up the judge told the jury that the ""real dispute in this matter ………is that the accused attempted to take possession of the heroin"". In order to prove that matter the Crown relied upon a circumstantial case and the Judge gave the jury the usual direction that, before they could convict the accused, they must be satisfied that there was no other reasonable explanation open on the facts other than that the appellant knew that the parcel contained drugs when he attempted to obtain possession of it. 
     
      
    19 In that regard the judge said this in the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The evidence on which the Crown relies to prove the accused's knowledge is: the contents of the telephone call of 28 January from the phone box in Wolli Creek to a person who is referred to as Acho and later to a person referred to as Fedamatic, I will come back later and discuss these with you. The Crown relies on the e-mail address found on the Sagem phone whichj was taken from the accused when he was arrested and the billing address for that Sagem phone that was taken from the accused. The Crown relies on the billing address for the Ericsson phone that was also taken from the accused when he was arrested. The Crown relies on the phone number given to Acho in the conversation on 28 January 2005 and the billing address for that phone number which was the same as the billing address for the phone found on the accused when he was arrested. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the evidence of the EMS parcel tracking system about which you have heard. The Crown relies on the evidence of Mrs Colman that on 22nd March the accused came into the newsagency and said to her ‘Box 13’. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the evidence of Mrs Colman that the accused came into the newsagency after the parcel had been delivered and the evidence of Mrs Colman that she had received the parcel earlier and had put it away in the newsagency until it was collected by [a Federal police officer]. 
         
         
        The Crown relies on the behaviour of the accused as seen on the closed circuit TV. The Crown relies on the fact that the lease on Box 13 was taken out in the name of Stephen Michael using a driver's license number that did not exist and the mobile phone number given was in the name of Patrick. The Crown relies on the video footage of the man who attended the newsagency on 14 February 2005 to renew the [lease] for the box and the Crown says that it was the accused.” 
         
        
       
      
    20 In relation to the two telephone calls made from the Wolli Creek phone box the Judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “To prove that the accused is the person talking on the phone call the Crown says that there are events and activities taken by the accused after the phone call which would cause you to accept that he was the person on the phone that he was speaking first to Acho and then to Fedamatic. For example, the Crown says that the person calling from Australia was speaking Ibo, the language of the people of Nigeria. When speaking to Acho the caller gives a telephone number on which he can be contacted and that number is registered to the same address as the Ericsson phone the accused had with him when he was arrested. In the first call to Acho the caller gives an e-mail address which is the same as that found on the Sagem phone taken from the accused when he was arrested………” 
        
       
       
      The Judge directed the jury that, before they could use these phone calls as part of the Crown case against the accused, they had to be satisfied that it was the accused who made the telephone calls and that he was talking about drugs. 
       
      
    21 As to the renewal of the post box on 14 February the Judge told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…………It is the Crown case that it was the accused who went into the newsagency on 14 February and paid for a three-month renewal of the lease of Box 13. It is disputed that it is the accused. In order to resolve the dispute you are entitled to look at the CCTV footage of 14 February. You are entitled to compare that with the CCTV footage of 22nd March. And you are entitled to compare the person who appears in the footage on 14th February with the accused, who is sitting in front of you, and you must determine whether it is the accused who came into renew the lease or not. Once again if you are satisfied that it was the accused who renewed the lease then you may use that evidence as part of the Crown case against the accused. If you are not satisfied that it was the accused then you would put that aside and you could not use that in determining whether the Crown had proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    22 The competing cases put before the jury were summarised by her Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is the Crown case that the accused arranged for drugs to be sent by post to Australia and that the path of the parcel could be tracked using the EMS posting system. The Crown case is that the accused extended the lease on the post box and did it for the parcel to be delivered. 
         
         
        The Crown case is that the accused knew on the morning of 22nd March that the parcel had been delivered by Australia Post and that he came to the newsagency and asked for the contents of Box 13 knowing that the parcel contained drugs and he wanted to take possession of it. It is the Crown case that he knew that it had been delivered. 
         
         
        Now it is the case for the accused that he knew nothing of the contents of the parcel nor did he attempt to take possession of it. The case for the accused is that his words to Mrs Colman ‘Box 13’ are merely a request for information about it and not asking her to hand over the parcel. 
         
         
        It was never suggested that it was the accused who took out the lease in the first place on Box 13 in which the false driver's licence was given. It was suggested to you that his behaviour, as can been seen on the closed circuit TV filmed on 22nd March is one of confusion and is consistent with being confused. It is the case for the accused that he did not make the phone call on 28 January and the defence case was that you could not be satisfied that the accused put the e-mail address on the Sagem phone because the dates were uncertain and you could not be sure that he did that. 
         
         
        It is the defence case that he had nothing to do with the sending of drugs from India to Australia. The defence pointed out to you when the accused was searched on the day and later when his house was searched, nothing was found that would connect him with the posting of drugs or anything to do with the parcel that was sent to Mrs Colman's post box.” 
        
       
      
    23 After the jury had retired to consider its verdict a note was sent from them to the judge with the following question: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In respect of the phone transcript if there may be doubt as to the accused's being the speaker can we still consider the other linkages to the accused contained in the phone conversation and the phone found in his possession?"" 
        
       
       
      The Judge answered the jury’s question the next day as follows: 
       
        
         
        “As I said to you yesterday, the evidence of the phone conversation is one of the pieces of evidence on which the Crown relies. And from which the Crown asked you to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that there were drugs in the parcel. If you decide that the accused is the speaker in the telephone calls then you may use the transcript of the phone conversations as part of the evidence in the Crown case and you may take into account in determining whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew there were drugs in the parcel. 
         
         
        If you decide that the accused was not the speaker in the telephone conversations then you cannot use it as part of the evidence on which the Crown relies to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that there were drugs in the parcel.” 
        
       
      
    24 The appellant filed written submissions with the Court. Firstly he submitted that the Court should not use the contents of the intercepted telephone call on the 28th of January against him because it could not be satisfied as to the identity of the speaker on the Sydney end of the call for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “a. I was not the ""target"" of the interceptions, another Nigerian male living in the vicinity of the intercepted public telephone box was the intended target. 
         
         
        b. My name is never mentioned in the conversation. 
         
         
        c. The Crown did not adduce visual surveillance evidence or direct voice identification evidence connecting me to the call. 
         
         
        d. Clearly audible sounds of background conversations from page 5 of the transcript, together with discernible differences in pitch and lexicon in the voice attributed to “Obasanjo” founds the inference that more than one person was speaking at the Sydney end of the calls itself based on the contents of calls for example, given that background conversation is first audible at the top of page 5 of the transcript (9 min 15 sec into the recording) the possibility that a second person joined the first speaker at the phone box at that point of time is reasonably open on the evidence. There is no safe basis upon which the earlier part of the conversation could be attributed to the second speaker. 
         
         
        2. I would respectfully disagree with the Crown's submission that “the jury appears to have been satisfied that it was me, who arranged by telephone for the parcel to be shipped into Australia”. The note from the jury late in the trial suggesting doubts about the identity of the speakers cannot properly be used to found the submission. It was possible for the jury to convict me without needing to be satisfied that I was “Obasanjo” in the calls. 
         
         
        3. Second, the court could not be satisfied that the said calls relate to the prohibited imports which were subject of the charge. “Acho” tells “Obasanjo” that he will feed you one thing by next week… I will give you everything next week (p4) the package that was the subject of the charge arrived on 22 March 2005, ie almost 8 weeks after the call. The only reasonable inference in the circumstances is that the (sic) did not relate to the subject importation. 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant’s written submissions dealt generally with the case against him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) the Crown did not allege at trial that I was (sic) attended the newsagency prior to 14 February 2005 to rent ""Box 13"". Indeed, evidence supports the inference that another person filled out the initial rental application card. 
         
         
        (b) the search of my house residence did not locate any paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking or supply. It is submitted that there is no evidence that I had the capacity to distribute the drugs. 
         
         
        (c) there was no evidence that I was (sic) possessed significant assets or benefited financially in some way as a result of drug-related activities. 
         
         
        (d) there was no allegation that I was or had recruited others into criminal activity. 
         
         
        (e) there is evidence of another person's involvement in relation to the heroin shipment seized by police. In particular: 
         
        
       
      
    · Another Nigerian male living near the newsagency was the target of the said telephone interception 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Evidence pointed to another person initially renting ""Box 13"" 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · It would seem that there was more than one person speaking on the phone on 28 January 2005.” 
     
      
    26 At the hearing of the appeal the applicant supplemented his submissions with another document. I have perused the document and it is to a large extent merely repetitious of matters that he already relied upon. However he does raise two matters additional to the dot points set out above as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Ms Colman at a number of points in her evidence asserted that a male had attempted to collect the parcel before police arrived and seized it. 
     
      
    · Ms Colman gave evidence that all black men appeared the same to her. 
     
      
    27 All of the points raised by the appellant were raised on his behalf before the jury. They were matters to be taken into account by the jury in determining whether the circumstances relied upon by the Crown gave rise to the only possible inference that the appellant went to the newsagency intending to collect the parcel knowing it contained drugs. The question for this Court is whether the jury were entitled to make that finding by considering all the evidence in the trial as a whole including the evidence that favoured the accused, such as his good character. 
     
      
    28 There was an application made to the Judge that she should exclude the evidence of the telephone calls obtained under the authority of the warrant. The application was based upon a submission that the warrant should have been restricted by reason of the fact that it was attached to a public phone so to limit its operation to those calls involving the target of the investigation and the person mentioned in the warrant. The Judge rejected that application indicating that she would later give reasons. There have been no formal reasons published. 
     
      
    29 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant handed up to the Court the submissions made by his counsel to the Judge in support of the argument that she should reject the evidence of the intercepted conversations. In effect the argument was that the warrant was bad on its face because it was “impermissibly broad” or “excessively wide”. The submission was that because the warrant authorised the police to intercept calls made from a public telephone box over a 90 day period, it was in effect a general warrant and this was not permissible under the relevant legislation. Reliance was placed upon a number of decisions but in particular on the judgment of Temby AJ in Warner v Elder (NSWSC, unreported, 23 April 1997) and the Court of Appeal’s decision in MacGibbon v Warner (1997) 98 A Crim R 450. 
     
      
    30 These decisions concerned a search warrant issued in respect of the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service often known as “the Wood Royal Commission”. The facts before the Court were very different from that in the present case and the authorities relied upon were of significance for no more than a proposition that a warrant could be struck down by collateral attack upon the basis that it was a general warrant and, therefore, invalid on its face. 
     
      
    31 Although the Judge has not given formal written reasons, in admitting the conversations she stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I do not propose to exclude the evidence obtained under the telephone intercept warrant. In my view it is not bad for being a generally (sic) warrant, and it is therefore valid and I will deliver reasons for that judgment later on in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    32 The finding made by the judge is probably the resolution of a question of law, but I am not satisfied that her Honour erred in forming that opinion on the material before her. The offence being investigated was a conspiracy to import drugs and it was open for the person authorising the warrant to come to the view that, in order to properly investigate the allegation, it was necessary for the police to be able to listen to all conversations to sift those that might be relevant to the charge whether those conversations were made by the person named in the warrant or not. The issue was not argued before this Court but I am prepared to assume in the appellant’s favour that such a warrant could be struck down on this basis. However, I do not believe that the warrant was unreasonable, or impermissibly broad or for any other reason should have been found to be invalid. 
     
      
    33 It should be noted that no other objection was raised to the admission of the telephone conversations based upon any provisions of the Evidence Act or otherwise. 
     
      
    34 There are in my view, and with respect, some unsatisfactory aspects of the summing up. I do not believe that the Judge ever answered the jury’s question or at least not in a way that might have been clearly understood by the jury. The jury wanted to know whether, if they had a doubt about the appellant being the speaker on the telephone under the sobriquet of Obasanjo, they could “still consider the other linkages to the accused contained in the phone conversation and the phone found in his possession”. This is obviously a reference to the fact that there were aspects of those mobile phones that related back to the conversations in the phone box: the reference to the e mail address and the similarity of the registered addressed for the Ericsson phone and the number used in the second conversation. 
     
      
    35 There were in my view two aspects of the question that needed to be clearly addressed. Firstly the use of the jury of the word “doubt” seems to me to suggest that they believed that they had to be satisfied of the fact that the applicant was one of the parties to the conversations beyond reasonable doubt. The jury should have been clearly told that they did not have to find that the appellant was a party to those conversations to that standard of proof. Secondly, the jury had to be plainly told, on the view that the Judge and the parties took, that, if they were not satisfied that he was a party to the conversations, the fact that he had those particular mobile phones was irrelevant. They could not make any link between the appellant and the person on the phone by reason of those particular mobile phones. 
     
      
    36 Yet the Judge merely repeated in a formalistic way what she had said earlier in the summing up, that had presumably not been fully understood by the jury. True it may be that, by examining and parsing what the Judge said with the aid of the transcript of her answer, one might by inference derive the answer to the jury’s question, but I doubt it conveyed to the jury what they wanted to know. 
     
      
    37 But of more concern is the fact that the Judge never explained to the jury in precise terms what was left of the Crown’s circumstantial case if the transcript of the telephone conversations could not be relied upon. Yet those conversations and the significance of the mobile phones found in the possession of the appellant was a very important part of the Crown case. The prosecution case would have been very substantially reduced by the omission of the transcript of the telephone calls. The case would then have been based only upon the following facts: that the applicant turned up at the newsagency to renew the lease for three months in circumstances where he was not the original lessee and the extension happened to cover the period when the parcel arrived; the fact that he arrived soon after the parcel was delivered which would show that he had received information that the parcel had arrived; his request for the parcel; and his reaction to the news that the parcel had been taken by police including his behaviour as seen on the video. 
     
      
    38 I am not to be taken to suggest that this was not sufficient evidence to prove the Crown case, but it ought to have been brought home to the jury that, if they omitted the evidence of the transcript of the telephone calls, they had to be satisfied that there was no other inference from the remaining facts other than that the appellant knew the parcel contained drugs. However, defence counsel made no complaint about the directions to the jury, which were probably overly favourable to the appellant. I doubt that the transcript of the telephone calls was inadmissible as part of the surrounding circumstances even if the appellant was not the speaker. But the Crown was prepared to conduct its case on the basis that, if the jury were not satisfied that the appellant was a party to those conversations, they should be ignored. 
     
      
    39 However, in my view it was open to the jury to find that the appellant was the speaker “Obasanjo” and that is a finding I would make. This fact was being used merely as a circumstance to prove the offence against the appellant and not as direct evidence of the offence. Therefore it did not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The jury were entitled to reason backwards, as it were, to identify the appellant as the speaker in those conversations. The conversations on 28 January referred to matters that were connected to the mobile phones the appellant later had in his possession and related to drugs coming from India. He had those phones when he went to obtain a package on 22 March that contained drugs and came from India. The appellant came to pick up the parcel very shortly after it arrived indicating that he must have had information about its delivery. The first conversation referred to the means of monitoring the parcel’s progress. He had also been to the newsagency to renew the lease on the post box on 14 February. He extended the lease even though he was not the person who had taken out the lease initially. The lease was extended to a point past the delivery date of the parcel. 
     
      
    40 As has been noted the appellant never gave an account of his involvement in obtaining the parcel consistent with his innocence. This did not mean that the jury did not have to consider whether there might have been a possible innocent explanation consistent with the proved facts, but when none is proffered by an accused, it is easier for the jury to decide in favour of the Crown that no other possible explanation exists. 
     
      
    41 On the circumstances that I have set out I believe a finding that the appellant attended the newsagency in order to take possession of the package knowing it contained drugs was not unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence. 
     
      
    42 The fact that the package arrived some 8 weeks after the phone call does not seem to me to be a relevant factor. It would not matter that the calls were not in relation to the particular package delivered to the newsagency. It was the connection between a person speaking about the importation of drugs from India and the telephones in the possession of the appellant at a time when on the Crown case he went to collect a package coming from India that had drugs inside it that was the relevant circumstance. 
     
      
    43 The fact that there was nothing found in a search of the appellant’s premises to connect him with the importation or distribution of drugs was a relevant circumstance for the jury to take into account. But that fact did not necessarily displace the other circumstances indicating the appellant’s guilt. Similarly the absence of any evidence to indicate that the appellant had significant assets or the apparent profits from drug trafficking or that he was involved in some other way in criminal activity was merely part of the circumstances that had to be considered along side those relied upon by the Crown. 
     
      
    44 It was not part of the Crown case that the appellant had been the original hirer of Box 13. Nor did it have to be. There was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant did secure the extension of the rental of the box and they had the two videotapes to consider. But again the Crown case would not fail simply because the jury were not satisfied that it was the appellant who visited the newsagency on the date the lease was extended. 
     
      
    45 In the end the significant facts were that the appellant happened to turn up at the newsagency shortly after the package containing drugs imported from India had been delivered, asked for Box 13 from the newsagent and when arrested had mobile phones in his possession which were related to the conversations from Wolli Creek phone box which involved the importation of a substance from India. In my opinion those facts alone were sufficient to justify the jury’s verdict and proved the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. In addition the jury were entitled to take into account his conduct at the newsagency including that, when he was told that the police had the package, he made no inquiry about what package was being spoken about but immediately left the newsagency. 
     
      
    46 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    47 The sentence was well within the range appropriate for the offence committed notwithstanding the applicant’s prior good character. It has often been remarked in this Court that good character is not an unusual characteristic of persons involved in drug importations. This particularly so with couriers or persons collecting drugs. It has also been stated many times that less weight can, therefore, be given to such a factor in light of the seriousness of being involved in the importation of a significant quantity of drugs at any level. 
     
      
    48 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    49 HALL J: I agree with Howie J.

13021,2770010,Yuen v Chan [2016] NSWDC 157,"Judgment


	
	Pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) the parties seek rulings on the capacity of imputations in relation to the two publications the subject of these proceedings. The defendant also makes challenges to the form of certain of the imputations under r 14.28 UCPR.
	
	
	The parties exchanged objections to imputations and, due to the number of imputations the subject of objections, asked me to determine these issues on the basis of those submissions rather than by oral argument, which the parties feared could have taken several hours.
	


The relevant principles


	
	As to capacity, the relevant test in which courts will strike out an imputation on the basis that the matter complained of is not capable, at a threshold level, of conveying an imputation is set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], namely that the determination of capacity at the threshold level is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony”, as well as being a “matter of impression… the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”.
	
	
	Where issues of the form of the imputation arise (such as failure to differ in substance or asserted use of impermissible words) I have had regard to the relevant principles set out in r 14.28 UCPR.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	The reasons given by the solicitors for the defendant for their challenges to the capacity of imputations are scant. In a letter dated 31 May 2016, the defendant’s solicitors provided a list of objections to ten of the fifteen imputations in the first matter complained of and to all of the imputations in the second matter complained of, on the basis that each of those imputations “does not arise”. This submission was made either without explanation at all, or by restating that the matter complained of does not make this particular claim.
	
	
	Objection is also made (principally in relation to four of the imputations in the second matter complained of) that certain imputations do not differ in substance, and to particular words in imputations 13.14 and 13.15 (but not to the use of the word “properly” in imputation 13.8, as to which see the comments about “improperly” and “proper” in decisions such as Morris v Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 28 March 1985). Although some additional comment is provided by way of assistance for some of the imputations, the majority of the submissions provide no further identification of the issues of concern to the defendant.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s counsel’s replies are similarly scant, consisting generally of the statement that the relevant imputation is “pressed” as capable of arising by application of the principles in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd or Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 18, or because it would be “parsimony” to exclude it.
	
	
	Having been given these very general instructions with somewhat limited and unhelpful material, I propose to apply the relevant tests as to form and capacity to the imputations under challenge as best I can in the circumstances.
	


Preliminary observations


	
	The first issue requiring amendment is that the plaintiff should set out each of these publications in chronological order. They clearly follow on from each other and it only causes confusion to have them back to front. The amended pleading I shall require the plaintiff to file should not only set out these publications in chronological order but also number the imputations (a) and (b) in the usual way, so as to avoid confusion with contextual imputations if any are to be pleaded by the defendant.
	
	
	Additionally, the contents of paragraphs 1 to 5 contain historical narrative (for example, that the Goon Yee Tong was established in the nineteenth century, and that the plaintiff held a Fiji Government scholarship) which is unnecessary in defamation pleadings.
	
	
	Finally, as noted in relation to certain of the imputations below, some footnotes to the translation to assist with Chinese sayings and the translation of particular terms (such as the word “generation”) would greatly assist any jury determining the issues in this case.
	


The first matter complained of – 15 February 2015


	
	By way of general observation, the form of drafting undertaken by the pleader in this matter, as well as in the second matter complained of, has been to extract every possible meaning rather than to aim for the sting of what is said. This has resulted in a number of the imputations being of very similar nature and, at times, in certain of the imputations failing to differ in substance.
	


Imputation 9.1 – That he falsely claims to be the trustee for Loong Yee Tong


	
	At page 9 line 27, Mr Chan says that “there is someone who is saying all the time that he is the trustee” (namely that the plaintiff claims to be the trustee for Loong Yee Tong), adding:
	


“I do not know what his intentions are. All of you know in your heart what it is all about.”


	
	The defendant challenges this imputation on the basis that there is no evidence that the plaintiff falsely claimed this. Additionally, whether he said he was the trustee of Loong Yee Tong or the property in dispute is challenged.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Chan’s additional words (set out in the quotation in paragraph 13 of my judgment above) suggest a motive capable of amounting to a false claim of being a trustee. He is saying to the listeners “you know what the plaintiff really means when he says this”.
	
	
	As to the defendant’s second objection, on page 2 at lines 17 to 18 of the transcript, Mr Chan is recorded as saying that Mr Yuen “says he is the trustee for Loong Yee Tong”, and not the property in dispute.
	
	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 9.2 – That he has brought groundless and unnecessary court proceedings against Goon Yee Tong


	
	The defendant complains of the use of “groundless and unnecessary” and the plaintiff responds by suggesting two imputations. However, the real problem with these words is that there is a high degree of similarity between them. The plaintiff is entitled to one imputation and should select which adjective he wishes to use. The issue of capacity, if still pursued, should await the repleading of this imputation.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Imputation 9.3 – That he falsely claims that Goon Yee Tong bought a property illegally


	
	At page 2 lines 10 to 11 Mr Chan says that the plaintiff is suing Gong Yee Tong in his own name “saying that we bought the property illegally”. However, no passage asserting that the plaintiff falsely brings this claim is identified by the plaintiff’s submissions. The assertion that the plaintiff’s contention is incorrect is “in other words false” is of no assistance.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out.
	


Imputation 9.4 – That he is causing problems for Goon Yee Tong by taking it to court


	
	See reasons for imputation 9.5 below.
	


Imputation 9.5 – That he is causing unnecessary expense to Goon Yee Tong by taking it to court


	
	Imputations 9.4 and 9.5 both fail to capture the sting of the matter complained of. The portions of the matter complained of giving rise to imputations 9.4 and 9.5 clearly are the same. Both relate to the difficulties of having to go to court which is said to be a waste of money. In that sense, these imputations do not differ in substance.
	
	
	Imputations 9.4 and 9.5 are both struck out with leave to replead one imputation arising from these passages of the matter complained of.
	


Imputation 9.6 – That he pretends to be a gweilo


	
	No translation footnotes were provided for gweilo (鬼佬; Cantonese; pronunciation [kwɐ̌ɪ lə̌ʊ]), but I note its pejorative meaning as Cantonese slang for “foreigner”. It might be helpful to add this in, even though this term is widely known.
	
	
	The defendant complains that this imputation “does not arise in the general sense pleaded” and is “specific to that meeting”. The plaintiff’s answer is that the general sense is justifiable by statements on page 3 to 4 of the matter complained of, namely that “he understands Chinese but he does not speak Chinese today. He pretends to be a gweilo today.”
	
	
	There are a number of other references to the plaintiff speaking in English at the meeting although the majority of attenders do not understand English and several of those present ask him not to (see particularly page 2, line 26, page 3, line 25). The plaintiff’s explanation is that the matter may go to court and the judge in court does not understand Chinese. This is said in response to the defendant who has just said: “Bully us, we do not understand English”.
	
	
	This imputation and imputation 9.7 both attempt, unsuccessfully, to capture the sting of a Chinese person speaking English at a meeting despite the wishes of the members. It is not literally true that the defendant pretends to be a “gweilo”; the use of the word “gweilo”, like “bully”, conveys a sting of conduct which those who cannot understand English find intimidating. That is conveyed by imputation 9.10. In those circumstances, imputations 9.6 and 9.7 are surplusage and will be struck out.
	


Imputation 9.7 – That he speaks English at association meetings in order to make things difficult for members


	
	See reasons for imputation 9.6 above.
	


Imputation 9.12 – That he did not follow Goon Yee Tong’s constitution when he was its president


	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed for the reasons set out in relation to imputation 9.13 below, and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 9.13 – That he has unconscionable motives for bringing legal proceedings against Goon Yee Tong


	
	This is asserted to arise from the statements on page 7 lines 10, which refers to “conscience”. This portion actually starts earlier, from the statement that now some people are “trying to find a bone in an egg”, making things difficult by suing (which was why the meeting was called), followed by the statement at lines 8 to 12:
	


“I hope the members understand what has happened in the heart [sic]. People do things and the God [sic] is watching, isn’t that the case? One should live by conscience. Sum Yuen has been president before. When he was President, a lot of things were not done according to the rules. Ok, later when the court case finishes, I will write a report telling you all what has happened.”


	
	The use of the word “unconscionable”, a word with specific legal meaning, creates ambiguity for the reasons explained in Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425 at 428-429 and 435, where the term “breach of trust” created a similar problem.
	
	
	Additionally, the sting of what is conveyed is not that the plaintiff had unconscionable motives, but that he was requiring a higher standard of conduct from others than that which he had shown when he was the President. The reference in the translation to “trying to find a bone in an egg” 雞蛋裡挑骨頭) should contain a translator’s note to explain what this (admittedly well-known) Chinese saying means, namely “nitpicking”, a sting which is underlined by the plaintiff having himself, when President, failed to do a lot of things according to the rules. That is in fact what imputation 9.12 says.
	
	
	This imputation is both ambiguous in form and incapable of being conveyed, and is accordingly struck out.  
	


Imputation 9.15 – That he has dishonest intentions for claiming he is the Trustee of Loong Yee Tong


	
	This is asserted to arise from the same portion of the matter complained of as the imputation of behaving unconscionably.
	
	
	For the same reasons as those set out above, I am satisfied that this conduct is captured by imputation 9.12 and that an imputation of dishonesty cannot arise from such generalised comments, the sting of which is that the plaintiff is complaining of the conduct of others when he himself did not follow the constitution. That is not conduct capable of amounting to dishonesty.
	


The second matter complained of – 13 December 2015


	
	The defendant objects to all of the imputations pleaded, in much the same unhelpful manner as the objections to the first matter complained of. The plaintiff’s replies generally fail to identify the page or line number of the portions of the text referred to, which I found unhelpful.
	


Imputation 13.1 – That he will cause significant problems for the next generation of members of Goon Yee Tong by taking it to court


	
	This is a good example of the literal use of words of the matter complained of as opposed to identifying the defamatory sting. However, the defendant’s objection that there is no accusation of giving rise to “difficulties for future generations” is a wilful misreading of the translation from Cantonese, as the word “generation” is referring to the next board, not future human generations.
	
	
	The problem under discussion at this time is that the plaintiff has gone to court to say that “we are not the owners of Loong Yee Tong”, so they have to be split. The trouble was that the plaintiff “knew that we could not split the properties” and this was why he sued (pages 7 to 8). This was the problem facing this board, and was one which had to be resolved by them or the next “generation” of boards would have even more problems.
	
	
	The language of this part of the translation contains a series of references to ancestors and the next generation which in my view require clarification in the text, to avoid confusion by the jury when considering meaning. In the amended statement of claim the plaintiff should clarify what is meant by “generation” on the three occasions on page 7 where this word occurs. It would also help if the translator checked for other words or sayings requiring explanation (such as “trying to find a bone in an egg” referred to above) and footnoted them in the text.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead, which will hopefully be easier to do when a replacement for “generation” can be found.
	


Imputation 13.2 – That, contrary to the terms of the constitution, he caused the constitution of Loong Yee Tong to be changed without obtaining approval of members


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.6 below.
	


Imputation 13.3 – That he has dishonest intentions for bringing legal proceedings against Goon Yee Tong


	
	The defendant submits that “the alleged dishonesty of the action is not alleged or inferred”. The plaintiff submits that the defendant “is again squarely calling the plaintiff’s motives into question” and refers to the submissions made in relation to imputation 9.15.
	
	
	I reject these submissions for the same reason as I rejected the submissions in relation to imputation 9.15. For an imputation of dishonesty to arise, there must be a degree of specificity in relation to the conduct or motives identified in the matter complained of. That is not the case here.
	


Imputation 13.4 – That he has caused unnecessary problems and expense for the Goon Yee Tong by changing the constitution


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.6 below.
	


Imputation 13.5 – That he engaged in illegal conduct by changing the constitution of Loong Yee Tong without following due process


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.6 below.
	


Imputation 13.6 – That he had dishonest motives for changing the constitution of Loong Yee Tong


	
	Imputations 13.2, 13.4, 13.5 and 13.6 set out a series of superficially different acts to the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff’s conduct in changing the constitution – that he had dishonest motives, engaged in illegal conduct by not following due process and failed to advise members as well as causing unnecessary problems and expense.
	
	
	Imputations 13.2 and 13.5 clearly relate to the same conduct (i.e. changing the constitution without telling the members) and do not differ in substance. The use of the word “illegally” is a weasel word and it should be avoided (“due process” is not much better). The same conduct is also asserted to be “dishonest” in imputation 13.6. These three imputations should be struck out with leave to replead one imputation in their place.
	
	
	An imputation that the plaintiff caused unnecessary problems and expense for the Goon Yee Tong by changing the constitution (imputation 13.4) is capable of being conveyed as well as differing in substance, and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.7 – That he managed Loong Yee Tong’s affairs incompetently


	
	The defendant’s objection is that none of this conduct is alleged to have occurred under the stewardship of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s submission is that these difficulties arise due to the past actions of the defendant, a submission arguable given the interwoven nature of the past actions of the plaintiff with the situation that the organisation of which he was once President now finds itself. This is an issue for determination of the tribunal of fact and this imputation, which I am satisfied is capable of being conveyed, will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.8 – That he failed to properly manage Loong Yee Tong’s property portfolio, resulting in a debt of $260,000 for land tax and Council rates and exposing the properties to confiscation


	
	This is an act for which imputation 13.7 is the corresponding condition, and for the same reasons will go to the jury, but the word “properly” is both ambiguous and a weasel word (Morris v Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd) and the imputation should be redrafted to avoid it.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out with leave to replead.
	


Imputation 13.9 – That he stirs up trouble within Goon Yee Tong to waste its time and money


	
	While I accept the defendant’s submission that the portions of the matter complained of giving rise to this imputation are general in nature, it is arguable that they are capable of referring to the plaintiff. Whether or not they do so will be a matter for the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	Imputation 13.9 will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.10 – That he causes trouble within Goon Yee Tong due to his jealousy


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.11 below.
	


Imputation 13.11 – That he causes trouble within Goon Yee Tong due to his selfishness


	
	There is very little difference between jealousy, selfishness and not wanting members of the present committee to do well (which is presumably attributable to jealousy, selfishness or both).
	
	
	Each of imputations 13.10, 13.11 and 13.12 is struck out as not differing in substance, with leave to replead one imputation in their place.
	


Imputation 13.12 – That he causes trouble within Goon Yee Tong because he does not want the present committee to do well


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.11 above.
	


Imputation 13.13 – That by bringing unnecessary proceedings against Loong Yee Tong and Goon Yee Tong he has prevented members’ activities from taking place


	
	See reasons for imputation 13.14 below.
	


Imputation 13.14 – That by bringing unnecessary proceedings against Loong Yee Tong and Goon Yee Tong he is causing damage and messing up activities of members


	
	This imputation is rolled up (i.e. causing damage and messing up activities), and additionally does not differ in substance from imputation 13.13. Both of these imputations are struck out with leave to replead one imputation in their place.
	
	
	The defendant additionally objects to the word “unnecessary”, and I should formally record, in case it occurs in the repleaded imputation, that this word is in fact necessary to encapsulate the sting.
	


Imputation 13.15 – That due to his actions, Goon Yee Tong only has two title deeds instead of three


	
	The defendant submits that the word “actions” should be replaced by “court actions”. I do not consider this necessary as the plaintiff’s actions generally, whether in court or not, have had this effect.
	


Imputation 13.16 – That he causes trouble within Goon Yee Tong because he is crazy


	
	This word occurs in a series of adjectives used to describe the plaintiff’s motivation, namely that he is “very selfish, jealous and crazy” and “couldn’t stand you doing well”. While selfishness, jealousy and resentment of the new committee doing well amount to much the same conduct, “crazy” falls into a different category and is capable of giving rise to a separate imputation. Accordingly this imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.17 – That he is motivated to break up Goon Yee Tong


	
	The defendant submits that this is a reference to scrutinising and challenging a particular ballot and that the plaintiff cannot extend that reference (“better that the association breaks up”) to general conduct. However, the matter complained of goes on to say that the plaintiff “challenges so that we cannot pass and the association will break up” (page 11).
	
	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.18 – That he falsely claims to be the trustee for Loong Yee Tong and has prevented Goon Yee Tong from obtaining its title deeds


	
	While the defendant clearly says, in the matter complained of, that the plaintiff wrote a letter saying “I am the trustee, you cannot give them the title deeds” (at page 12) he did not say that the plaintiff falsely claimed to be the trustee, either in the passage at page 12 or elsewhere.
	
	
	This imputation is struck out.
	


Imputation 13.19 – That he has caused unnecessary expense to Goon Yee Tong by bringing frivolous legal proceedings


	
	While this imputation is very close in content to other imputations pleaded, I am satisfied that it is sufficiently different to be able to be relied upon. The whole of the matter complained of is to the effect that the plaintiff has brought proceedings which are as expensive as they are unmeritorious.
	
	
	This imputation will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 13.20 – That he is not deserving of [sic] remaining as a member of Goon Yee Tong


	
	While the striking out of imputations which are asserted to be rhetorical is a practice which has fallen out of use, the requirement that a plaintiff plead an imputation of sufficient clarity that the defendant should know the evidence upon which to rely to justify the imputation is still an important issue in the determination of the form of imputations.
	
	
	The phrase “not deserving of” is so wide in its import as to be impossible of definition without more information. If that information were provided, it may well be that the act or condition identified would not differ in substance from one or more of the other imputations pleaded.
	
	
	In those circumstances, this imputation is deficient in form for lack of clarity and is struck out.
	


Costs


	
	I reserve the issue of costs.
	


Orders

GROUNDS OF DECISION
1. The accused is a 36 year old man who pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual offences. The first was a charge under s 354 of the Penal Code, Ch 224 relating to the use of criminal force to outrage the modesty of a five year old boy. The second was under s 377 of the same Code for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature, namely, in this case, performing fellatio on the boy. Both offences took place at the same place, same day, same time and on the same victim. The offences took place on 5 June 2001 at 3am in the flat belonging to the boy's parents. The accused was a friend of the tenant of the boy's parents. He had gone there to visit the friend and stayed over for the night. He slept in the living room. The boy and his 7-year old sister slept in their own room on a double-decker bed where the girl slept on the upper deck. At 3am the accused entered the children's room and the offences were committed in the way described in the statement of facts which the accused admitted as follows:
 
""10. The victim was wearing a pair of shorts without any underwear. The accused pulled down the shorts to the victim's thighs. The accused then used his hands to touch and rub the victim's penis. The accused told the victim he was doing some exercise. After a while the accused stopped.
 
11. Thereafter the accused bent his head down and began to suck the victim's penis. After sucking the penis, the accused pulled the victim's shorts back up and left the bedroom. The victim felt pain at his penis.""
 
2. The deed was discovered when the boy's sister awoke and began to cry when she could not find her mother (the family had just taken the children back from a holiday chalet where they had been spending a few days holiday). When the accused heard the crying girl he returned to the children's room and brought the girl to her parents' room. The girl's father then brought her back to the children's room and there found his son ""in a crouching position on his bed"". The boy then related what happened to his parents who lodged a police report leading to the arrest of the accused and the current proceedings before me. 
3. The case itself is not complex, but it posed some important questions as to how the accused ought to be sentenced. He was charged on two different charges arising from the same incident. Generally, and in principle, there is nothing wrong with that if the facts indicate that in the course of a single transaction distinctly different offences were committed and s 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code Ch 68 bears this out.
4. A critical examination of all the materials including the nature of the offence, and the circumstances of the offender and his victim must follow after the presentation of the facts and circumstances of the case so that the court, in punishing the offender, neither falls short nor applies in excess. The court’s duty can only be discharged in the fairest possible way by taking into account the matters that I have averted to above - however laborious or mundane the effort. I now revert to the present case in which the accused is charged with two offences committed within the same minute. I think that it may be as inappropriate to fill a single charge with two offences such that the accused does not know which it is that he has to meet (a procedural irregularity known commonly as 
duplicity
) as it is to create two charges from what is essentially a single offence. I am not here referring to cases in which multiple different offences are committed in the course of a single transaction (for example, the abduction, assault and rape of a victim in the course of a kidnapping) in which the law provides an adequate means of ensuring that the crimes are properly dealt with but with cases such as the present which appears to be a unitary offence. Where the line is to be drawn between these two types of cases depends on the facts and evidence in each case. Where a robber relieves a man of $10 from his left pocket, and then $10 from his right, should he be charged on a single charge of robbing the man of $20 or two charges of robbery of $10 each? Similarly, should a man who beats another a hundred times with a stick on a single occasion be charged on a single count of assault, or a hundred charges of assault? If it forms part of the same incident little distinction can be made to say that the offender paused for breath between each blow. That is not to say that the court will ignore the gravity of the crime. The number of blows and the severity of each blow will be counted in the assessment of all the circumstances of the case and reflected in the severity of the sentence, passed in accordance with established sentencing principles. If what was done was in fact a single offence it will be unfair to leave the offender instead, with a record for having committed 
two
 offences, a small matter that no one else may care about other than the offender himself. Fairness to the offender in this regard does not affect the punishment he deserves or of justice to his victim. It belongs to that meager portion of the case from the situation of the offender that, nevertheless, must not be occluded from judicial reflection.
5. It is the specific facts of the case that determine whether an act is more a unitary offence or a multiple one for the purposes of sentencing. The unitary nature of the offence is apparent where the acts are so closely related in time, motion and space. On the facts before me, I am of the view that the two acts are sufficiently close as to constitute a unitary offence for the purpose of sentencing. The two acts complained of took place at virtually the same time (as can be seen from the charges). The part of the victim’s body violated by the accused is the same. In the circumstances, in view of what I have stated above, the two charges ought to be considered as part of a single offence for the purposes of sentencing.
6. The age of the child, the sex of the child, the manner and duration in which the offence was committed are further matters to be considered. The resilience of a child is sometimes overlooked when the tender psyche of a child becomes the focal point of concern. These are all matters of fact upon which the court must do its best to apportion, based, of course, on what is known before him, eschewing speculations, and avoiding generalizations as far as possible. In sentencing the accused on the two charges that he had pleaded guilty to, I am taking into account a previous conviction of the accused on a charge for outraging modesty and for which he was fined $4,000. There can be no inclination towards leniency on account of his being a first offender because he is not, and so a more severe punishment reserved for a repeat offender must be contemplated. I am grateful to Mr. Wee for the authorities that he had given me in the course of his mitigation speech. I am also grateful to the DPP Miss Ravneet for her helpful submission on sentencing. 
Adam bin Darsin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 412
 is indeed an appropriate case to begin consideration of sentencing in a case such as the present. I need only bear in mind that in the 
Adam
 case the accused committed a series of offences and pleaded guilty to eight with 15 others taken into account. The victims were boys in their teens and therefore much older than the victim in the present case. The Court of Appeal in 
Adam
 also reminds us that the overall gravity of the criminal conduct must be taken into account. The court also laid down the standard of 5 years imprisonment as a starting point for fellatio. Bearing in mind that criminal cases always vary because no two offenders nor their victims, nor the circumstances, are alike, any sentencing guideline from a superior court must always be regarded as a most important factor especially in connecting all the broad clusters of similarities, but must not be taken as an indication that having done so, the individual facts and circumstances of the case need no longer be studied with the view to either varying upwards or downwards from the norm. In sentencing the accused the circumstances and nature of his previous conviction six years ago, and his intoxicated state in that case and this, though of no exculpatory value in my view, is, nonetheless, indicative of an absence of a planned 
modus operandi
 and have been taken into account. They are given their due weight, balanced against the circumstances and age of the victim. 
7. In this case, in view of the fact that the conduct of the accused was encapsulated within the same incident taking no more than a minute apart, and having taken into account the facts including those forming the matrix of the first charge, I am sentencing the accused to one day's imprisonment in respect of the first charge and 6 years' imprisonment in respect of the second charge. The sentence of imprisonment in respect of the first charge shall run concurrently with that of the second charge and shall commence with effect from today. I am not backdating the sentence in this case because I am of the opinion that the 5 months' imprisonment already served should be part of the punishment given the circumstances of this case.

     REGINA v Constantine KARAGEORGE 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Mr Justice Sperling to give judgment in this matter. 
     
      
       
      
    2    SPERLING J: On 21 July 1994, the applicant was charged with offences which included being knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth: Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 29B. The charges related to the applicant's complicity in an attempted fraud on the Australian Tax Office. He was then acting as solicitor for Mr Leonard McPherson and Mr McPherson's wife. He was granted bail. I will refer to this as matter 1. 3    On 24 October 1996, the applicant was charged with offences relating to allegedly false evidence given on 11 July 1996 in an application to vary his bail conditions. He was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in dealings with a journalist, Mr Perkins, in relation to Mr McPherson's pending trial. Bail was refused by the Local Court but granted by the Supreme Court on 31 October 1996. I will refer to these charges as matters 2 and 3. 4    On 14 July 1997, the applicant was charged with a state and a Commonwealth offence relating to an attempt to obtain a false passport with a view to absconding. Bail was refused. I will refer to these charges as matters 4 and 5. 5    On 1 August 1997, bail was revoked in relation to matters 1 and 3. No doubt, bail was refused in matters 4 and 5 and revoked in matters 1 and 3 because the applicant had demonstrated he could not be trusted to attend at his trial for those offences. 6    On 9 September 1997 the applicant was convicted in matter 3 and remanded in custody for sentence. On 20 October 1997, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment commencing on 14 July 1997, that being the date on which he was taken into custody on matters 4 and 5. 7    On 1 June 1998, while in custody serving that sentence, the applicant pleaded guilty in matter 1 and requested that the offences in matters 4 and 5 be taken into account. 8    On 17 July 1998, the conviction in matter 3 was quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and a new trial was ordered. 9    The applicant was now in custody in relation to matter 1, bail revoked, and matters 4 and 5, bail refused. On 2 October 1998, he applied for bail in relation to those matters. Bail was refused. 10    On 20 November 1998, the applicant was convicted in matter 2. On 26 November 1998, he was sentenced by Hidden J to a term of imprisonment of fourteen months, to be released on a recognisance after eight months expiring on 15 July 1999. In fixing the commencement date of that sentence his Honour gave the applicant credit for the applicant's period in custody from the first day of that trial, 16 November 1998. 11    On 17 December 1998, Davidson DCJ sentenced the applicant in matters 1, 4 and 5. He fixed a sentence of twelve months commencing on 15 July 1999 when the applicant was due to be released under Hidden J’s sentence, the applicant to be released on a recognisance after eight months expiring on 14 January 2000. 12    In so doing Davidson DCJ, by agreement, took into account 220 days in prior custody. That was the time in custody from 24 October 1996, when the applicant was charged in matters 2 and 3, and 16 November 1998, the commencement date of Hidden J's sentence, less the period from 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998 when the applicant was serving the sentence in matter 3 later set aside. 13    The present application is for leave to appeal against sentence, on the ground that Davidson DCJ should have given credit for the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998 as well as for the balance of the period 24 October 1996 to 16 November 1998.  14    If that is correct, Davidson DCJ should have fixed the commencement date of the sentence some nine months earlier. That would have more than taken up the period of six months to be served under that sentence before being released on recognisance. In consequence, the applicant would have been entitled to be released in relation to that sentence well before 15 July 1999, the date on which he was entitled to be released under Hidden J's sentence. 15    The applicant's argument should be upheld for the following reasons. During the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998, the applicant was in custody for two reasons each of which was, at the time, sufficient to cause him to be so held. First, bail had been refused in matters 4 and 5 on 14 July 1997 and revoked in matter 1 on 1 August 1997. They were the matters for which he was sentenced by Davidson DCJ on 12 December 1998. Secondly, he was serving the sentence imposed on 20 October 1997 in matter 3. That was the conviction which was subsequently quashed. 16    The applicant would have been held in custody during the period in question because of matters 1, 4 and 5 irrespective of the sentence in matter 3. Bail was revoked in matter 1 and refused in matters 4 and 5 because matters 4 and 5 gave rise to too great a risk that the applicant would abscond if he was released pending his trial in matters 1, 4 and 5.  17    In these circumstances, the period of custody in question is attributable to matters 1, 4 and 5 irrespective of whether it was also the result of matter 3. By contrast, in relation to matter 3, the conviction for which the applicant was serving a sentence during the relevant period was later quashed. 18    In Niass, (CCA, 16 November 1988, unreported), the sentencing judge had refused to take into account time in custody pending trial on other charges of which the applicant had been acquitted. The relevant principle was stated by Lee CJ at CL as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""There have, of course, been cases where credit has been given in sentencing for periods of incarceration arising directly from the commission of the offence which brings the offender forward for sentence and that practice should be followed. The courts recognise that in dealing with a particular offence it is always appropriate to take into account periods during which an appellant has been held in custody in respect of that offence."" 
         
        
        
       The case fell outside the ambit of that principle because the period in custody was not ""in respect of"" the offence for which the applicant was sentenced. In later cases, time in custody has been disallowed for the same reason:  
       Webster 
        and  
       Jones 
        (CCA, 3 August 1992, unreported),  
       Chung 
        (CCA, 9 March 1994, unreported),  
       David 
        (CCA, 20 April 1995, unreported) and  
       Baartman 
        (Dunford J, 18 December 1998, unreported). 
       
      
     19    In Chung, David and Baartman, the judgments show explicitly that there was no overlap between the relevant period in custody, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, any period in custody, bail refused, in relation to the offence for which the sentence was imposed. There is nothing in Niass or Webster and Jones to suggest there was any such overlap in those cases. 20    The Crown submits that to uphold the applicant's arguments would bring the law into disrepute. It argues that, if bail had not been opposed in matters 4 and 5 on 14 July 1997 and if no application had been made to revoke bail in matters 1 and 3, as occurred on 1 August 1997, the applicant would have no ground on which to claim credit for time served in the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998. It is said to be incongruous that credit should be allowed or disallowed for time served in relation to a sentence set aside on appeal depending on whether bail has been allowed or disallowed in relation to the offence in question. 21    I perceive no such incongruity. Sentencing is a discretionary exercise. Fairness and reasonableness have constantly to be borne in mind. It would be unjust to disallow credit for time in custody pending trial because that time overlapped a sentence later set aside. A sentence set aside should count for nothing against the person concerned, let alone operate to negate an entitlement which that person would otherwise have under the law. The need to avoid injustice in this case outweighs, by a large margin, any incongruity that might be perceived as arising from doing so. 22    I do not think it matters that this point was not raised at the sentencing hearing. That was a mistake. It has resulted in a miscarriage of justice which should be rectified.  
     
      
       
      
    23    The court was informed that the appellant would need to apply for a variation of his bail conditions in matter 3 (in which the new trial has been ordered) before he could be released from custody at this stage. That situation has been taken into account in proposing the following orders.  
     
      
       
      
    24    The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. Application for leave to appeal granted. 
        
       2. Appeal allowed. 
        
       3. Sentence set aside. 
        
       4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to twelve months imprisonment commencing on 7 August 1998 and expiring on 6 August 1999, when he is to be released on a recognisance for a period of eighteen months expiring on 6 February 2000. 
       
      
     25    The effect of that sentence is as follows. Provided the appellant is otherwise entitled to be released, he will be released from custody on 6 August 1999 on a recognizance for a period of eighteen months to be of good behaviour, among any other conditions to be determined by the authorities.26    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes.  27    I wish to add two matters. 
     
      
       
      
    28    First, the applicant has sought in these proceedings credit for a period in which he was in custody for two separate reasons: the first of those was his conviction on charges under s.319 of the New South Wales Crimes Act. The court has been informed that a new trial will proceed in this matter within a few months. This court is able to give credit for a substantial proportion but not all of the period of that custody in the form of the order proposed by Justice Sperling. What the implications may be for the sentencing, if he should be convicted again, on the s.319 charges will be a matter for the trial judge on that occasion. For the same reason as he was entitled to credit, notwithstanding the fact he was in custody, in effect, for two different reasons, he would not expect to receive credit twice. 29    The second matter is the fact this was a very clear case. Bail had been refused and, in view of the passport offences, it was a very clear case as to what the prognosis for any bail application or change of conditions would have been. Not all cases will be as clear as this. If this matter arises again, the court would not wish to encourage litigation about what may or may not have been the prospects of bail in a case that is not as clear as this one. Subject to this, I agree with everything said by Justice Sperling.30    SIMPSON J: I also agree with the orders proposed and the reasons given by Mr Justice Sperling and the additional remarks of the Chief Justice.31    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as proposed.

     REGINA v FREDERICK WESTLEY 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 seeking leave to appeal against the refusal of Nash ADCJ to grant a permanent stay of proceedings on an indictment against the applicant, Frederick Westley containing three counts of sexual assault allegedly committed approximately 25-30 years ago. The precise offences charged in the indictment are as follows: 
     
      
    1. Between 27 December 1973 and 2 January 1975 indecently assault female under the age of 16 years with act of indecency contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2. Between 1 January 1974 and 3 February 1975 carnal knowledge of female aged between 10 and 16 years contrary to s 71 of the said Act.3. Between 1 January 1974 and 3 February 1975 assault female under the age of 16 years with act of indecency contrary to s 76. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was charged on 13 October 1999 and committed for trial on 1 March 2002. The application for the stay was filed on 20 January 2003 and judgment delivered on 16-17 December 2003. At the time of the alleged offences, the applicant was aged about 46 or 47 and is now almost 77 whilst the complainant was then aged about 12 or 13 and is now aged 42. 
     
      
    3 The grounds of the application argued before Nash ADCJ were summarised in his Honour’s judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Prejudice to the applicant caused by reason of the very lengthy delay of the commencement of the prosecution, the applicant having been charged on 13 October 1999 that is between about 26 or 25 years after the alleged offences. 
         
         
        (b) The complainant’s treatment by Dr Vaux (likely to cause her to be in an hypnotic state) should in the circumstances result in a finding that she had previously had her memory of the events repressed and then revived, or at least her memory was thereby distorted, therefore all her evidence was inadmissible. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) (Alternatively to (b)) Nevertheless Dr Vaux’ treatment combined with the complainant’s drug abuse, criminal record, the therapy she received from Mr Phiskie, including her at least looking at the later discredited book “The Courage to Heal”, her varying evidence as to her age when the alleged offences occurred, the details given thereof by her to others and her state of memory of associated matters should result in the finding that her evidence is completely unreliable and effectively the prosecution is doomed to fail. 
         
         
        (d) The impact of a trial on the health of the applicant and his wife, who knows nothing of the allegations or pending trial, will be catastrophic and such it would offend common humanity to require him to stand trial. 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant’s case at first instance was that each of the above matters of itself justified a finding that the trial of the applicant would be unfair and result in an order for a permanent stay, but certainly all of those matters combined did so. 
     
      
    5 The grounds of appeal to this Court were more limited and were as follows: 
     
      
    1. That the proceedings were doomed to fail and that the continuation of the trial proceedings is oppressive and amounts to an abuse of process.  
     
      
    2. That, although the learned trial judge did refer to the decision of the High Court in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, he failed to correctly apply the principles set out in that case. 
     
      
    3. That the learned trial judge failed to consider what directions could be drafted to overcome the dangers caused by long delay in complaint, the absence of contemporaneous records, prior disclosures and the history of the mental state of the complainant. 
     
      
    6 There is no further claim that the plaintiff’s treatment by Dr Vaux was likely to cause her to be in a hypnotic state or that her memory of the events in question had been repressed and then revived. Although not the subject of a separate ground of appeal, the applicant sought to argue that the ill health of the applicant and his wife was nevertheless relevant and went to the first ground of appeal on the basis that the trial proceedings would be oppressive and constitute an abuse of process. 
     
      
    7 In her original statement to police dated 24 June 1998, the complainant said that in December of the year she turned 12, which was 1973, her parents had a New Year’s Eve party at their house in Maroubra and that the applicant and his wife were guests. She said that during the night in the car port area, the applicant started to kiss her on the lips and then ran his hand from the top of her thigh into her underpants to between her legs and she felt two fingers penetrate her vagina. 
     
      
    8 She said that in the school holidays following the New Year’s Eve party, she was doing some work for the applicant, who ran a dry cleaning business, delivering pamphlets and doing general cleaning work, and that one day during this period, he drove her in his car to an abandoned army barracks near the corner of Fitzgerald Avenue and Bunnarong Road, Maroubra where there is presently a gymnasium. She said he drove his car into the building and had penal vaginal intercourse with her in the car.  
     
      
    9 As to the third count, she said that on another day, not long afterwards he drove her to the same abandoned army barracks as previously and got her to give him oral sex, resulting in him ejaculating into her mouth.  
     
      
    10 His Honour summarised a number of other relevant facts substantially as follows:· On 31 January 1974, the complainant began her secondary education at Maroubra Bay High School in first form.  
     
      
    · In the summer of the early 1970’s, there was a New Year’s Eve party held at the complainant’s parents’ home in Maroubra. 
     
      
    · Ethel (Schultz) the mother of a friend of the complainant (Heather Schultz) stated that this party was in 1974. 
     
      
    · The complainant’s father remembers the party but he was unable to assist as to when it was but remembers that in the course of a New Year’s Eve party at his home there was a complaint that Heather Schultz had scratched the applicant. 
     
      
    · On 10 October 1977, the complainant left High School when she was in fourth form. 
     
      
    · In 1979, the complainant began a relationship with David Watson. 
     
      
    · In June 1981, the complainant gave birth to twins and with David Watson and the twins moved to Perth. 
     
      
    · In about 1985, the complainant told David Watson that she had been raped by this person when she was 13 to 14 years old. 
     
      
    · On 21 November 1989, Dr Vaux began treating the complainant. 
     
      
    · On 6 February 1995, in the course of either a treatment or consultation, Dr Vaux made a note as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Thinking of “suing” a man who abused her aged 12, was drinking on sly, molested her – also she was employed by him. Three X further, episode of intercourse 2x2/12. Later ran away from home. Sees it as beginning of problems. Did try to do something 8 years ago.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    · In 1996, the complainant rang the Police Royal Commission. She was not informed of any outcome. 
     
      
    · On 10 September 1997, the complainant reported assaults to Snr Const Bassingthwaighte. 
     
      
    · On 17 April 1998, the complainant was referred to the Eastern and Central Area Sexual Assault Service by Maroubra Police after making initial enquiries with them about reporting a sexual assault perpetrator against her when she was in her early teens (13 to 14 years old). 
     
      
    · On 30 April 1998, the complainant began counselling with social worker, Tony Phiskie, who provided her with the book, “The Courage to Heal” for her to read. 
     
      
    · On 24 June 1998, Phiskie accompanied the complainant to Maroubra Police Station where she made a full statement to a police officer in respect of the matters alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    · On 7 October 1999, the applicant was interviewed at his business premises by Detective Pincham. 
     
      
    · On 13 October 1999, the applicant was charged by way of Court Attendance Notice. 
     
      
    · On 20 October 2000, committal proceedings began in the Downing Centre Local Court and the complainant was cross-examined on that day. 
     
      
    · On 6 December 2000, committal proceedings continued. Dr Vaux gave evidence. 
     
      
    · On 1 March 2002, committal proceedings continued with evidence from Dr Roberts. This concluded the committal proceedings and the applicant was committed for trial to the Sydney District Court for arraignment on 8 March 2002. 
     
      
    · On 13 June 2002, an extensive letter was written by the applicant’s solicitors to the Director of Public Prosecutions requesting that the proceedings be no-billed, which request was refused by letter from the Director dated 24 July 2002. 
     
      
    11 In cross-examination at the committal, the complainant conceded that she had a criminal history in Western Australia involving crimes of dishonesty, drug supply and drug possession; and that for a considerable period, she was addicted to drugs and led a criminal lifestyle. 
     
      
    12 In his judgment, Nash ADCJ, after an extensive review of the evidence dealt seriatim with the various grounds of the application. As to the prejudice to the applicant caused by the delay, his Honour referred to Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, R v Nicholson (1998) 102 A Crim R 459 at 467-8, R v Davis (1995) 81 A Crim R 156 and other cases, and noted that delay itself is not sufficient, that actual prejudice by reason of the delay must be shown, and is not presumed, although the longer the delay, the more likely it will be that actual prejudice can be shown. 
     
      
    13 He concluded that the only prejudice to this applicant in a properly conducted trial was such as arose from the delay. His Honour noted that even if the year could not be specifically determined, the occasion of the allegation in the first count was the night of a New Year’s Eve party at the house of the complainant’s parents at which the applicant and his wife were present, and there was no suggestion that there was more than one such occasion, whilst the events charged in the second and third counts were alleged to have occurred in the school holidays of the January following the New Year’s Eve party, whilst the complainant was doing some work for the applicant. 
     
      
    14 On this, or any other point, there was no evidence from the applicant, and the only relevant evidence was from his solicitor, whose affidavit said that he was instructed that the applicant held no work records, appointment books or diaries in respect of any of the periods relevant to the indictment, that all such records as existed had long since been destroyed or lost and that the applicant had since sold his business. His Honour observed that the applicant may not have kept any record of wages paid to the complainant during that period, although the applicant or his wife may have kept a diary which may have recorded the party, but observed that the solicitor’s affidavit did not specify any instructions as to whether or not the applicant had a memory of the particular party, which led him to infer that he probably did have a memory of the party, and of the complainant working for him in the school holidays. 
     
      
    15 As to the second ground (that the complainant’s evidence was inadmissible being based on hypnosis, repressed and revived memory), his Honour reviewed the medical evidence and found the ground not made out. As there is no application for leave to appeal in respect of this ground, it is not necessary to consider it any further. 
     
      
    16 As regards the submission that the applicant’s evidence was completely unreliable and that accordingly, the prosecution was doomed to failure, his Honour reviewed the complainant’s evidence and notwithstanding the various criticisms which could be, and were, made concerning her lifestyle in the intervening years, found that her evidence on the essential matters had the ring of truth about them, although her evidence as to peripheral matters including times, forms of complaint, etc could lead a tribunal of fact to consider the whole of her evidence unreliable, particularly in the light of the numerous directions and warnings which the trial judge would be required to give. However he considered that, particularly if the applicant did not give evidence at the trial, a properly instructed jury could find the applicant guilty of one of more of the offences charged and consequently the proceedings were not doomed to failure. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the health of the applicant and his wife, his Honour referred to R v Hakim (1989) 41 A Crim R 372 and R v Littler (2001) 120 A Crim R 512, and the medical reports which were before him from the applicant’s general medical practitioner, Dr Craig, and concluded that it would not offend common humanity to require him to stand trial, and so it was not one of those rare cases where by reason of health, age and delay, a stay should be granted.  
     
      
    18 He also considered the various grounds in combination and concluded that no basis had been established for permanently staying the proceedings.  
     
      
    19 In R v Kennedy (unrep – NSWCCA – 9 December 1998) at 5, I summarised the principles that apply in respect of appeals of this nature as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the power to grant a stay is discretionary, the ordinary principles relating to appeals in respect of the exercise of discretion apply; see  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 to 5. In  
        R v Alexandroaia  
        (1994) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290, this Court said in relation to appeals on discretionary matters: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure to properly exercise that discretion. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The right to a fair trial is basic to our criminal justice system and to ensure that innocent people are not convicted of criminal offences, a stay of proceedings may be granted to prevent an unfair trial:  
        Jago v District Court of New South Wales 
         (1989) 168 CLR 23. But that right must be balanced against the right of the community to expect that persons charged with serious criminal offences are brought to trial and the grant of a stay of proceedings is discretionary and the circumstances will usually have to be extreme for such relief to be given. The onus lies on the applicant for a stay to demonstrate that the disadvantage or prejudice which he would suffer by refusal of a stay is, in a relevant sense, unacceptable to the extent that the trial would be unfair:  
        R v Helmling 
         (CCA – 11 November 1993) at p 4 and authorities there cited. See also  
        R v Tolmie 
         (CCA – 7 December 1994).” 
        
       
      
    20 The first ground of appeal is something of a “rolled up” ground in that it claims that the prosecution is doomed to fail and that the continuation of the trial proceedings is oppressive and an abuse of process. It was submitted that, because of the delay, any trial of the applicant would be unfair to him, and because the complainant’s evidence was unreliable, the prosecution would ultimately fail and the applicant would be acquitted. In one sense, these submissions are contradictory. The reason why a trial is stayed on the ground that the trial would be unfair to the accused is that it could result in the conviction of an innocent person, but the conviction of an innocent person is not possible if the prosecution is bound to fail. 
     
      
    21 As Brennan J pointed out in Jago at 47, there are a number of circumstances which can present obstacles to a fair trial, such as prior adverse publicity, death or absence of material witness, or absence of competent representation, but they do not cause the proceedings to be permanently stayed. His Honour went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “When an obstacle to a fair trial is encountered, the responsibility cast on a trial judge to avoid unfairness to either party but particularly to the accused is burdensome, but the responsibility is not discharged by refusing to exercise the jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues. The responsibility is discharged by controlling the procedures of the trial by adjournments or other interlocutory orders, by rulings on evidence and, especially, by directions to the jury designed to counteract any prejudice which the accused might otherwise suffer.” 
        
       
      
    22 In the same case, Mason CJ said at 34: 
     
      
       
        
        “To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial “of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences…Where delay is the sole ground of complaint, an accused seeking a permanent stay must be able to show that the lapse of time is such that any trial is necessarily unfair so that any conviction would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.” 
        
       
      
    23 The substance of the applicant’s complaint is that because the applicant has given different versions as to whether she was 12 or 13 or even 14 years old at the time, she is unable to pinpoint the precise year of the New Year’s Eve party at which the first assault occurred and accordingly, the applicant is required to account for a three-year period of his life some 30 years ago and this places an intolerable burden upon him. It was submitted that the indictment already alleges a lengthy period as the dates within which the offences are alleged to have been committed, that this has already been amended once and, if the applicant was in fact 14 years old at the time, it would need to be amended again, and that such amendment would not be granted. It was further submitted that because of the imprecision of the date, he is not able to avail himself of possible alibi witnesses who may have been available if the dates had been specified with precision, and the proceedings brought much more promptly.  
     
      
    24 I am satisfied that his Honour took all these considerations into account. It is not the case that the applicant is being required to account for a three-year period. He is being called upon to recall a New Year’s Eve when he attended a party at the home of the complainant’s parents, and the January school holidays immediately following that party in one of two or possibly three years. There may be some doubt and confusion about which year it was, but there is no doubt about the occasion and the period of the holidays. 
     
      
    25 Moreover, in relation to the second and third counts, not only are they identified as occurring in the school holidays following the New Year’s Eve party previously referred to, but each of them are alleged to have occurred in specific premises at a particular address, namely on the corner of Fitzgerald Avenue and Bunnarong Road, Maroubra where there was formerly an abandoned army barracks, but presently a gymnasium. The applicant who lived and worked in the area for many years is no doubt familiar with the location of the premises and would know whether there was formerly an abandoned army barracks on the site; if he did not know, it could presumably be checked with the local council’s records. He would also know whether he ever drove the complainant in his car inside the said army barracks and if so, for what purpose, as it would be unlikely to be part of her duties to go there whilst employed by him delivering pamphlets.  
     
      
    26 In a case like the present where the occasions and the locations are specifically identified, the actual date is of less importance from the point of view of an accused defending the charges, and if the Crown were to seek to further amend the dates in the indictment to include the possibility that the relevant dates were 1975-6 I for myself see no reason why it would not be proper for such amendment to be allowed, subject to the possible relevance of s 78 of the Crimes Act as it stood at the relevant time, which I deal with separately at the end of this judgment. 
     
      
    27 Of course, in a case such as this where there has been a lengthy delay in complaint in a sexual assault case, the judge would be required to give a direction in accordance with Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, and the other warnings and directions which are conveniently summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60, 54 NSWLR 241 at para [32]. These are the things that the Court can do to prevent the trial being unfair, and provided these warnings are given, the accused will receive a fair trial.  
     
      
    28 His Honour paid particular attention to the prejudice which it was alleged the applicant would suffer by reason of the delay in complaint, and I can see no error in his Honour’s approach or his conclusion. Similarly, he considered the presentation of the complainant as a witness and was not satisfied that the proceedings were doomed to failure, although he accepted that the applicant might be acquitted, which is a very different thing. Once again, I can see no error in his Honour’s approach or his conclusion. 
     
      
    29 The second ground of appeal was that, although the learned primary judge referred to the decision in Jago, he failed to correctly apply the principles set out therein, and reference was made to dicta of Deane J at 60-61. It was submitted that the effect of that passage is that a judge considering an application for a stay must consider: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. the length of the delay; 
         
        ii. the reasons for the delay; 
         
        iii. the responsibility of the accused for the delay; 
         
        iv. the proven or likely prejudice occasioned to the accused; and 
         
        v. the public interest in the disposition of serious offences and the conviction of those guilty of crime. 
        
       
      
    30 However, although his Honour described these “five heads” as providing convenient reference points to determine whether the effect of the delay in a particular case will necessarily lead to an unfair trial, his Honour went on to say at 61: 
     
      
       
        
        “They should not however be treated as a code or permitted to divert attention from the fact that what will ordinarily be involved in answering that question is the formation of a value judgment in the context of the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence and having regard to all other relevant circumstances.”  
        
       
      
    31 And his Honour had previously said at 60:  
     
      
       
        
        “An order that proceedings be permanently stayed will only be justified in the exceptional cases which I have indicated namely, where it appears that the effect of the unreasonable delay is, in all the circumstances, that any subsequent trial will necessarily be an unfair one or that the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly oppressive that it would constitute an abuse of process.” 
        
       
      
    32 In the present case, Nash ADCJ did take account of the length of the delay whilst the reason for the delay namely the failure of the complainant to complain earlier, and the fact that it was no responsibility of the applicant were obvious. His Honour paid particular attention to whether there was any proven or likely prejudice occasioned to the accused by the delay which could not be cured by appropriate directions. Although not expressed, it is implicit in his Honour’s judgment that he had in mind the public interest in the conviction of those guilty of serious crime; and in any event, a failure to take this factor into account could not be any disadvantage to the applicant. I can see no basis on which it can be said his Honour misapplied the ratio in Jago’s case. 
     
      
    33 The third ground of appeal was that the learned primary judge failed to consider what directions could be drafted to overcome the dangers caused by the long delay in the complaint, the absence of contemporaneous records, prior disclosures and the history of the mental state of the complainant. The short answer to this ground is that his Honour was not asked to consider what directions could be drafted to overcome any dangers occasioned by the delay or the other matters referred to. What his Honour did say was that various warnings and directions would be necessary, but it was not his task but that of the trial judge, to draft and give the appropriate directions. As I have already pointed out, a catalogue of the necessary directions has been set out in R v BWT and the necessary requirements of the Longman direction are summarised by Sully J in that case at para [95] (3), approved by Kirby J in Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45, 210 CLR 285 at [55]. 
     
      
    34 The other ground on which it was alleged the prosecution of the applicant was oppressive was the ill health of himself and his wife. 
     
      
    35 His Honour had before him four reports by the applicant’s general practitioner, Dr Peter Craig dated respectively 19 October 1999, 14 April 2002 and 31 January and 1 September 2003. The relevant parts of his last report were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have stated in my previous letters, dated 19 October 1999 and 14 April 2002, Mr Westley suffers from advanced coronary disease. His condition has been stable since his coronary artery bypass surgery, in that he has not required further hospitalisation, though he remains symptomatic. Principally Mr Westley suffers from chest pain and palpitations usually brought on by emotional stress. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Westley’s wife, Marie, is also my patient. She suffers from hypertension and two years ago was profoundly ill with viral pericarditis. Mrs Westley has remained unaware to date that her husband is involved in criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, Mr Westley’s heath has been very significantly adversely affected by the emotional burden of facing criminal charges, particularly without the understanding and support of his wife. I am extremely concerned that the immediate prospect of criminal conviction and imprisonment may suffice to precipitate a life-threatening cardiac event. Manifestly then, the trauma of a trial and actual incarceration would amplify the risk such an event. 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, I consider that the revelation to Mrs Westley of her husband’s legal predicament would be apt to precipitate in her an exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Similarly, the experience of her husband facing trial, or the ongoing stress of his imprisonment would place her at greater risk.” 
        
       
      
    36 Both before Nash ADCJ and before us, the applicant relied on what was said in R v Hakim (1989) 41 A Crim R 372. In that case, not only did the applicant have a long history of ischemic heart disease, complicated by a complete heart block, but suffered a range of physical, neurological and psychological conditions and his memory had been affected by his condition and subsequent treatment. Lee J held that to allow the charges to stand in the light of the medical evidence and the applicant’s continuing deterioration would be “out of accord with common humanity” when he had already to some extent suffered “prejudice in regard to his memory” on account of the delay. The Court of Appeal held that there was no error of principle in this approach and there was material to support the decision, but Kirby P did say at 377: “It will be a rare case that intervening illness or the physical or mental condition of the accused will bring a court to such a conclusion” i.e. that it would offend common humanity to allow the prosecution to proceed. 
     
      
    37 A stay of proceedings was granted in R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173, 120 A Crim R 512 where the applicant was aged 74 and in ill health with memory problems and there had been a delay of between 38 and 46 years since the time of the alleged offences. In addition, much evidence (including from potential witnesses) was no longer available. 38 On the other hand, in R v Austin (1995) 84 A Crim R 374, Owen J in the Supreme Court of Western Australia held that the poor health of the 87 year old applicant in that case facing sexual assault charges between 13 and 45 years old with his impaired capacity to organise information and recall events was relevant to how the trial should be run and how the jury should be directed, rather than compelling a conclusion that any trial must necessarily be unfair. 
     
      
    39 Littler and Austin were both cases where the applicant was having memory problems. That is not claimed in the present case. Nash ADCJ had Dr Craig’s reports before him, he had regard to the test laid down in Hakim namely, whether to allow the charges to continue would be “out of accord with common humanity” and concluded that it would not. In my opinion, such a view was open on the evidence and no error calling for the intervention of this Court has been shown. 
     
      
    40 Certainly the applicant has health problems, but all the doctor could say is that the stress of a trial might cause his condition to deteriorate, not that it would or probably would, and not to what extent or with what consequence. Whether the applicant confides in his wife about the trial is a matter for him, notwithstanding her ill health. That may not necessarily be the reason he has not confided in her to date. 
     
      
    41 During the hearing of the appeal, attention was for the first time directed to the provisions of s 78 of the Crimes Act (since repealed) which provided that no prosecution for an offence under various sections including ss 71 and 76 could be commenced after the expiration of 12 months from the date of the alleged offence if the person upon whom the offence was alleged to have been committed was at the time of the alleged offence over 14 and under 16 years of age. The Court thereupon gave leave to the parties to file additional written submissions in respect of this issue, and such submissions have now been received.  
     
      
    42 The offence charged in the first count is alleged to have been committed at a New Year’s Eve party on the 31 December 1973 or 1974, whilst the offences charged in counts 2 and 3 are alleged to have been committed in January 1974 or January 1975. The complainant was born on 19 September 1961 and consequently was 12 or 13 years old at the dates specified in the various counts. 
     
      
    43 However, if the events alleged took place on New Year’s Eve 1975 and in January 1976, the plaintiff was 14 years old at the time and the prosecutions are statute barred because, although the section has been repealed as from 3 May 1992, the applicant retains the benefit of the limitation period: Rodway v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 515 at 518. The question therefore arises in the context of the present proceedings whether the available evidence is capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was less than 14 years at the time of the alleged offences i.e. that they occurred in the summer of 1973/74 or that of 1974/75 rather than during 1975/76. If the evidence is so capable, it is a matter for the jury to determine, together with the other elements of the offence; but if incapable of excluding the reasonable possibility that the complainant was in fact 14 years of age at the time, the prosecution is doomed to failure and the applicant is entitled to a permanent stay. 
     
      
    44 A number of witnesses described the relevant New Year’s Eve party as being in the “early 1970’s” or when the complainant and the other children were “about 12” and this suggests that it was 1973. The complainant, in her statement of 24 June, firmly asserted that the party was in the December of the year she turned 12 years i.e. that is 1973. In her evidence on the application for a stay, she confirmed that the party was in 1973, and later said she was 12 or 13 at the time, but in cross-examination, she conceded that she possibly told her former husband that she was 13 or 14 at the time the incident occurred and she said that she believed she was in second form in the summer holidays of 1973/74 when the incidents took place, although other evidence established that she was in second form in 1975. It was suggested to her in cross-examination that she told Mr Phiskie, a counsellor, that it occurred when she was 13 or 14 and she agreed that could be the fact, and that Mr Phiskie’s notes revealed an allegation that the events occurred “when she was in her early teens (13-14)” although a later reference records “about 13”. 
     
      
    45 The Crown concedes that although the general thrust of the evidence is to the effect that the complainant was under 14 years at the relevant time, such evidence is realistically incapable of proving that fact beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    46 The Crown therefore seeks to adduce fresh evidence, being a further statement by Dr Leslie Muzikants, who as a child attended the New Year’s Eve party, which she previously described as being “in the early 70’s”. She now dates the New Year’s Eve party as either 1973 or 1974 by reference to a particular dress she remembers wearing at that time, and to the fact that by Christmas/New Year 1975 she herself was 16 years old, dating boys and not attending parties at the complainant’s parents’ home. This evidence, if accepted, along with the other evidence on the stay application supports the proposition that the complainant was under 14 at the relevant time, but whether it would be capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt may be another matter. 
     
      
    47 Dr Muzikants further says that when the complainant was 14, she had gone “off the rails” and had run away from home and that she dropped out of High School in Year 3 (which would be 1976), but Counsel for the applicant seeks to rely on school records by way of fresh evidence indicating that the complainant left school in Year 4 in October 1977; although it occurs to me that if she was truanting and running away from home, the date recorded may not be a true indication of when she last attended school. The applicant therefore submits that the evidence is still incapable of satisfying a jury to the necessary standard of the complainant’s age at the relevant date.  
     
      
    48 This Court has a general power to admit fresh evidence in appeals under s 5F, but that section covers a variety of interlocutory appeals whereas, as noted earlier, the issue for this Court on appeals in respect of applications to stay proceedings is whether the primary judge has erred in the exercise of his discretion. The limitation period mandated by s 78 was never referred to or considered by Nash ADCJ so he could not have erred in respect of it. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the uncertainty of the dates of the alleged offences was an issue before his Honour but that was in a different context namely, whether the uncertainty as to the dates in respect of a period so long ago imposed an unreasonable burden on the applicant in seeking to defend himself, not on whether the Crown could satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged offences were committed before the complainant’s 14th birthday.  
     
      
    49 As I am satisfied there was no error on the part of Nash ADCJ and the appeal is from the exercise by him of a discretion, the appeal should in the ordinary course of events be dismissed, but because of the fresh issue raised in relation to s 78, I was inclined to remit the application to the District Court so that it could fully consider that fresh issue. 
     
      
    50 However, I have ultimately come to the conclusion that all the available evidence including the fresh evidence before us, is incapable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was under 14 years at the time of the alleged offences, so that the prosecution is ultimately doomed to failure and to remit the matter to the District Court would, in these circumstances be a waste of time and serve no useful purpose. 
     
      
    51 For these reasons, application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed, the order of the District Court set aside and in lieu thereof it be ordered that the prosecution be permanently stayed. 
     
      
    52 HIDDEN J: I agree with Dunford J. 
     
      
    53 ADAMS J: I also agree with Dunford J.

Belinda Ang Saw Ean J: 

Introduction 

1 

The plaintiff is a 38 year-old female suffering from lung cancer. She is 

suing Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd (“the Hospital”) and three  doctors for 

their negligent failure to diagnose and treat a nodule in her right lung during her 

respective consultations with  them  in the five  years before she was  clinically 

diagnosed with cancer after a biopsy performed in 2012. 

2 

The first defendant is the Hospital. The second defendant is Dr Imran 

bin Mohamed Noor (“Dr Imran”), a respiratory specialist, who was an associate 

consultant in  the Hospital’s department  of respiratory medicine  and who saw 

1
--------

Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
the plaintiff on 15 November 2007. The third defendant is Dr Yap Hsiang (“Dr 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Yap”), who attended to the plaintiff at the Hospital’s accident and emergency 

(“A&E”)  department  on  29  April  2010  as  a  medical  officer.  The  fourth 

defendant, Dr Soh Wei Wen Jason (“Dr Soh”), also a medical officer, attended 

to the plaintiff in the same A&E department over a year later, on 31 July 2011. 

The second to fourth defendants are collectively referred to as “the defendant-

doctors”. 

3 

The plaintiff argues that the presence of the singular pulmonary nodule 

on her chest x-rays taken at different time points warranted follow-up actions 

which the defendants failed to carry out. Had the nodule (at the mid-zone of the 

right lung) been investigated and assessed sooner than 16 February 2012, when 

a biopsy of the nodule was performed, her cancer would have been treated and 

her medical outcome would be different today. The plaintiff maintains that the 

delays in the discovery of the nodule’s malignancy caused her injury for which 

she claims substantial damages in this action. The defendants deny that they are 

liable to the plaintiff. 

4 

In this judgment, I will start by discussing the cause and development of 

the plaintiff’s cancer. I will make findings on whether the nodule was malignant 

since October 2007, as the plaintiff claims, or whether it was benign but turned 

malignant  after  31  July  2011.  These  findings  are  relevant  to  the  question  of 

causation  and  loss.  I  will  comment  on  the  plaintiff’s  treatment  and  medical 

management  of  the  nodule  as  it  featured  heavily  in  the  evidence  and  the 

plaintiff’s  case.  The  plaintiff’s  assertions  essentially  require  pre-symptomatic 

detection  and  treatment  of  a  young  person  under  35  years  of  age,  with  no 

symptoms of lung cancer, and who had declared herself as a non-smoker. I will 

examine the defendant-doctors’ alleged breaches in relation to their individual 

 

2
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v

consultations with the plaintiff in the light of her assertions on the one hand, and 

[2018] SGHC 35 

the  defendant-doctors’  evidence-based  assessment  and  management  of  the 

nodule on the other hand. For the defendants, their argument is that there was a 

low index of suspicion for malignancy on the occasions each of the defendant-

doctors saw the plaintiff. This judgment will also examine the plaintiff’s claim 

that  her  cancer  could  have  been  slow-growing  and  the  validity  of  the 

defendants’ case that the knowledge that slow-growing lung cancers existed and 

were more common than previously thought only began to gain traction in the 

medical  community  from  around  2013.  The  defendants  say  they  cannot  be 

faulted for not assessing the plaintiff’s nodule based on medical knowledge that 

was not available to them at the material time, ie, from 2007 to 2011. 

5 

The  plaintiff  is  represented  by  Mr  Vijay  Kumar  Rai  (“Mr  Rai”).  Ms 

Kuan Boon Theng (“Ms Kuah”) acts for the Hospital and Mr Lek Siang Pheng 

(“Mr Lek”) acts for the second to fourth defendants. 

The plaintiff’s medical condition 

6 

The plaintiff was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer in 2012 by 

Adjunct Assistant Professor Sridhar Venkateswaran (“A/Prof Sridhar”) in the 

Hospital, following a biopsy of a nodule in her right lung. It was subsequently 

determined  in  December  2014  to  be  an  anaplastic  lymphoma  kiyenase 

(“ALK”)-positive  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  meaning  that  the  cancer  was 

caused by an abnormal gene fusion in the plaintiff’s body, which was known to 

be  able  to  transform  benign  cells  to  malignant  (ie,  cancerous)  cells.  Detailed 

medical  evidence  was  led  in  relation  to  the  development  of  the  nodule  from 

2007 to 2012 and the cause and progress of the cancer.

7 

The nodule in the plaintiff’s lung was first noted by Dr Yeo Cheng Hsun 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Jonathan (“Dr Yeo”) in October 2007. The plaintiff went to the Hospital’s A&E 

department  at  around  4am  complaining  of  lower  chest  pain  and  shortness  of 

breath. Dr Yeo recorded that the plaintiff was a non-smoker and ordered a chest 

X-ray  for  her  (“the  October  2007  X-ray”).  He  reviewed  it  together  with  Dr 

Steven Lim Hoon Chin. Both noted that there was an opacity in the right mid-

zone  of  the  plaintiff’s  chest.  Dr  Yeo  diagnosed  her  presenting  complaints  on 

that  occasion  as  a  possible  case  of  gastritis  and  prescribed  her  medication 

accordingly.  The  incidental  finding  of  the  opacity  was  unrelated  to  the 

plaintiff’s  presenting  symptoms  but  Dr  Yeo  referred  her  to  the  Hospital’s 

department of respiratory medicine to review the opacity for good measure. 

8 

Two weeks later, in November 2007, the plaintiff went to the Hospital’s 

specialist  outpatient  clinic  for  respiratory  medicine  and  consulted  the  second 

defendant, Dr Imran, a respiratory physician. Dr Imran noted that the plaintiff 

had  already  seen  A&E  for  chest  pain,  had  no  other  respiratory  problems,  no 

weight loss, no loss of appetite, no fever or cough, and clear lungs. He reviewed 

the  plaintiff’s  October  2007  X-ray,  noted  an  opacity  on  her  right  lung,  and 

ordered  a  repeat  chest  X-ray  in  an  erect  view  and  a  right  lateral  view  (“the 

November 2007 X-ray”). He reviewed the wet films on a light box, concluded 

that no obvious nodule was noted on the November 2007 X-ray, and gave the 

plaintiff an open date for follow-up. This meant that the plaintiff could return to 

him for a follow-up if she felt unwell. 

9 

The plaintiff made a few other visits to the Hospital’s A&E department 

in  the  next  few  years,  although  she  claims  only  against  two  doctors  who 

attended to her during her visits in 2010 and 2011. She consulted with Dr Yap, 

the  third  defendant,  in  April  2010,  with  complaints  of  right  lower  chest  pain 

 

4
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
with shortness of breath. Dr Yap ordered a chest X-ray (“April 2010 X-ray”) 

[2018] SGHC 35 

and spotted the nodule in her right lung as an incidental finding. He retrieved 

the October and November 2007 X-rays and assessed that the nodule was stable 

with  no  clinically  significant  changes  and  her  presenting  symptoms  were  not 

related to this incidental finding. After discussing with the senior consultant on 

duty, Dr Mohan Tiruchittampalam (“Dr Mohan”), he sent the April 2010 X-ray 

for reporting, discharged the plaintiff and advised her to return if her symptoms 

persisted or worsened. Around a year later, the plaintiff visited the Hospital’s 

A&E department with complaints of left lower ribcage pain. Dr Soh, the fourth 

defendant, attended to her and ordered another chest X-ray (“July 2011 X-ray”) 

in erect and left oblique views. He missed the nodule in the plaintiff’s right lung, 

diagnosed  her  pain  as  musculoskeletal,  and  after  discussing  with  the  senior 

doctor on duty, Dr Lim Ghee Hian (“Dr Lim”), he discharged the plaintiff with 

painkillers, advising her to return if her symptoms persisted or worsened. 

10 

In  November  2011,  the  plaintiff  went  to  a  Raffles  Medical  Clinic 

complaining  of  cough,  breathlessness  and  blood  in  her  sputum.  Dr  Melvyn 

Wong (“Dr Wong”), who attended to her three times over the next one and a 

half weeks, initially treated her with cough medication. The plaintiff returned 

three days later still complaining of cough with blood. Dr Wong then ordered 

an X-ray (“December 2011 X-ray”) and observed an opaque lesion in the X-ray. 

He gave her a cough suppressant and antibiotics. He received the X-ray report 

a  week  later,  which  confirmed  the  presence  of  a  round  patch  and  ill-defined 

shadows at the mid-zone of the right lung and stated that “this is likely to be the 

result of infection”. Dr Wong then referred her to a respiratory physician at the 

Hospital for further evaluation.

11 

A/Prof Sridhar attended to the plaintiff and ordered a number of tests, 

[2018] SGHC 35 

including a Computed Tomography (“CT”) chest scan and another chest X-ray 

(“second December 2011 X-ray”). The radiologist conducting the CT scan was 

Dr Elizabeth Chan (“Dr Chan”). The CT scan revealed a lesion that appeared to 

be  a  pulmonary  hamartoma  (ie,  benign  lesion),  but  Dr  Chan  recommended  a 

biopsy  for  “baseline  histological  correlation”  because  of  the  lesion’s  interval 

increase in size, lobulated margins, pleural tagging and the plaintiff’s smoking 

history.  As  Professor  Goh  Boon  Cher  (“Prof  Goh”),  the  defendants’  expert, 

explained,  baseline  biopsy  was  recommended  by  Dr  Chan  because  there  had 

been no previous biopsy. The biopsy was hence intended to establish a baseline, 

a starting point, for the plaintiff’s nodule, so that future comparisons could be 

made should there be any subsequent changes to the nodule.  

12 

Dr  Andrew  Tan  (“Dr  Tan”)  carried  out  the  biopsy  in  February  2012, 

which revealed that the plaintiff had lung cancer. A/Prof Sridhar broke the news 

to the plaintiff but assured her that her likelihood of total recovery was high and 

referred her to consider a lobectomy (removal of a part of the affected lung). 

Before  the  lobectomy,  she  was  clinically  staged  as  Stage  I,  which  was  early 

stage cancer. The plaintiff underwent a right lobectomy in March 2012. After 

the lobectomy, she was diagnosed as Stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer and 

attended follow-up medical  care  and treatment  by  A/Prof  Koong Heng  Nung 

(“A/Prof  Koong”)  and  Dr  Daniel  Tan  Shao  Weng  (“Dr  Daniel  Tan”).  She 

underwent chemotherapy for around four months.  

13 

Although her tumour was removed in the 2012 lobectomy, the plaintiff 

suffered a relapse of her cancer two years later in August 2014. She underwent 

a biopsy, which revealed that she was at Stage IV. In December 2014, under Dr 

Daniel Tan’s care, analysis was carried out on her resected tumour from 2012. 

 

6
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
It  was  found  to  be  positive  for  a  rare  echinoderm  microtubule-associated 

[2018] SGHC 35 

protein-like 4 (“EML4”)-ALK gene rearrangement (explained at [24] below). 

The same pathological analysis could not be carried out on the plaintiff’s 2014 

tumour because the size  of the tissue sample  was too  small  for the test to be 

carried out, but Dr David Breen (the plaintiff’s expert) (“Dr Breen”), Prof Goh 

and Dr Daniel Tan all agree that the plaintiff’s cancer in 2014 is likely to be a 

relapse or recurrence of the ALK-positive cancer she suffered in 2012, and I so 

find. This is because of the relatively short time between the first and second 

occurrences (two and a half years) and the plaintiff’s good response to ALK-

inhibitors in the clinical trials, suggesting that her cancer is still driven by the 

ALK gene fusion. 

14 

The  plaintiff  started  on  a  second-generation  ALK-inhibitor,  Ceritinib 

and Nivolumab, in  July  2015 as part of  a clinical  trial.  She remained on  that 

treatment for over a year until October 2016, when the cancer started to progress 

into her brain and mediastinal lymph nodes. She was then taken off the clinical 

trial  and managed with  radio  surgery to  the brain lesions,  chemotherapy,  and 

Ceritinib.  Since  March  2017,  the  plaintiff  has  been  treated  with  Lorlatinib,  a 

third-generation ALK-inhibitor, as part of an expanded access program, which 

is also likely to be sponsored, but this is unclear from the evidence. 

Issues before the court 

15 

The plaintiff essentially alleges that the defendants’ negligent delays in 

detecting  her  malignancy  from  2007  to  2011  caused  her  to  go  untreated  and 

allowed  the  malignancy  to  grow,  undetected  and  untreated,  and  for  her  to 

progress from Stage 0 or I to Stage IIA lung cancer, aggravating and prolonging 

her suffering and causing her condition to deteriorate. Although she has pleaded 

that the defendants also owe her contractual obligations, she has not adduced 

 

7
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
evidence of the terms of such contracts and how they differ from the defendants’ 

[2018] SGHC 35 

duty to her in the tort of medical negligence. As the plaintiff has failed to present 

any such evidence and has dropped this claim in her closing submissions, I will 

not deal with the claim in contract any further. 

16 

For her claim to be made out, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving 

her assertion as set out in [15] above, and that the defendants’ alleged breaches 

of  duty  caused  her  to  suffer  loss,  in  this  case  the  loss  of  a  better  medical 

outcome. I propose to deal with the issue of the nodule’s malignancy first. The 

plaintiff alleges that the nodule was malignant since 2007.  If it is established 

that  the  plaintiff  did  not  have  lung  cancer  when  she  consulted  with  the 

defendants in 2007, 2010 and 2011 respectively, the defendants could not have 

delayed the diagnosis of a cancer she did not have at the material time, and have 

thus  not  caused  her  any  loss  related  to  and  stemming  from  her  cancer. 

Accordingly, the issue of causation will be resolved with a finding on whether 

the nodule was malignant at various time points. However, if causative breach 

is established, the other issue is whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover what 

she  has  claimed  as  damages.  In  addition,  both  Ms  Kuah  and  Mr  Lek  raised 

contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff to reduce the percentage of 

liability and, hence, the quantum of damages recoverable.  

Did the plaintiff have cancer at the material time? 

General comments 

17 

Before I go into the evidence, I note that the terms “nodule”, “lesion” 

and “opacity” were used frequently and without much consistency. I accept the 

witnesses’ evidence that the terms are similar and sometimes interchangeable, 

but that “opacity” and “lesion” are generic terms which would cover anything 

 

8
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
such as fat, pus, a growth, or a nodule, caused by anything from an infection to 

[2018] SGHC 35 

a tumour. The term “nodule” is more specific and refers to a three-dimensional 

lesion or lump, which may be a growth (ie, containing cells). In this judgment, 

I  will  use  the  term  “nodule”  for  consistency  unless  the  specific  term  used  is 

material. 

18 

Dr  Breen  used  the  term  “tumour”.  Mr  Lek  for  the  defendant-doctors 

objected to this terminology because until the abnormality on the right lung was 

biopsied in February 2012, the abnormality was not a “tumour” in 2007, 2010 

or in 2011.  

19 

Save  for  the  November  2007  X-ray,  the  other  X-rays  (namely  the 

October 2007 X-ray, the April 2010 X-ray and the July 2011 X-ray) were taken 

to diagnose the complaints of the plaintiff on the occasions she attended at the 

Hospital’s A&E department. In this context, the nodule was found by accident. 

The  CT  scan  of  the  nodule  was  in  December  2011  and  it  was  biopsied  in 

February  2012.  Dr  Breen,  the  plaintiff’s  expert,  a  respiratory  physician  from 

Ireland, opines that having not seen clinical evidence that the nodule was benign 

from 2007 to 2011, the defendants are required to manage the plaintiff as if the 

nodule  was  malignant.  However,  the  defendants  disagree  with  this  thinking. 

Based  on  their  respective  experts’  testimonies  (radiological  and  oncological 

opinions of the nodule), they argue that the plaintiff’s nodule was benign from 

2007 to 2011, before turning malignant after the plaintiff consulted Dr Soh. This 

was largely due to the nodule’s stability in size and growth from 2007 to 2011, 

contrasted with its aggressive nature in 2012.  

20  More fundamentally, ALK-positive lung cancers (which the plaintiff is 

suffering from) were only discovered around 2007 and 2009 and the testing for 

 

9
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
such cancers only became mainstream around 2014 in Singapore. This meant 

[2018] SGHC 35 

that even when the plaintiff’s cancer was diagnosed in 2012, her ALK-positive 

status of her cancer was still unknown, and was only established in 2014. This 

is three years after her last consultation with Dr Soh in July 2011. 

21 

It is not disputed that the plaintiff is suffering from ALK-positive non-

small cell lung cancer. The plaintiff claims that her nodule was malignant since 

2007. As it is the plaintiff’s claim in negligence, the legal burden is on her to 

prove her cause of action. Thus, she bears the burden of proving that she had 

cancer when she consulted with the respective defendant-doctors in 2007, 2010 

and 2011. Section 103(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) states that 

whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal liability, dependent 

on  the  existence  of  facts  which  he  asserts,  must  prove  that  those  facts  exist. 

Sections 104 and 105 are also relevant. All said, the plaintiff has to prove her 

case. In particular, she has to prove that the nodule in her lung was malignant at 

all of those points in time.  

22 

As for the defendants, they have not only denied the plaintiff’s claim but 

raised a positive assertion in their defence to defeat the plaintiff’s case, namely 

that the plaintiff’s nodule was benign and only turned malignant post July 2011. 

If  they  succeed  in  raising  this  defence,  it  would  necessarily  undermine  the 

plaintiff’s assertion that her cancer was malignant, and she would fail to fulfil 

her burden of proving that she had cancer at all the material times.  

The expert evidence 

23 

Expert evidence was adduced by both parties in relation to the cause and 

development of the plaintiff’s cancer. The plaintiff’s expert witness, Dr Breen, 

is  the  lead  respiratory  physician  for  lung  cancer  services  and  a  consultant  in 

 

10
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
respiratory  medicine  in  Galway  University  Hospital  in  Ireland.  His  primary 

[2018] SGHC 35 

specialty  is  the  diagnosis  and  staging  of  lung  cancer.  Patients  suspected  of 

having lung cancer are referred to Dr Breen, who then investigates, diagnoses, 

stages and decides on the management of the particular lung cancer. Prof Goh, 

the defendants’ expert witness, is a senior consultant in medical oncology and 

the head of the department of haematology-oncology in the National University 

Cancer Institute, Singapore and director of the investigational medicine unit in 

the National University Health System, Singapore. He is  a clinician scientist, 

meaning  that  beyond  patient  management,  he  also  researches  the  biology  of 

malignancy, and has published on the plaintiff’s specific cancer, ie, non-small 

cell  lung  cancer.  In  relation  to  the  cause  and  development  of  the  plaintiff’s 

cancer, for the reasons stated in this Judgment,  I prefer Prof Goh’s evidence, 

which  is  rooted  in  his  qualifications  and  experience.  Conversely,  Dr  Breen 

admitted that he does not practice oncology. Although he leads a tumour board, 

which makes collective decisions about the management of a patient’s cancer, 

such  boards  have  multidisciplinary  representation  precisely  because  each 

member  lacks  intimate  knowledge  of  areas  outside  his  specialty.  Dr  Breen’s 

experience  is  therefore  of  limited  utility  when  considering  the  cause  and 

prognosis of the plaintiff’s cancer. 

24 

As stated above, the plaintiff was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012, 

and  the  ALK-positive  status  discovered  in  2014.  Prof  Goh,  the  Hospital’s 

expert, explained that the plaintiff’s ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer 

developed  from  the  rare  fusion  of  two  genes,  namely  the  ALK  gene  and  the 

EML4 gene, resulting in the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Medical knowledge of 

such a gene fusion only began to be acquired around 2007. It is not known what 

causes  this  gene  fusion  to  occur.  The  ALK  gene  encodes  a  receptor  (able  to 

receive chemical signals from outside a cell) called tyrosine kinase, and upon 

 

11
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
activation by two of these receptors binding to each other, it can stimulate cell 

[2018] SGHC 35 

proliferation (ie, an increase in the number of cells). The ALK gene is usually 

not expressed in human tissues but with the abovementioned fusion, the gene is 

expressed on the cell membrane and is continually activated. This means it can 

continually  send  growth  signals  to  the  nucleus  of  the  cells,  and  more 

importantly, it is oncogenic (ie, having the potential to cause cancer) and can 

transform what was initially benign cells into malignant (ie, cancerous) cells. 

Dr Daniel Tan agreed with this description. Notably, Prof Goh also stated that 

EML4-ALK fusion gene cannot exist in benign cells and thus the presence of 

the fusion gene means that there is cancer.   

25 

According to Prof Goh, the ALK-positive lung cancer is aggressive in 

nature. However, the plaintiff’s  nodule was stable and indolent  from  2007 to 

2011,  which  is  inconsistent  with  the  behaviour  of  an  ALK-positive  cancer. 

Thus,  Prof  Goh  opined  that  the  plaintiff’s  nodule  was  likely  to  be  initially 

benign scar tissue, but acquired the ALK gene fusion at some point in 2011 to 

2012,  resulting  in  a  malignancy.  Importantly,  the  juxtaposition  of  the  slow 

growth of the nodule between 2007 and 2011 against the aggressive spread of 

the disease in 2012 and 2014 (which was when the plaintiff’s cancer recurred 

after the lobectomy) leads to the conclusion that the nodule was not malignant 

from  2007  to  2011.  If  the  nodule  was  malignant  in  2007,  he  would  have 

expected it to grow a lot faster than it did between 2007 and 2011. This means 

that when the plaintiff consulted the respective defendant-doctors, her nodule 

was benign. 

26 

The plaintiff contends that she may already have had a different form of 

slow-growing lung cancer before the gene fusion occurred. This stemmed from 

Dr Breen’s suggestion that mutations could occur at any stage within a cancer. 

 

12
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
Alternatively,  the  plaintiff  argues  that  the  gene  fusion  (and  thus  her  cancer) 

[2018] SGHC 35 

occurred before July 2011 but was simply slow-growing, thus the indolence of 

the  nodule.  Dr  Breen  stated  that  some  ALK-positive  lung  cancers  were  not 

aggressive in nature, which Prof Goh agreed with.  Dr Daniel Tan also testified 

that he would not conclude that the ALK-positive lung cancers were aggressive 

because these  cancers were usually diagnosed as ALK-positive only  at  Stage 

IV, and knowledge of the history of the ALK-positive disease was limited. In 

relation  to  the  plaintiff’s  cancer,  Dr  Daniel  Tan  stated  that  he  would  not 

conclude  that  the  relapse  of  the  plaintiff’s  cancer  could  be  considered 

aggressive. The plaintiff’s chance of relapse was assessed to be 50% within five 

years, and her relapse after two years four months did not go one way or the 

other  towards  assessing  her  cancer’s  aggressiveness.  Dr  Daniel  Tan  was  the 

plaintiff’s  treating  oncologist  called  as  a  witness  of  fact  to  testify  on  her 

treatment and future medical care. His past experience with ALK-positive lung 

cancer concerned patients with Stage IV cancer. Hence, he could not comment 

on the aggressiveness of the cancer based on the timing of plaintiff’s relapse.  

The court’s finding 

27 

The plaintiff does not have any definitive medical evidence showing that 

she had cancer from 2007 to 2011. Dr Breen acknowledged as much – when 

asked whether he had any view regarding when the nodule became cancerous, 

he stated that “[it] is impossible to state at any stage which of these lesions was 

a cancerous lesion. All we know is that there was a nodule there”. He stated that 

“[we] cannot state what the pathology was because we didn’t have the pathology 

at the beginning”. Thus, the court’s finding has to be based on other evidence 

pointing to the nodule’s benignity or malignancy from 2007 to 2011, such as 

the nodule’s growth and its features as reflected in the X-rays. The radiological 

 

13
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
evidence  does  not  show  whether  the  nodule  is  malignant  or  benign;  what  it 

[2018] SGHC 35 

shows is the size, shape and growth of the nodule, and the expert evidence was 

adduced towards interpreting the significance of these features. 

28 

I have considered that the case is slightly more difficult in relation to Dr 

Soh’s consultation in July 2011. By November 2011 the plaintiff already had 

blood in her sputum and was referred to A/Prof Sridhar. The short timeframe of 

months between Dr Soh’s consultation and the plaintiff’s visit to Dr Wong and 

A/Prof Sridhar makes it possible to argue that malignancy had already occurred 

by  July  2011.  Plainly,  the  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  proving  that  she  had 

cancer at all the material times. In my view, the plaintiff has not established on 

a balance of probabilities that she already had cancer in July 2011. With Prof 

Goh’s opinion on the cause of her cancer in mind, which I will come to, there 

was little evidence to indicate in July 2011 that the gene fusion had occurred 

and the nodule in her right lung had turned malignant. Even when the plaintiff 

saw A/Prof Sridhar, he still treated her conservatively initially and the CT scan 

performed  in  December  2011  showed  features  that  were  reported  by  the 

radiologist  to  be  benign.  I  thus  find  that  she  cannot  prove  on  the  balance  of 

probabilities that she already had cancer in July 2011 when she consulted with 

Dr Soh.  

29 

In my view, the defendants are able to show on a balance of probabilities 

based on Prof Goh’s opinion that the plaintiff’s nodule was initially benign. This 

opinion  is  further  supported  by  the  other  medical  evidence  on  the  nodule’s 

stability and the lack of features indicating malignancy.  I will go through the 

radiological evidence in some detail. The Hospital called Dr Lynette Teo (“Dr 

Teo”)  as  an  expert  witness.  Dr  Teo  is  a  senior  consultant  in  the  National 

University Cancer Institute, Singapore, and Department of Diagnostic Imaging, 

 

14
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
National  University  of  Singapore.  She  has  about  11  years  of  experience  as  a 

[2018] SGHC 35 

specialist in radiology.  

30 

Four X-rays were taken of the plaintiff from 2007 to 2011. The first is 

the October 2007 X-ray, which was ordered by Dr Yeo in the A&E Department, 

and was the first time the plaintiff’s nodule was noticed as an incidental finding. 

All  four  X-rays  were  eventually  reported,  and  the  nodule  measured,  by  the 

Hospital’s  radiologists,  but  the  October  and  November  2007  X-rays  were 

retrospectively reported in 2012. This means that in 2007, radiological reports 

of the X-ray were not prepared and thus unavailable. The plaintiff’s witness, Dr 

Tan, and the defendants’ expert, Dr Teo, also measured the nodule in these X-

rays. Their measurements were:

In  relation  to  the  method  and  accuracy  of  measurements,  Dr  Teo 

explained (and this was not disputed by Dr Breen) that there is inter- and intra-

observer  variability  in  a  nodule’s  measurement.  This  means  that  two 

radiologists may reasonably take different measurements of  the same nodule, 

and  one  radiologist  may  take  different  measurements  of  the  same  nodule  at 

 

15
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
different  times.  Hence,  to  determine  a  nodule’s  development  in  size,  the 

[2018] SGHC 35 

measurements  taken  by  one  person  in  one  sitting  are  most  accurate. 

Measurements taken of nodules could vary up to 10-20%. Smaller nodules have 

a higher margin of tolerance. As a result, the measurements of the nodule by the 

radiologists who reported the X-rays, Dr Tan, and Dr Teo differed as between 

each other by around 2-3mm. Dr Tan and Dr Teo’s set of measurements for the 

four X-rays showed slight increases in the size of the nodule from October 2007 

to July 2011.  

32 

This is an appropriate juncture to consider the plaintiff’s case that the 

nodule  measured  2.2cm  as  early  as  15  November  2007.  Compared  with  the 

measurements on 31 October 2007, this would have meant a doubling time of 

merely  nine  days.  Mr  Rai,  the  plaintiff’s  counsel,  bases  this  on  Dr  Rameysh 

Danovani bin Mahmood (“Dr Rameysh”)’s April 2010 X-ray report, wherein 

Dr Rameysh noted “[a] rounded opacity measuring approximately 2.2cm is seen 

in the (R) mid zone, which appears stable since the previous chest radiograph 

dated  15/11/2007”.  The  issue  to  be  determined  is  not  what  Dr  Rameysh 

perceived the nodule size to be on 29 April 2010, but its actual size as recorded 

on the reports. In this regard, several witnesses have come forth to give evidence 

that the nodule grew in  an indolent  way. More importantly, Dr Rameysh has 

since relooked at the Dicom images of the X-rays in the course of preparing his 

Affidavit  of  Evidence-in-Chief  and  concluded  that  the  nodule  measured 

approximately  1.5cm  on  15  November  2007  and  approximately  1.9cm  on  29 

April 2010. The inference that the plaintiff drew from Dr Rameysh’s radiology 

report was therefore untenable. 

33 

The radiological evidence shows that the nodule was stable, indicating 

its benignity, from the period of 2007 to 2011. First, the slow rate of growth of 

 

16
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
the  nodule  was  consistent  with  its  benignity.  I  accept  Dr  Rameysh,  Dr  Teo, 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Associate  Professor  Malcolm  Mahadevan  (“A/Prof  Mahadevan”), 

the 

defendant-doctors’ emergency medicine expert, and Prof Goh’s evidence that a 

nodule which has slightly or marginally increased in size and/or did not display 

any clinically significant growth would be regarded as stable, in contrast to Dr 

Breen, the only witness who implied that a nodule could only be stable if it did 

not change at all or if there is calcification in the nodule. Although the witnesses 

provided slightly different opinions on what substantial or otherwise clinically 

significant  growth  would  entail,  this  is  largely  a  professional  judgment  to  be 

made by the radiologist or doctor when considering the nodule.  Further, Prof 

Goh explained that it was not just the growth of the nodule that was significant, 

but its rate of growth, as benign lesions could grow as well. Thus, even on Dr 

Tan’s measurements (1.5cm in 2007 to 1.9cm in 2010), the increase in size over 

this period would not be considered significant. Based on her measurements, Dr 

Teo opined that the rate of growth of the nodule was consistent with the nodule 

being stable. The April 2010 X-ray report by Dr Rameysh and the July 2011 X-

ray report by Dr Khoo Teng Kew and Dr Mohammad Taufik also stated that the 

nodule  “[appeared]  stable”  and  was  “largely  stable”  respectively.  A/Prof 

Mahadevan  also  opined  that  the  nodule’s  rate  of  growth  was  not  clinically 

significant. Given the consistent evidence, I accept that the nodule would have 

been considered stable, and I so find.  

34 

The plaintiff, through Dr Breen, argues that there are slow-growing lung 

cancers  and  the  nodule’s  slow  growth  does  not  lead  to  a  conclusion  that  the 

nodule  was  benign  or  malignant.  However,  all  parties  now  know  that  the 

plaintiff has ALK-positive lung cancer. Prof Goh explained that this cancer is 

generally  aggressive,  and  the  behaviour  of  the  plaintiff’s  cancer  in  2012  and 

 

17
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
2014 in fact reflected this aggressiveness. Thus it is unlikely that the nodule’s 

[2018] SGHC 35 

indolence was a result of slow-growing cancer. 

35 

Second,  the  long  doubling  time  of  the  nodule  (ie,  the  time  taken  to 

double in size) was also another indicator of its stability and benignity. Dr Teo 

gave  evidence  that  the  doubling  time,  by  her  calculations,  was  1290  days,  in 

contrast to the usual doubling time of a malignant nodule, which was around 30 

to 500 days. The parties also relied on other medical literature that placed the 

median  volume  doubling  time  of  a  malignant  nodule  at  98  (the  Henscheke 

paper) and 149 (the Hasegawa paper). Regardless, by any measure, according 

to Dr Teo, the nodule would still be considered “extremely slow growing” and 

thus unlikely to be malignant. The plaintiff relies on Prof Goh’s testimony that 

a doubling in size of the nodule in three years would be considered substantial 

growth.  She  argues  that  the  nodule  had  grown  by  26%  in  diameter  between 

October 2007 and April 2011 (based on Dr Tan’s measurements, ie, from 1.5 

cm  to  1.9 cm), translating to  a doubling in  volume of the nodule, which was 

substantial. However, this assumes that the nodule was spherical in shape, and 

there was no evidence to suggest so. Dr Teo had in fact stated that the nodule 

was ovoid. Prof Goh also clarified he meant “doubling” of the diameter rather 

than the volume, although he later acknowledged that Dr Teo was referring to 

the volume doubling time of a nodule, determined by keying in an average of 

the  length  and  width  of  the  nodule  measured  into  an  online  calculator,  and 

agreed with her opinion on that basis, ie, that the volume doubling time of the 

nodule was far longer than what would be expected from a malignant nodule.  

36 

Third,  between  2007  and  2011,  there  were  no  noted  features  of  the 

nodule  indicating  malignancy.  The  nodule  was  described  as  “non-specific 

and… indeterminate in nature” in the April 2010 X-ray report, “non-specific in 

 

18
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
nature” in the July 2011 X-ray report, and “round”/“rounded” in the November 

[2018] SGHC 35 

2007,  April  2010  and  December  2011  X-ray  reports.  No  abnormalities 

indicating malignancy, such as spiculation (stranding at the edges), cavitation 

(with a cavity, perhaps indicating tuberculosis) or lobulation (looking like lobes, 

signalling uneven growth) were noted. 

37 

Fourth,  even  when  the  plaintiff  was  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer 

following the biopsy in February 2012, she was clinically staged at Stage I, a 

very early stage of her cancer. A  few months  before that in December 2011, 

when she underwent a CT scan, the radiologist Dr Chan still diagnosed it as a 

benign  pulmonary  hamartoma  and  A/Prof  Sridhar  similarly  thought  that  the 

plaintiff’s nodule was benign. Although Dr Chan recommended a biopsy (which 

was eventually carried out in February 2012), she recommended it for baseline 

histological  correlation  in  view  of  the  plaintiff’s  symptoms  (eg,  blood  in  her 

cough) and known history of smoking, such that there could be a comparison 

with  the  results  of  later  scans  and  investigations  (see  [11]  above)  should 

subsequent  changes  to  the  nodule  occur.  Dr  Chan  had  already  opined  on  the 

results of the CT scan. The point is that even in late 2011 and early 2012, both 

A/Prof Sridhar and Dr Chan were inclined towards the view that her nodule was 

benign.  

38 

Further, even though Dr Breen repeatedly testified that a CT scan should 

have  been  carried  out  during  all  the  defendants’  consultations  from  2007  to 

2011, he was unable to testify as to what such a CT scan would have possibly 

shown.  This  is  surprising  seeing  his  insistence  on  a  CT  scan  and  given  his 

experience  in  staging  and  diagnosing  lung  cancers  through  these  exact 

diagnostic tests. As was evident from the CT scan carried out in December 2011, 

even  at  this  late  stage,  the  plaintiff’s  nodule  was  still  reported  as  benign  and 

 

19
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
inferentially it is unlikely that any previous CT scans carried out would have 

[2018] SGHC 35 

been any different. Finally, even though the plaintiff claims that her nodule was 

malignant since 2007, when she was diagnosed four years later, she was only at 

Stage I. If she had been suffering from cancer since 2007, one would not expect 

her to still be at such an early stage of the cancer. The evidence from the CT 

scan and biopsy thus shows that it was unlikely that her nodule turned malignant 

until 2012.  

39 

Although  Prof  Goh  could  not  say  for  certain  when  the  gene  fusion 

actually occurred, he was able to opine that there was no obvious change in the 

nodule between 2007 and July 2011. Furthermore, with Prof Goh’s opinion on 

the cause of her cancer in mind, there was little evidence to indicate that in July 

2011 the gene fusion had occurred and the nodule in her right lung had already 

turned malignant. I accept Dr Breen’s evidence (which Prof Goh agreed with)  

that there are some ALK-positive lung cancers that do not behave aggressively, 

but this misses the point. Other than the fact that Dr Breen also agreed that ALK-

positive lung cancers are generally aggressive, on the evidence, the plaintiff’s 

ALK tumour was aggressive in nature, as shown by the microscopic metastasis 

in the plaintiff’s lymph nodes in 2012 and its extensive spread during the 2014 

relapse. The plaintiff’s response to the ALK inhibitor during the clinical  trial 

was also shorter than the average patient. The nub of Prof Goh’s evidence was 

not simply that the plaintiff’s tumour was aggressive but that there was a marked 

change in  the behaviour of the nodule  and the development  of the plaintiff’s 

condition  over  the  various  time  points.  The  nodule’s  growth  (in  millimetres) 

was indolent and stable between 2007 and July 2011 (see [33] above), but was 

aggressive  in  and  after  2012.  This  thus  indicates  “an  obvious  change  in  the 

character of this lesion”. The discordance between the nodule’s growth in the 

two periods lends credence to Prof Goh’s opinion, which I accept. I also note 

 

20
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
that the plaintiff did not dispute Dr Chan’s diagnosis of the plaintiff’s nodule as 

[2018] SGHC 35 

benign, a pulmonary harmatoma, during the CT scan in December 2011, and no 

expert had offered a different diagnosis of the CT scan. In view of this, and for 

all the reasons above, I find that the nodule was initially benign in nature but 

later became malignant in the period after July 2011 to early February 2012. 

40 

For completeness, Dr Breen also stated that certain lung cancers can be 

slow growing, as “adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma 

can be a very prolonged period or stability”, and thus he “[did] not believe that 

the original apparent nodule was not an early stage cancer which subsequently 

changed in growth pattern in subsequent years”. However, this clearly did not 

apply in the plaintiff’s case. An adenocarcinoma in situ is also known as Stage 

0 of a cancer, and is reflected in a nodule with ground glass appearance. Prof 

Goh and Dr Teo’s evidence is that a cancer at Stage 0 (or an adenocarcinoma in 

situ) could not have been detected on an X-ray. This was because such Stage 0 

nodules would be ground glass opacities which  were not  dense enough to be 

seen on an X-ray. It was not disputed that the plaintiff’s nodule was visible on 

her first X-ray taken in October 2007. Thus, the plaintiff could not have had an 

adenocarcinoma in situ from 2007 to 2011. When cross-examined by Ms Kuah, 

Dr Breen also agreed that he was not suggesting that the plaintiff’s nodule was 

an adenocarcinoma in situ or a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. 

41 

In relation to the plaintiff’s contention that she had a different form of 

lung  cancer  before  the  gene  fusion  occurred,  this  was  not  supported  by  the 

evidence. Dr Breen had only offered it as a postulation and when asked whether 

he  was  putting  forth  the  evidence  that  the  plaintiff’s  cancer  was  plain 

adenocarcinoma  before  transforming  into  ALK-positive  cancer,  he  simply 

replied that he “[could not] state what it was at the outset”. Without any other 

 

21
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
medical evidence, the plaintiff cannot prove that this was what had happened. 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Conversely,  Prof  Goh  testified  that  it  was  unlikely  that  the  plaintiff’s  nodule 

commenced  as  a  non-ALK-positive  lung  cancer  before  developing  into  an 

ALK-positive lung cancer. He referred to the plaintiff’s good response to ALK-

inhibitors as evidence that her malignancy was driven by a single gene fusion 

instead of some other molecular driver.  

42 

For  the  reasons  stated,  the  plaintiff  cannot  prove  that  she  already  had 

cancer in July 2011 during her consultation with Dr Soh. I accept and find that 

the defendants have, on a balance of probabilities, established that the plaintiff 

did  not  have  cancer  during  the  individual  consultations  with  the  defendant-

doctors. This  conclusion means that  causation and loss  cannot  be established 

and the plaintiff’s case in negligence against the defendants cannot succeed. As 

a  large  part  of  the  complaints  against  the  defendants  is  in  relation  to  the 

management of the plaintiff in not investigating the nodule or referring her to a 

specialist, I will now turn to comment on the evidence led as to the staging of 

the  plaintiff’s  cancer  and  her  eventual  management.  This  goes  back  to  the 

plaintiff’s assertion that early detection would have meant less severe treatment.  

Treatment of lung cancer from 2012 

43 

The  medical  evidence  shows  that  the  plaintiff  was  diagnosed  at  the 

earliest possible stage of her cancer and received the full treatment available to 

her. She did not lose out on any opportunity to take advantage of any available 

treatments and did not undergo any treatment that could have been avoided. The 

plaintiff was clinically staged as Stage I by A/Prof Sridhar in March 2012 (see 

[11] above), which was the earliest possible clinical staging. As stated above at 

[40], a Stage 0 cancer would not have been detected on an X-ray as the nodule 

would have a ground glass appearance and would not be visible on an X-ray. 

 

22
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
The  most  appropriate  treatment  for  early  stage  cancers  (it  was  in  fact  only 

[2018] SGHC 35 

available for early stage cancers) was a lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, 

which the plaintiff underwent. The plaintiff herself accepted that her lobectomy 

would  have  been  unavoidable.  The  adjuvant  chemotherapy  was  also  an 

unavoidable treatment,  as  it is  usually  administered after surgery to  eradicate 

any microscopic traces of cancer which cannot be spotted and reduce the risk of 

relapse. Dr Daniel Tan testified that the plaintiff’s chemotherapy (including its 

extent, ie, four cycles of vinorelbine-cisplatin) was the standard treatment for 

early stage cancers. 

44 

Although the plaintiff was later pathologically staged as Stage IIA, such 

staging,  even  though  more  accurate,  was  only  possible  after  the  tumour  had 

been  surgically  resected.  This  means  that  any  clinical  decision  made  on  her 

course of treatment would  have  always been based on  her  clinical  staging of 

Stage  I.  Regardless,  Dr  Breen,  A/Prof  Koong  (who  advised  the  plaintiff  to 

undergo surgery) and Prof Goh all agreed that even assuming that it was known 

before surgery that the plaintiff would have been pathologically staged at Stage 

I,  the  appropriate  course  of  treatment  for  her  of  a  lobectomy  and  adjuvant 

chemotherapy,  being  the  most  appropriate  for  early  stage  cancers,  would  not 

have been any different. Dr Daniel Tan also explained that the plaintiff’s staging 

was at the borderline of Stage I and Stage IIA as far as the size of the tumour 

was concerned. 

45 

The  genetic  make-up  of  the  plaintiff’s  cancer  also  had  certain 

implications in terms of its diagnosis and treatability. The ALK fusion gene was 

discovered  in  2007,  and  even  in  2009,  the  medical  community  was  still 

beginning  to  understand  whether  this  gene  fusion  had  any  therapeutic  and 

oncogenic  implications.  It  was  also  only  in  2009  that  proof  of  concept 

 

23
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
completely established that an ALK inhibitor was the appropriate response. Dr 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Daniel Tan testified that it was only in 2014 that testing for the gene became 

more established and more commonly performed for newly diagnosed Stage IV 

lung  cancer.  In  2012,  although  a  test  was  carried  out  for  an  EGFR  mutation 

(which was more commonly known) for the plaintiff, the testing for the ALK 

fusion gene, being a relatively new molecular entity, was not initiated then. It 

was only in 2014, when the plaintiff’s cancer relapsed, that he tested for ALK. 

46 

Crucially, ALK inhibitors were only shown to have utility in or around 

2011,  and  the  first  drugs  approved  for  the  treatment  of  ALK-positive  cancer 

were only available for Singapore clinical trials in 2013 or 2014. Even then, this 

was only for patients suffering late stage (Stage IV) cancer. This was why Dr 

Daniel  Tan  only  initiated  ALK  testing  after  the  plaintiff’s  relapse,  as  ALK 

inhibitors were unavailable in 2012 and thus the finding would have made no 

difference to the management of the plaintiff’s cancer. Prof Goh agreed with Dr 

Daniel  Tan’s  assessment.  This  meant  that  the  plaintiff  had  also  received  the 

treatment of ALK inhibitors for her cancer at the earliest available time. 

47 

In terms of her chances of survival, as the plaintiff was diagnosed at an 

early stage of her cancer (Stage IIA), she had, at the time of her diagnosis in 

2012,  a  more  than  even  chance  of  five-year  survival.  Prof  Goh  produced 

statistics from a study of non-small cell lung cancer patients who had undergone 

adjuvant  chemotherapy  after  full  resection  of  their  tumour.  This  study  found 

that there was a 61-62% five-year survival rate for Stage IIA patients. Dr Daniel 

Tan,  who  was  a  factual  witness,  produced  statistics  from  the  International 

Association  for  the  Study  of  Lung  Cancer  that  the  five-year  survival  rate  for 

Stage IIA lung cancer was 52%, although these statistics were far more general. 

Although she may have had a slightly higher statistical possibility of survival if 

 

24
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
she were treated at Stage I (around 72-73%), it is difficult to know, certainly not 

[2018] SGHC 35 

on the balance of probabilities, whether this would have made a difference to 

the  progression  of  her  cancer,  which  Prof  Goh  consistently  testified  was 

aggressive in nature. I also note that the plaintiff’s claim for damages is not for 

her shortened life expectancy, but for the cost of her drugs for the next ten years. 

Her claim is thus framed in the expectation that she will survive for the next ten 

years, as opposed to a shortened life expectancy. 

48 

The foregoing shows that the plaintiff was able to and did receive the 

full treatment possible for her lung cancer since her diagnosis in 2012. The type 

and extent of her treatment was unfortunately unavoidable in any circumstance, 

and was in fact the best and most appropriate treatment she could have received. 

Duty and Breach 

49 

Having found that the plaintiff did not have cancer at the material times, 

and that her treatment would have remained the same, the plaintiff’s claim in 

negligence  cannot  succeed  without  proving  causation.  However,  I  will 

nevertheless evaluate the defendants’ management of the plaintiff and comment 

on  whether  it  met  the  applicable  standard  of  care.  Regardless  of  whether  the 

nodule  was  ultimately  malignant  or  not,  the  presence  of  the  nodule  in  the 

plaintiff’s  lung  was  an  abnormality.  A  doctor  exercising  reasonable  care  and 

skill would have still needed to make a clinical decision as to how to manage 

the  plaintiff’s  nodule.  In  this  case,  the  plaintiff  had  no  symptoms  that  were 

related to the nodule to  place her at risk of cancer.  Yet her assertions require 

pre-symptomatic detection and treatment of a young person under 35 years of 

age,  with  no  symptoms  of  lung  cancer,  and  had  declared  herself  as  a  non-

smoker.  I  will examine the defendant-doctors’ alleged breaches in  relation  to 

 

25
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
their  individual  consultations  with  the  plaintiff  in  light  of  her  assertions.  In 

[2018] SGHC 35 

contrast, her presenting symptoms were of a different origin and the defendant-

doctors evidence-based assessment and management of the nodule was from the 

view point of a low index of suspicion for malignancy on the occasions each of 

the defendant-doctors saw the plaintiff.   

A doctor’s duty and standard of care 

50 

It  is  well-established  that  doctors  owe  duties  to  their  patients  to  take 

reasonable  care  in  the  diagnosis,  treatment  and  advice  rendered  to  patients. 

Hospitals similarly owe duties of care to their patients. The defendants do not 

dispute that they owed a duty of care towards the plaintiff. I thus move on to 

determine if the defendants’ duties to the plaintiffs were breached. The standard 

of care applicable to doctors was recently canvassed in Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng 

Jin London Lucien [2017] SGCA 38 (“Hii Chii Kok”).  

51 

In  relation  to  diagnosis  and  treatment,  the  test  in  Bolam  v  Friern 

Hospital  Management  Committee  [1957]  1  WLR  582  (“Bolam  test”)  applies 

together  with  the  addendum  in  Bolitho  v  City  and  Hackney  Health  Authority 

[1998] AC 232 (“Bolitho addendum”). In determining whether the professional 

standard has been met, the court has to consider (Hii Chii Kok at [76]): 

(a)  Whether the defendant’s practice is supported by a responsible 

body of medical opinion within the profession, even if there is another 

body of opinion which disagrees; 

(b)  Whether  the  expert(s)  holding  the  opinion  had  directed  their 

minds to the comparative risks and benefits relating to the matter; 

 

26
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 

[2018] SGHC 35 

(c)  Whether  the  opinion  was  defensible,  ie,  it  was  internally 

consistent and did not contradict relevant extrinsic facts. 

52 

It is not disputed by the parties that the applicable standard of care for 

the plaintiff’s allegations for diagnosis and treatment is the Bolam test with the 

Bolitho  addendum,  although  the  plaintiff’s  claim  is  largely  one  of  missed 

diagnosis  as  opposed  to  negligent  treatment.  Her  claim  is  not  quite  that  the 

defendants were negligent when providing her with treatment (here, either no 

treatment or painkillers for her presenting complaints) but that they did not treat 

her  for  cancer.  Such  an  approach  to  treatment  stems  from  the  defendants’ 

diagnosis that she had no cancer and that her pain was of a different origin.  

53 

In relation to advice, the Court of Appeal in Hii Chii Kok acknowledged 

that a doctor’s duty in relation to patient advice was different from his duty in 

diagnosis  and  treatment.  A  three-stage  test  was  to  be  applied,  evaluating  (a) 

whether  the  information  withheld  was  relevant  or  material;  (b)  whether  the 

doctors  possessed  such  information  at  the  relevant  time;  and  (c)  whether  the 

doctors were reasonably justified in withholding such information (at [184]). 

54 

The next question is whether the advice aspect, and thus the three-stage 

test in the preceding paragraph, is applicable here. In Hii Chii Kok, the Court of 

Appeal acknowledged that the aspects of diagnosis, treatment, and advice often 

emerge and submerge at various points in a doctor-patient relationship, but that 

the  essential  feature  of  the  aspect  of  advice  is  the  active  role  played  by  the 

patient in the decision-making process (at [93]). The patient needs to have all 

the relevant and material information to make the most appropriate decision for 

herself in relation to her treatment or risky and/or invasive diagnostic processes 

(at [96]-[98]). Conversely, when a patient is being diagnosed and treated, her 

 

27
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
role is largely passive. The defendants argue that the only applicable standard 

[2018] SGHC 35 

of care here is the Bolam test with the Bolitho addendum (as specified in [51] 

above), as the true nature of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants is in 

relation to diagnosis and treatment and not advice. The plaintiff argues that the 

advice aspect is engaged in the sense that the defendants failed to advise her of 

her “not insignificant” risk of cancer (although I note that her pleaded case does 

not contain an express reference to this), the results of any X-rays, or to go for 

further investigations or at least that other diagnostic options existed.  

55 

In  my  view,  the  plaintiff’s  claims  fall  squarely  within  the  realm  of 

diagnosis and treatment. She was in a position of passivity from the time she 

started consulting the defendants to when she was not given a specific treatment 

or treated with painkillers. The defendants did not advise the plaintiff of the risk 

of cancer because they, based on their diagnosis, did not consider that cancer 

was the likely cause of the plaintiff’s presenting complaints, and therefore did 

not think that the nodule presented a risk of cancer. Their interpretations of the 

X-rays and the corresponding decision not to undertake more diagnostic tests 

was a result of their diagnosis that the plaintiff’s nodule was benign or that her 

pain was simply musculoskeletal in nature, and that the nodule was an incidental 

finding  unrelated  to  her  presenting  complaints.  If  they  considered  that  the 

plaintiff’s condition, based on their diagnosis, did not warrant taking more tests 

or referral to other doctors, and if they were wrong in considering that it was 

not  warranted, this  was a problem in  their diagnosis and  should be evaluated 

based on the Bolam test. To the extent that they should minimally have told the 

plaintiff that she had a nodule or opacity in her right lung, my view is that this 

should  still  be  considered  part  of  diagnosis,  as  this  is  part  of  their 

communication  of  their  diagnosis  to  the  patient,  rather  than  advising  her  on 

different  treatments  or  diagnostic  procedures.  However,  as  will  be  evident,  I 

 

28
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
find that the doctors who had noticed the nodule (Dr Imran and Dr Yap) had 

[2018] SGHC 35 

communicated this to the plaintiff, and for the doctor who had not (Dr Soh), he 

simply  did  not  have  such  information,  and  the  correct  approach  would  be  to 

analyse if he was negligent in not having such information (ie, in not noticing 

the nodule). One cannot give what he does not have (Hii Chii Kok at [133]). 

56 

Finally, in determining the question of breach, I also highlight the Court 

of  Appeal’s  observation  that  there  is  a  danger  of  hindsight  bias  in  medical 

negligence cases, on the part of medical experts, lawyers, and judges (Hii Chii 

Kok  at  [157]-[159]).  Thus,  when  evaluating  whether  the  doctor  has  met  the 

requisite standard of care in any aspect of his interaction with his patient, the 

court should apply the tests with reference only to the facts known at the time 

that the material event occurred.  

Breach of duty 

57 

I  now  examine  the  defendants’  alleged  breaches  in  relation  to  the 

plaintiff’s  diagnosis  and  treatment.  As  stated  above  (at  [55]),  the  aspect  of 

advice  does  not  come  into  play.  As  the  plaintiff’s  claims  against  the  first 

defendant,  the  Hospital,  are  mainly  based  on  the  breaches  by  its  individual 

doctors, ie, the second to fourth defendants, I will deal with the second to fourth 

defendants before evaluating the plaintiff’s case against the Hospital. 

Dr Imran 

58 

Dr Imran, the second defendant, was the respiratory specialist working 

in  the  Hospital.  He  saw  patients  in  the  Hospital’s  specialist  outpatient  clinic. 

The  plaintiff  saw  Dr  Imran  in  November  2007  following  a  referral  from  the 

Hospital’s A&E department (see [7]-[8] above). Dr Imran consulted the A&E 

 

29
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
records  and  noted  that  the  plaintiff  had  complained  of  centralised  chest 

[2018] SGHC 35 

discomfort, nausea and mild breathlessness. She was diagnosed by Dr Yeo in 

the A&E department as having “possible gastritis / [Gastroesophageal Reflux 

Disease]”.  The  A&E  record  also  noted  that  she  was  a  non-smoker.  Dr  Yeo 

ordered the October 2007 X-ray and noted that there was an incidental finding 

of opacity in the mid-zone of the plaintiff’s right lung, thus referring her to Dr 

Imran. During the consultation, Dr Imran went through the A&E records with 

the plaintiff and conducted a physical examination. This is corroborated by Dr 

Imran’s medical notes, where he recorded that the plaintiff saw A&E for chest 

pain, had no respiratory symptoms otherwise (no cough, no blood, no sputum), 

no weight loss, no loss of appetite, and that her lung was clear.  

59 

Dr Imran reviewed the October 2007 X-ray, noted a rounded opacity in 

the right mid zone, and ordered the repeat November 2007 X-ray in two views, 

an erect view and lateral view. He then studied the November 2007 X-ray on 

wet  film  on  a  light  box.  In  the  erect  view  he  did  not  spot  the  opacity.  On 

hindsight he testified that the opacity was “completely hidden by the rib”. In the 

right  lateral  view  he  also  testified  that  he  could  not  see  any  “corresponding 

opacity”.  The plaintiff claims that Dr Imran had seen the obvious opacity in the 

erect view of the November 2007 X-ray when consulting with the plaintiff. The 

fact that Dr Imran was, during the trial and with the benefit of hindsight, able to 

point out the opacity in the erect view cannot be taken to mean that he had seen 

it in November 2007. I accept Dr Imran’s evidence that he looked at both views 

of the November 2007 X-ray together and, on the basis of both, either did not 

see the opacity or saw a very faint version of it as compared to the October 2007 

X-ray. This was consistent with his contemporaneous notes and treatment plan 

for the plaintiff. He recorded in his handwritten notes that the “opacity [seemed] 

clear”.  The  plaintiff  contended  that  the  phrase  instead  read  “opacity  for 

 

30
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
investigation”, but I accept Dr Imran’s evidence since (a) this was Dr Imran’s 

[2018] SGHC 35 

handwriting  and  there  was  no  reason  to  prefer  the  plaintiff’s  personal 

interpretation; (b) it was consistent with the line above it, which read “[Chest 

X-ray]  No lung lesion”, which the plaintiff did not challenge; and (c) it was 

consonant  with  Dr  Imran’s  eventual  conclusion  to  give  the  plaintiff  an  open 

date. The plaintiff has not pursued this argument in closing submissions.  

60 

On that basis, Dr Imran concluded that there was no obvious nodule, that 

the opacity appeared to be resolving or resolved, and was likely to be infective 

or  inflammatory  in  nature.  Given  that  the  plaintiff  was  asymptomatic  in 

November 2007, Dr Imran gave her an open date for follow up and advised her 

to return for a review if she felt unwell or had any new symptoms. The plaintiff 

agreed that she understood this to mean that she could call the outpatient clinic 

if she were unwell or in pain.  He did  not  request  that the X-rays be reported 

(there was no routine reporting at the Hospital then). 

61 

In summary, during Dr Imran’s consultation with the plaintiff: 

(a) 

Dr Imran diagnosed the plaintiff by going through her medical 

records  with  the plaintiff, physically  examining her, and ordering  and 

reviewing  the  November  2007  X-ray  in  two  views  together  with  the 

October 2007 X-ray. He concluded that there was no obvious nodule in 

the  plaintiff’s  right  lung,  that  the  plaintiff’s  opacity  appeared  to  be 

resolving or resolved on its own, and that it was likely to be infective or 

inflammatory in nature. 

(b) 

Dr  Imran  did  not  administer  any  treatment  to  the  plaintiff.  He 

only gave her an open date for follow-up and advised her to return for a 

review if she felt unwell or any pain. 

 

31
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
62 

I now come to whether Dr Imran had met the applicable standard of care. 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Although I have mentioned that the applicable test is the  Bolam test with the 

Bolitho addendum (see [51] above), the Hospital and Dr Imran did not call any 

expert  in  respiratory  medicine  to  support  Dr  Imran’s  management  of  the 

plaintiff. Hence, Dr Imran cannot simply claim that he acted in accordance with 

a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in 

that  particular  art:  see  Bolam  at  587.  He  thus  has  to  prove,  on  the  usual 

negligence principles, that he has met the general professional standard of care, 

ie, he has done what an ordinary skilled member of his speciality, respiratory 

medicine, would reasonably have done in his shoes: Hii Chii Kok at [57].  

63 

 Dr  Breen’s  position  essentially  was  that  there  was  an  opacity  in  the 

plaintiff’s  lung  and  should  have  been  followed  up  with  a  CT  scan  or  further 

investigations, and even if it had been assessed to be resolving, Dr Imran should 

have  called  the  plaintiff  back  for  a  follow-up  to  ensure  that  the  opacity  had 

completely  resolved.  I  will  evaluate  this  later,  but  note  that  there  are  three 

limitations to Dr Breen’s expert opinion. First, as mentioned above (at [23]), the 

patients that Dr Breen sees are all already suspected of having lung cancer with 

obvious  symptoms.  This  means  that  he  has  greater  reason  to  carry  out  more 

thorough investigations, as opposed to a respiratory physician simply seeing a 

patient from a referral from A&E without any notable suspicion of lung cancer. 

Second, Dr Breen has little knowledge of the common causes of lung opacities 

or symptoms mimicking lung cancer in Singapore, such as tuberculosis. When 

asked, he simply  stated that  “anything can mimic the features of lung cancer 

including  tuberculosis”.  Third,  he  was  generally  unaware  of  the  healthcare 

practice in Singapore. He admitted to never training or visiting professionally 

in  Singapore,  having  no  degree  of  familiarity  with  the  Singapore  healthcare 

system,  and  being  unaware  of  the  clinical  pathway  here.  His  evidence  in  the 

 

32
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
context  of  a lung  specialist  screening  for  malignancy  at  a  specialised  tertiary 

[2018] SGHC 35 

centre as to what Dr Imran should or should not have done in the significantly 

different  position  of  a  Singapore  respiratory  physician  working  in  a  general 

hospital was therefore of limited utility. 

64 

I start with Dr Imran’s diagnosis. To determine whether a diagnosis was 

reasonable, both the approach to diagnosis (ie, the diagnostic tests ordered to 

determine the patient’s medical condition) and the doctor’s eventual diagnosis 

(ie, the medical condition the patient is suffering from) should be considered: 

see Clerk  & Lindsell on Torts  (Michael  A Jones gen ed) (Sweet  & Maxwell, 

21st Ed, 2014) (“Clerk & Lindsell”) at [10-69]. A doctor should not only decide 

what  diagnostic  tests  should  be  carried  out  but  also  reach  a  reasonable 

conclusion  from  the  results.  If  he  chooses  and  carries  out  the  appropriate 

diagnostic tests and comes to a reasonable conclusion on the results, it does not 

matter that the diagnosis eventually turns out to be wrong: Hii Chii Kok at [160]. 

65 

The plaintiff argues that Dr Imran was negligent in (a) his diagnosis in 

failing to notice the nodule in the November 2007 X-ray, thus concluding that 

the opacity was infective in nature and was resolving or had already resolved, 

and (b) his approach to diagnosis, in failing to send the November 2007 X-ray 

for reporting and/or ordering a second X-ray. In particular, the plaintiff argues 

that having made such a big deal about the fact that wet films were difficult to 

read on a light box, Dr Imran should have sent the X-rays for reporting. The 

plaintiff also claims that Dr Imran breached his duty by not asking the plaintiff 

to  return  for  a  follow-up  check  to  confirm  his  diagnosis  and  ensure  that  her 

opacity had completely resolved on its own.

Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
66 

The first question is whether it was reasonable for Dr Imran, exercising 

[2018] SGHC 35 

the ordinary care and skill of a respiratory specialist, to have missed the opacity 

or  seen  so  little  of  it,  such  as  to  conclude  that  the  opacity  was  resolving  or 

resolved. I find that it was reasonable for him to have reached the conclusion 

that the opacity was resolving based on his interpretation of the X-rays and the 

facilities available to him. This is a classic case where the court has to guard 

against hindsight bias (see [56] above). An opacity that is now known to have 

developed  into  lung  cancer  may  still  have  been  quite  reasonably  failed  to  be 

observed by a medical practitioner almost a decade ago. Two radiologists, Dr 

Teo and Dr Tan, agreed that it was difficult to see the opacity. Dr Tan testified 

that with a single X-ray, the nodule may not have been seen, but because he had 

a “sequence of events”, and made an inference that the opacity behind the rib 

was the same nodule, he was able to measure the nodule. Dr Teo also expressly 

cautioned that she had evaluated all the other X-rays from 2007 to 2011 showing 

the  nodule  and  hence  may  have  hindsight  bias.  Dr  Teo  also  supported  Dr 

Imran’s observation and testified that she would also have concluded that the 

opacity was resolving based on the comparison between the October 2007 and 

November 2007 X-rays. Less of the opacity was showing out from below the 

rib in the November 2007 X-ray (ie, it became smaller). 

67 

I  note  that  Dr  Michael  BKK  Toh  (“Dr  Toh”),  who  retrospectively 

reported  the  November  2007  X-ray  in  2012,  noted  in  his  report  a  “rounded 

homogenous density” which was “not definitely correlated in the lateral view” 

and that “further action or early intervention [was] required”. Thus, unlike Dr 

Imran,  Dr  Toh  had  noted  the  opacity  in  the  November  2007  X-ray.  Mr  Lek 

argues that Dr Toh may well have been susceptible to hindsight bias, had the 

benefit of electronic manipulation of the X-rays, or checked all of the plaintiff’s 

other  X-rays  before  making  his  report.  Without  evidence  from  Dr  Toh 

 

34
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
personally (he passed away before trial), the plaintiff correctly argues that these 

[2018] SGHC 35 

are  assertions.  Nevertheless,  Dr  Toh’s  report  is  of  limited  utility  because  the 

court lacks knowledge of his instructions and available material. Further, given 

that Dr Toh’s report was prepared after the plaintiff’s cancer was discovered, I 

accept  the  possibility  that  his  call  for  early  intervention  could  have  been 

influenced by the diagnosis. Even in the report, it was stated that the clinical 

diagnosis  given  to  him  was  “pneumonia  follow  up  film”.  This  may  have 

impacted his finding that there was “air space opacity” and that it was likely to 

be infective in nature. Thus, on balance, I prefer Dr Teo and Dr Tan’s evidence 

that the opacity would be challenging to spot without the benefit of hindsight.  

68 

Further,  I  accept  as  plausible  Dr  Imran’s  evidence  that  it  was  more 

challenging to see the opacity when evaluating wet film of the November 2007 

X-rays as Dr Imran did in 2007 (ie, after the processing of the film on a light 

box,  without  electronic  aid),  as  opposed  to  a  digital  system,  and  without  the 

benefit of a radiological report (there was no routine reporting in the Hospital 

then). Electronic manipulation of the X-ray images were not available in 2007, 

and  Dr  Imran  was  unable  to  magnify  areas  of  interest,  use  digital  aids  in 

measuring the opacity, and adjust the brightness and contrast of the images. The 

interpretation of the X-ray could hence be affected by film quality and also the 

brightness of the light box that the film is placed on.  

69 

Finally it  is  appropriate  here to  consider  a case the plaintiff relies on, 

Jacqueline  Lee  Freestone  v  Murrumbidgee  Local  Health  District  [2016] 

NSWDC  53  (“Jacqueline  Lee”),  where  a  diagnostic  radiologist  was  held 

negligent in failing to spot and report an incidental finding of a lesion in a CT 

scan. Jacqueline Lee is clearly distinguishable in that it involved a diagnostic 

radiologist who had not reported a finding that would readily have been spotted 

 

35
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
by someone in her position exercising reasonable care and skill. In this case, Dr 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Imran  was  a  respiratory  physician  and  two  radiologists  have  stated  that  the 

plaintiff’s nodule was challenging to spot without the benefit of hindsight. 

70 

The  second  question  is  whether  Dr  Imran’s  diagnosis  based  on  his 

assessment  of  the  plaintiff’s  nodule  was  reasonable.  I  find  that  it  was.  Dr 

Imran’s  diagnosis  that  the  plaintiff’s  opacity  was  likely  to  be  infective  or 

inflammatory  in nature  and was  resolving and would  resolve on its own  was 

supported  not  only  by  the  radiological  evidence  but  also  the  plaintiff’s 

symptoms and profile. As explained by Dr Teo, a doctor’s clinical assessment 

of a patient is based on not only the radiological data available, but the patient’s 

age, sex, family history, risk factors, clinical symptoms and the results of other 

investigations. Further, although a doctor is responsible for eliciting a medical 

history  from  the  patient  and  coming  to  a  diagnosis  on  his  assessment  of  the 

patient’s risk factors or clinical symptoms, a patient also bears responsibility for 

giving a complete and truthful account of her lifestyle and condition, such that 

a doctor would be able to come to an accurate conclusion.  

71 

The  plaintiff  was  young  (ie,  aged  28  in  2007),  lacked  any  other 

respiratory  symptoms,  and  had  conveyed  that  she  was  a  non-smoker  to  Dr 

Imran. She claims that Dr Imran did not ask whether she was a non-smoker, but 

I prefer Dr  Imran’s evidence that he would have confirmed her non-smoking 

status  during  the  consultation,  particularly  because  the  A&E  medical  records 

expressly stated that she was a non-smoker. Further, the plaintiff’s evidence as 

to her own smoking history has been inconsistent across the doctors she visited, 

lending little credence to her claims that she had not been asked for her smoking 

history and even if she been asked for her smoking history, she would have been 

truthful and accurate. Even in relation to the consultations beyond those with 

 

36
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
the defendants, (a) the A&E medical records in 2007 stated that she was a non-

[2018] SGHC 35 

smoker; (b) Dr Wong’s notes in 2011 stated that she had been a smoker from 

age 14 to 30, and had given up two years earlier (ie, in 2009, after 2007); (c) the 

National Cancer Centre’s notes (where she was under the care of Dr Daniel Tan) 

stated  that  she  was  a  “never-smoker”.  Three  separate  doctors  made  three 

separate records of her smoking history, all different. I find it difficult to believe 

that she would have been upfront and accurate with her smoking history when 

consulting with Dr Imran, even though her smoking history would clearly have 

been relevant to Dr Imran’s diagnosis. In any case, even if she had conveyed 

what she had subsequently said on affidavit to Dr Imran, ie, she smoked from 

the  age  of  14  to  30  and  had  smoked  about  five  cigarettes  a  day,  I  accept  Dr 

Imran’s evidence that she would still be considered very low risk.  

72 

It was thus reasonable for Dr Imran to conclude that her opacity was due 

to  a  garden  variety  infection  in  Singapore,  such  as  tuberculosis,  which  was 

resolving  on  its  own.  Dr  Breen  similarly  agreed  that  it  was  likely  that  the 

plaintiff’s  opacity  was  inflammatory  or  infectious.  Even  when  reporting  the 

December 2011 X-ray (see [10] above), Dr Yeong Kuan Yuen (the radiologist) 

opined  that  the  ill-defined  shadow  was  “likely  to  be  the  result  of  infection”. 

Thus,  (a)  the  plaintiff’s  lack  of  respiratory  symptoms;  (b)  the  resolving  or 

resolved opacity in her lung, which was smaller than 3cm (and thus considered 

unlikely to be a malignancy); (c) her young age and (d) non-smoking history (as 

ascertained  by  Dr  Imran  and  from  the  A&E  record),  were  material  pieces  of 

information which supported Dr Imran’s eventual diagnosis. 

73 

The plaintiff claims that Dr Imran should have sent the November 2007 

X-ray for reporting and/or ordered a second chest X-ray or CT scan to confirm 

his diagnosis, or at least followed up with the plaintiff. She argues that there is 

 

37
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
a “cardinal medical principle” that the malignity of a nodule has to be assumed 

[2018] SGHC 35 

until it is confirmed to be benign. In relation to whether Dr Imran should have 

ordered a CT scan, the plaintiff relies on a 2005 paper referred to by Dr Teo, 

titled “Guidelines for Management of Small Pulmonary Nodules Detected on 

CT Scans: A Statement from the Fleischner Society” (“the Fleischner paper”), 

which  mentions  a  “time-honoured”  requirement  to  follow  up  on  every 

indeterminate nodule with a CT scan for a period of two years. However, first, 

the Fleischner paper itself suggested that this requirement should be revised. It 

also stated that management decisions should not be based on nodule size alone, 

but other features of the nodule. The plaintiff’s nodule did not, in 2007, display 

any  features  indicating  malignancy  (see  [36]  above).  Second,  although  the 

Fleischner  paper  referenced  a  Mayo  Clinic  CT  Screening  Trial,  which  the 

plaintiff  relies  on  to  show  that  there  is  a  50%  likelihood  of  malignancy  for 

nodules larger than 2cm, this was based on a screening trial with patients with 

drastically different demographics (aged above 50 and smoked one pack a day 

for 20 years). Further, even the authors in the trial concluded that the value of 

CT screening was unclear. Third, a CT scan is not entirely risk-free and had (in 

2007-2010) the radiation exposure of 250-300 X-rays. Dr Breen agreed that a 

CT  thorax  scan  posed  risks  for  young  women  and  Dr  Teo  explained  that the 

thyroid and breast tissue were radio-sensitive and hence a doctor would think 

very carefully before ordering a CT scan for younger patients, especially those 

of reproductive age (such as the plaintiff). CT scans should not hence be seen 

as a matter of course for every indeterminate nodule.  The Ministry of Health 

Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  for  Cancer  Screening,  published  in  2010,  also 

stated that low-dose CT scans were not recommended to screen for lung cancer. 

Finally, even though Dr Breen insisted on the need for a CT scan, he was not 

able to describe at any point in his evidence what such a CT scan would show 

 

38
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
and whether it would have made any difference to Dr Imran’s assessment of the 

[2018] SGHC 35 

plaintiff’s condition. 

74 

The plaintiff also relies on Hucks v Cole [1993] 4 Med LR 393 (“Hucks 

v Cole”) for the proposition that when faced with a potentially lethal condition, 

a doctor should exercise caution and adopt precautionary measures, especially 

if they are inexpensive and readily available. However, the facts of Hucks v Cole 

are readily distinguishable from the present. In Hucks v Cole, a doctor was held 

to  be  negligent  for  failing  to  prescribe  penicillin  to  a  patient  suffering  from 

septic places on her skin even though he knew that they were capable of leading 

to puerperal fever. There, the pathologist’s report had signalled that a form of 

septicaemia  infection  was  present  and  the  expert  evidence  was  that  it  should 

have been treated. Here, there no evidence that the plaintiff’s nodule reflected 

an  adverse  risk  to  her  health  that  could  have  been  readily  treated  by  certain 

medication or having certain steps taken. 

75  Mr Rai also compares Dr Imran’s treatment with that of A/Prof Sridhar, 

the respiratory specialist seeing the plaintiff in 2012, who had ordered a CT scan 

and recommended the plaintiff to undergo a biopsy. However, clinical diagnosis 

is made based on all the patient’s presenting symptoms and history. The plaintiff 

consulted  with  A/Prof  Sridhar  under  different  circumstances,  in  particular 

where she had blood in her sputum and when her opacity had persisted for four 

years. She had also told A/Prof Sridhar of her smoking history. Her symptoms 

and  history,  as  presented  to  A/Prof  Sridhar,  were  thus  significantly  different 

from those presented to Dr Imran. I also note that although A/Prof Sridhar and 

Dr Chan (who reported the CT scan) recommended a biopsy, this was done in 

spite of the fact that they had assessed the nodule to be benign in nature. Thus, 

even in 2012, with worsening symptoms, the plaintiff’s  doctors did not think 

 

39
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
that the nodule in her lung was malignant. In the circumstances in 2007, I find 

[2018] SGHC 35 

that Dr Imran’s diagnosis was reasonable. Given his diagnosis, I also find that 

there was no need to send the X-ray for reporting and/or to order a second chest 

X-ray (the November 2007 X-ray was already the second in two months). 

76 

However, I find that Dr Imran breached his duty by failing to arrange 

for  a  follow-up  with  the  plaintiff  to  ensure  that  her  opacity  had  completely 

resolved.  Dr  Breen  testified  that  even  for  a  resolving  opacity,  follow-up  was 

required  to  ensure  complete  resolution,  unless  there  was  almost  complete 

resolution with a slight abnormality. In this case, Dr Imran noted that the opacity 

was  resolving  on  its  own  but  not  completely  resolved,  as  he  was  unable  to 

clearly see the opacity on both views.  Although I have found that his diagnosis 

was  reasonable  in  all  the  circumstances,  given  the  limitations  concerning  his 

viewing of the X-rays and the possibility of plaintiff suffering from tuberculosis 

or  another  infection,,  it would  have  been  reasonable  for  him  to  arrange  for  a 

follow up to satisfy himself that the plaintiff’s infection had actually cleared. 

Even if he did not consider, reasonably so, that the plaintiff’s nodule could have 

been  malignant,  on  his  diagnosis,  the  plaintiff  was  still  suffering  from  an 

infection. In my view, it was not sufficient for him to simply give her an open 

date and advise her to return if she felt unwell, particularly because she would 

not know whether any future symptoms would be related to the nodule in her 

lung.  No  expert  in  Dr  Imran’s  speciality  was  called  to  support  Dr  Imran’s 

approach of simply giving the plaintiff an open date and advising her to return 

for  a  review  if  she  was  unwell  or  had  any  pain.  I  therefore  find  that  in  the 

circumstances stated herein and above, Dr Imran breached his duty by failing to 

arrange for the plaintiff to return for a follow up.

Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
Dr Yap and Dr Soh 

[2018] SGHC 35 

77 

I  move  on  to  the  third  and  fourth  defendants.  Dr  Yap  (the  third 

defendant) and Dr Soh (the fourth defendant) attended to the plaintiff as doctors 

who were on duty in the Hospital’s A&E department. The first question is hence 

whether and how the assessment of the breach of duty should be taken in the 

light of the features and limitations of emergency medicine practice.  

(A)  Assessment of breach in an A&E context 

78 

I start with the expert evidence. The only expert in emergency medicine 

called in this trial was A/Prof Mahadevan who heads the Emergency Medicine 

Department  at  National  University  Hospital  (“NUH”).  He  has  been  an 

emergency  medicine  specialist  for  17  years  and  supervises  junior  medial 

officers  in  his  department.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  residency  advisory 

committee, the specialist body that oversees emergency medicine in Singapore. 

It  was  clear  both  from  his  qualifications  and  evidence  on  the  context  and 

standards of emergency medicine practice in Singapore that A/Prof Mahadevan 

was  experienced  and  knowledgeable  in  this  specialty.  Although  Dr  Breen 

offered some opinions on Dr Yap and Dr Soh’s management of the plaintiff, he 

conceded that he was not an emergency physician and had no expertise in that 

field. As mentioned above, the patients routed to Dr Breen are already suspected 

of  specifically  having  lung  cancer,  and  his  main  scope  of  work  involves 

detecting  and  diagnosing  lung  cancer.  The  medical  judgment  calls  Dr  Breen 

makes, including the choice as to the tests to run and the relevant diagnoses to 

make, are significantly different from those an emergency medicine practitioner 

would be expected to make. His evidence thus has limited utility in determining 

the  standard  of  care  required  of  emergency  medicine  doctors.  Thus,  the  only 

expert  witness  on  emergency  medicine  practice  was  A/Prof  Mahadevan. 

 

41
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
Although  I  am  not  bound  to  accept  A/Prof  Mahadevan’s  evidence  solely 

[2018] SGHC 35 

because he was the only expert in emergency medicine practice called,  I find 

that his evidence was based on proper grounds and supported by the basic facts, 

as well as the oral testimonies of the other doctors, and accordingly rely on his 

evidence to determine the standards expected of doctors in emergency medicine 

practice. 

79 

Emergency medicine deals with a wide range of patients and conditions 

but  is  fundamentally  aimed at  treating the acute deterioration of the patient’s 

health,  as  compared  to  a  deeper  and  more  thorough  investigation  into  the 

patient’s  ailments  or  possible  diseases,  which  are  more  appropriately  the 

province of outpatient clinics (such as general practitioners or specialist clinics) 

or  other  hospital  departments.  A/Prof  Mahadevan  explained  that  the  A&E 

doctor’s focus is to detect and exclude life-threatening conditions and primarily 

decide  on  whether  the  patient  needs  to  be  admitted  to  hospital  for  further 

treatment. Even when the patient is not admitted, the A&E doctor would, where 

necessary, route the patient to the Hospital’s specialist outpatient clinics. This 

targeted approach to treatment means that the A&E doctor is not only unable to 

provide a more thorough assessment during the patient’s visit, but is also unable 

to follow through with the patient. 

80 

Two other features of A&E practice in Singapore hospitals arise from 

the  evidence,  which  were  also  recognised  by  the  English  High  Court  in 

Mulholland  v  Medway  NHS  Foundation  Trust  [2015]  EWHC  268  (QB) 

(“Mulholland”)  at  [6].  First,  A&E  departments  process  a  high  volume  of 

patients and work under time constraints. Many of the patients visiting or sent 

to  the  A&E  department  are  either  trauma  victims  (from  motor  or  industrial 

accidents)  or  are  acutely  sick  (strokes  or  heart  attacks)  and  require  urgent 

 

42
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
treatment.  However,  there  are  patients  who  do  not  require  urgent  medical 

[2018] SGHC 35 

treatment who still attend at the A&E unit. The various groups of patients are 

managed  via  the  triage  process  (see  [81]  below).  The  time  for  individual 

consultation with a patient is short as compared to an outpatient clinic. Dr Yap 

gave  evidence  (corroborated  by  Dr  Lim,  a  senior  consultant  at  the  A&E 

department)  that  he  and  other  medical  officers  in  the  emergency  department 

worked  eight-hour  shifts  and  saw  roughly  30  to  35  patients  per  shift.  Each 

consultation  included  taking  a  medical  history,  ordering  the  investigations 

required and sending the patients for these investigations, evaluating the results, 

coming to a diagnosis, and discussing any such diagnosis with a senior doctor. 

81 

Second,  medical  attention  and  treatment  is  delivered  in  a  team-based 

manner  and  the  respective  tasks  of  junior  and  senior  doctors  depends  on  the 

severity of the condition of the patient. Patients would be triaged upon reaching 

the emergency department, meaning that they would be sorted according to the 

urgency  of  care  required.  A/Prof  Mahadevan  explained  that  there  were  three 

priority categories, with “priority 1” being patients in the most critical condition 

and  most  severely  injured,  requiring  immediate  attention.  Patients  triaged  as 

“priority 2” were in less critical condition; those triaged as “priority 3” required 

the least urgent attention and would likely have to wait for a while before being 

attended  to.  The  Hospital’s  emergency  department  was  divided  into  two 

portions,  one  being  an  ambulatory  area,  meaning  that  patients  came  in  by 

themselves, and this area would usually be designated as “priority 3”. In this 

area, junior doctors such as locum medical officers, rotating officers and junior 

residents would attend to patients. These junior doctors were supervised by a 

consultant or senior doctor. They could seek out the supervising senior doctor, 

who was usually within earshot, for advice or consultation. A consultant would 

supervise four to five junior doctors. In the “priority 1” or “priority 2” areas, the 

 

43
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
patients tended to come in through emergency services (such as ambulances). 

[2018] SGHC 35 

Emergency  care  would  be  administered  in  a  team-based  manner  and  junior 

doctors would have to discuss with their senior doctors before making a decision 

on any patient.  

82 

I  accept  that  there  are  limitations  inherent  in  the  provision  of  A&E 

healthcare.  The  environment  in  an  emergency  department  was  frequently 

described  by  the  witnesses  as  “high-stress,  high-intensity”  (Dr  Lim),  “time-

critical” and “overwhelmed” with patients (A/Prof Mahadevan). However, this 

does not mean that the quality of care expected of A&E doctors should be lower, 

or that emergency medicine doctors can behave with impunity with the excuse 

that they are constantly operating under stressful conditions. Competent history 

taking  and  patient  examination,  for  instance,  are  basic  requirements  for  any 

doctor. In FB (by her mother and litigation friend, WAC) v Princess Alexandra 

Hospital NHS Trust [2017] EWCA Civ 334 (“FB”), a senior house officer was 

found to be negligent in not taking an adequate history and examination from a 

child patient’s parents. The child was discharged instead of being referred to the 

paediatric  team.  As  a  result,  her  condition  was  not  diagnosed  till  later  and 

sustained permanent brain damage. The Court of Appeal held that even though 

the  defendant  was  a  senior  house  officer  working  in  an  A&E  department, 

“history taking is a basic skill which hospital doctors at all levels are expected 

to possess” (at [64]). 

83  Ms  Kuah  highlights  (and  Mr  Lek  relies)  on  the  Hospital’s  adequate 

systems and safety nets in place to ensure that the standards and practices in the 

Hospital  are  effective  and  safe.  First,  there  is  a  system  whereby  the  medical 

officers in the A&E department would discuss their cases with senior doctors 

who  would  also  review  the  medical  officers’  X-ray  findings  and  provisional 

 

44
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
diagnosis. Second, the system of routine reporting of X-rays ordered at the A&E 

[2018] SGHC 35 

department. The radiology department would send the X-ray reports back to the 

A&E department within 24 hours for review by a senior doctor on duty at the 

A&E department. Any follow up of the X-ray report would be by the medical 

officer who attended to the patient or by the senior doctor on duty.  

84 

The plaintiff also rightly argues that if a doctor is aware of the limitations 

of  the  treatment  he  can  provide  in  an  A&E  context,  his  duty  may  simply 

translate into sending his patients for follow-up consultations elsewhere instead 

of  simply  discharging  them.  As  stated  in  Jackson  &  Powell  on  Professional 

Liability (John Powell QC and Roger Stewart QC gen eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 

8th Ed, 2017) (“Jackson & Powell”) at [13-025], if a medical practitioner lacks 

the skill and experience to deal with a particular case, he should refer the matter 

to someone who is competent to deal with it. In my view, this equally applies to 

practitioners who, due to the circumstances in which they practice and the limits 

of their institution, are unable to provide the patient with more extensive care. 

85 

Ultimately, the focus and extent of care provided by emergency doctors 

can  be  calibrated  with  the  understanding  that  emergency  medicine  practice 

fulfils a specific role in the healthcare industry, namely the provision of frontline 

treatment in instances of acute deteriorations of health, without compromising 

on the standards expected of an A&E doctor as any other medical professional. 

In my view, when assessing a doctor’s breach of duty in an A&E context, these 

five non-exhaustive factors should be borne in mind: 

(a) 

It is reasonable for A&E doctors to adopt a targeted approach to 

treatment, ie, to be primarily concerned with diagnosing and treating the 

immediate cause of a patient’s acute deterioration in health rather than 

 

45
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 

[2018] SGHC 35 

providing  a  general  health  screening  of  the  patient,  and  determining 

whether the patient should be admitted, retained for further observation, 

or released (with or without follow-up arrangements). 

(b) 

However, like any other medical professional, A&E doctors are 

still  expected  to  make  reasonable  enquiries,  take  a  history  from  the 

patient,  conduct  basic  investigations  and  take  reasonable  care  in 

reaching  their  diagnosis,  especially  when  diagnosing  and  treating  a 

patient’s presenting complaint: Djemal v Bexley Health Authority [1995]

(c) 

The  responsibility  of  A&E  doctors  for 

their  patients’ 

management and treatment should be assessed against the need to make 

speedy decisions and the rotational, shift-based nature of the work. Due 

to these difficulties, A&E doctors work in teams and in shifts.  

(d) 

A&E departments also see a large number of junior doctors who 

have  relatively  less  working  experience.  This  is  mitigated  by  the 

requirement for them to  discuss their cases  and seek approval of their 

intended treatment with a senior doctor on duty. 

(e) 

A&E doctors should act with the awareness of the limitations of 

the  treatment  they  can  provide  in  an  A&E  context.  As  A&E  doctors 

adopted a targeted approach to treatment in an A&E context, when they 

reasonably  suspect  that  the  plaintiff  may  have  an  underlying  health 

problem  which  they  are  unable  to  fully  investigate  or  diagnose,  they 

should  send  the  patient  or  advise  the  patient  to  go  for  follow-up 

consultations in other departments or clinics. The same position may be 

adopted in the case of incidental findings.

 (B)  Dr Yap’s management of the plaintiff 

[2018] SGHC 35 

86 

The plaintiff alleges that Dr Yap breached his duty by (a) failing to refer 

the plaintiff to a respiratory specialist for follow-up but instead discharging her 

with painkillers and/or (b) failing to advise and inform the plaintiff of her “not 

insignificant risk of cancer”. I have already found that (b) is really an allegation 

in relation to diagnosis as Dr Yap did not advise the plaintiff of her risk of cancer 

simply  because  he  had  diagnosed  her  pain  as  musculoskeletal  in  nature  and 

hence did not think that the plaintiff had a risk of cancer. 

87 

I start with my findings on Dr Yap’s consultation with the plaintiff. On 

the night of 29 April 2010, the plaintiff went to the Hospital’s A&E department 

complaining of right-sided mechanical chest pain which was worse  when she 

breathed in deeply, causing her to feel breathless. She was triaged as priority 2 

(ie,  medium  priority;  see  [81]  above)  and  Dr  Yap  attended  to  her  within  ten 

minutes.  He  noted  that  her  general  condition  was  good,  that  she  was  able  to 

speak in full sentences and had clear and equal breath sounds. The Emergency 

Department Record states:

88 

Dr  Yap  gave  evidence  that  he  ordered  the  April  2010  X-ray  for  her 

[2018] SGHC 35 

presenting  complaint  of  chest  pain.  He  observed  as  an  incidental  finding  the 

presence of a suspicious nodule over the right mid-zone of the plaintiff’s chest 

(referred to as “R MZ”) from the April 2010 X-ray (referred to as “CXR”, ie, 

chest X-ray, in the doctor’s notes). He claims that he then accessed the patient’s 

medical  records  from  the  hospital’s  online  portals,  which  showed  that  the 

plaintiff had previously consulted Dr Imran and also the October and November 

2007 X-rays. Although Dr Imran’s notes were not available through the portal, 

Dr Yap states that the plaintiff told him about the consultation with Dr Imran 

and Dr Imran had told her that she was fine, although this is not recorded in the 

doctor’s notes and the plaintiff testified that she did not recall this. I accept Dr 

Yap’s evidence that he had asked the plaintiff about her consultation with Dr 

Imran as part of his investigations regarding the nodule and as part of history-

taking. 

89 

Based  on  the  above,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff’s  pain  had  begun  only 

around an hour before the consultation, and that the nodule appeared stable, Dr 

Yap concluded that the  plaintiff’s pain  was not  attributable to  the nodule but 

musculoskeletal  in  nature,  perhaps  from  muscle  strain  or  inflammation.  He 

discussed 

the  case  with 

the  senior  consultant  on  duty,  Dr  Mohan 

Tiruchittampalam  (“Dr  Mohan”),  showing  him  the  April  2010  X-ray  and 

previous X-rays. He informed Dr Mohan that the plaintiff had been previously 

seen by Dr Imran in 2007. Dr Mohan agreed with Dr Yap’s interpretation that 

the nodule appeared stable and also his diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain. 

He instructed Dr Yap to send the April 2010 X-ray for reporting and recall the 

patient  if  necessary.  The  plaintiff  argues  that  there  are  no  details  of  the 

discussion  between  Dr  Mohan  and  the  plaintiff  in  the  doctor’s  notes  and  Dr 

Mohan was not called as a witness. On this basis, the plaintiff invites the court 

 

48
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
to  draw  an  adverse  inference  that  Dr  Mohan’s  evidence  would  not  have 

[2018] SGHC 35 

corroborated  Dr  Yap’s  account.  I  accept  Dr  Yap’s  evidence  that  he  had 

consulted  with  and  reached  his  decision  with  Dr  Mohan.  The  Emergency 

Department Record corroborates Dr Yap’s claim that he had discussed with Dr 

Mohan (“DW” referred to “discussed with”), and that resulted in a decision to 

send  the  X-ray  for  reporting  and  recall  the  patient  if  necessary.  Although  it 

would have been preferable to have Dr Mohan on the stand for the details of the 

discussion, I find that the contemporaneous doctor’s notes and Dr Yap’s oral 

evidence that he had informed Dr Mohan of the plaintiff’s previous X-rays and 

previous  consultation  with  Dr  Imran  to  be  credible  and  consistent  with  the 

eventual  decision  to  send  the  X-ray  for  reporting  and  recall  the  plaintiff  if 

required. 

90 

On  the  presenting  symptoms  on  that  occasion,  Dr  Yap  diagnosed  the 

plaintiff with musculoskeletal chest pain and discharged her with painkillers. I 

find that he informed the plaintiff of the nodule and advised her that a radiologist 

would review the X-ray and recall her if necessary. This is corroborated by the 

Emergency  Department  Record  stating  the  same  (see  [87]  above).  He  also 

advised her to return if her chest pain worsened or if her fever persisted. The 

April 2010 X-ray was sent for reporting and was reported a day later, although 

Dr Yap testified that he did not personally receive this report.  

91 

I  find  that  Dr  Yap  did  not  fall  below  the  applicable  standard  of  care. 

First, it must be emphasised that the nodule in the plaintiff’s lung was, in the 

case of Dr Yap, an incidental finding arising from the April 2010 X-ray which 

Dr  Yap  reasonably  determined  was  unrelated  to  the  plaintiff’s  presenting 

complaint,  ie,  her  chest  pain  and  shortness  of  breath.  The  chest  X-ray  was 

ordered  to  examine  the  plaintiff’s  presenting  complaint  of  chest  pain  and  to 

 

49
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
exclude any life-threatening conditions, and not to follow up on the nodule. His 

[2018] SGHC 35 

own assessment that night that there had been no clinically significant change 

in the size of the plaintiff’s nodule since the November 2007 X-ray and that the 

nodule possessed no other obvious signs of malignancy was supported by other 

doctors, such as Dr Rameysh, the radiologist who reported the April 2010 X-

ray, and Prof Goh. Further, A/Prof Mahadevan testified that A&E doctors were 

not expected to measure opacities on X-rays during their consultations due to 

time constraints and I accept that it was reasonable for Dr Yap to have assessed 

the nodule without measuring it the way a radiologist would have. Dr Yap also 

rightly relied on the facts that the plaintiff was young, had no symptoms of lung 

cancer,  no  weight  loss,  and  that  her  other  symptoms  were  related  to  her 

presenting complaints, to conclude that her pain was unlikely to be caused by 

the nodule and was musculoskeletal in nature. Given his diagnosis, there was 

no clinical basis to send the patient for further investigations or to arrange for a 

further consultation with a specialist. Dr Yap’s assessment was fully supported 

by  A/Prof  Mahadevan  and  was  in  line  with  a  responsible  body  of  medical 

opinion. 

92 

Second, Dr Yap had noted the previous consultation with Dr Imran and 

discussed it with the plaintiff. I accept A/Prof Mahadevan’s opinion (which I 

find to be logical and defensible) that since Dr Yap was aware that the nodule 

was a known finding and the plaintiff had been seen by a respiratory specialist 

in 2007, it was reasonable for him to conclude that an assessment had been done 

and  the  patient  had  been  discharged  from  respiratory  follow-up  because  her 

condition was not serious, and this had been confirmed by the plaintiff saying 

that  Dr  Imran  had  told  her  that  she  was  fine.  I  do  not  see  the  usefulness  of 

comparing Dr Yeo’s referral of the plaintiff to Dr Imran and Dr Yap’s discharge 

of the plaintiff as relevant to the issue of breach. Having independently assessed 

 

50
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
that there had been no significant change to the nodule since 2007, I find that it 

[2018] SGHC 35 

was  reasonable  for  Dr  Yap  to  decide  that  a  referral  back  to  a  respiratory 

specialist  outpatient  clinic  was  unnecessary  unless  the  radiologist’s  report 

suggested otherwise. 

93 

It bears note that Dr Yap’s assessment of the nodule as stable turned out 

to be correct and consistent with the radiologist’s assessment, even though this 

was not known to him at the material time. The April 2010 X-ray report was 

prepared by Dr Rameysh and stated that: 

A  rounded  opacity…  is  seen  in  the  [right]  mid  zone,  which 
appears  stable  since  the  previous  chest  radiograph  [in 
November  2007].  This  is  non  specific  and  is  indeterminate  in 
nature.  A 
for 
assessment of interval stability. The rest of the visualised lung 
parenchyma shows no significant abnormality … 

follow-up  radiograph  may  be  performed 

94 

Dr Rameysh’s report shows that he considered the nodule to be stable 

and suggested that a follow-up radiograph be performed only for the purposes 

of  assessing  interval  stability,  and  not  because  malignancy  was  suspected. 

Further,  the  evidence  from  the  medical  literature  and  Prof  Goh  was  that  a 

nodule, being a non-calcified pulmonary nodule (as in the present case), would 

have  been  assumed  to  be  benign  by  a  reasonably  competent  doctor  if  it  had 

exhibited interval stability, ie, was found to be stable over a period of two years 

using  X-rays.  Dr  Breen,  the  plaintiff’s  expert,  agreed  with  this  in  principle, 

although he testified that the nodule should only be considered stable if it had 

displayed no change at all or if there is calcification in the nodule. I have already 

found that a nodule can be considered stable if it displays only slight or marginal 

increase  in  growth,  and  Dr  Breen  himself  accepted  that  a  nodule’s  stability 

would  be  better  assessed  by  a  radiologist.  From  2007  to  2010,  the  plaintiff’s 

nodule displayed such interval  stability.  This  would  have led to  a  conclusion 

 

51
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
that  the  nodule  was  benign  in  nature.  Although  the  plaintiff  argues  that  her 

[2018] SGHC 35 

cancer could have been slow-growing, as Dr Teo explained, the knowledge that 

that slow-growing tumours are not necessarily benign is relatively new, and this 

point applies a fortiori to indolent ALK-positive cancer, as ALK-related cancer 

was  relatively  unchartered  territory  at  or  about  the  time  when  the  plaintiff’s 

cancer was discovered. 

95 

Third, I find that Dr Yap’s decision to have the X-ray reported and wait 

for its results before any further clinical decision was made, which was fully 

supported by A/Prof Mahadevan, to be reasonable. The plaintiff argues that Dr 

Yap should have referred her back to Dr Imran or another respiratory specialist, 

given that Dr Imran had already given the plaintiff an open date to return to the 

clinic. I agree with A/Prof Mahadevan that it was entirely reasonable for Dr Yap 

to wait and see whether or not the radiologist had any concerns with the X-ray, 

before taking the decision as to whether to recall the plaintiff and/or refer her 

back to the specialist. There could have been a variety of radiological findings 

and differential diagnoses for the plaintiff’s lung nodule, and it was eminently 

sensible  to  wait  for  the  radiological  report  to  help  in  the  assessment  of  the 

plaintiff’s condition and aided the clinical decision. Further, a doctor should not 

always be expected to refer a patient back to his specialist as a matter of course, 

especially when he reasonably believes (as did Dr  Yap) that the specialist has 

already assessed the nodule and it has displayed no significant change and no 

obvious malignancy since the last assessment.  

96 

Fourth, it was also reasonable for Dr Yap to send the April 2010 X-ray 

for reporting without personally following up on it, relying on the Hospital’s 

processes  that  X-rays  with  clinically  significant  abnormalities  would  be  sent 

back  to  the  A&E  department  and  assessed  by  a  senior  doctor  on  duty.  The 

 

52
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
plaintiff is therefore wrong to argue that Dr Yap was negligent in only relying 

[2018] SGHC 35 

on his limited time and diagnostic resources in an A&E setting. Dr Yap knew 

and relied on the fact that the radiology department would report the X-ray and 

return  it  to  the  A&E  department  if  follow-up  was  required.  In  Mulholland, 

Green  J  found  (at  [95]-[96])  that  the  A&E  department  “could  not  function 

sensibly without mutual reliance on the professionalism of others involved in 

the overall A&E process”. Doctors in the A&E department work on shifts and 

reasonably  rely  on  the  hospital’s  processes  and  each  doctor  performing  their 

own role when they are on duty. It would be onerous and incompatible with the 

Hospital’s  allocation  of  responsibilities  for  each  A&E  doctor  to  have  to 

personally  follow  up  with  every  patient  they  see,  given  the  high  volume  of 

patients and the targeted approach adopted in the A&E department. 

97 

Fifth, in relation to whether Dr Yap should have ordered a CT scan for 

the plaintiff, I again find that it was reasonable for Dr Yap to have delayed any 

such decision until the X-ray had been reported, so that a fuller assessment could 

be  made.  In  any  event,  given  Dr  Yap’s  assessment  of  the  nodule  and  his 

diagnosis that the plaintiff’s presenting complaint was unrelated to the nodule 

in her lung (see [91] above), there was simply no symptoms to indicate at the 

time of the plaintiff’s consultation that a CT scan was appropriate or required. 

Further, the use of CT scans in the Hospital’s A&E department at the material 

time was limited to urgent or emergent cases such as strokes, major trauma and 

other vascular emergencies requiring immediate imaging. The A&E department 

also did not have CT scanners in 2010 and 2011 and patients requiring it would 

have to be sent to the main hospital block where the radiology department was. 

I accept A/Prof Mahadevan’s evidence that the plaintiff would not have been 

considered a patient urgently requiring a CT scan.

Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
98 

Finally,  even  if  Dr  Yap  had  been  wrong  or  hasty  in  his  diagnosis,  he 

[2018] SGHC 35 

nevertheless discharged his duty by seeking confirmation and advice from his 

senior doctor, Dr Mohan. Although the standard of care for junior doctors is the 

same as that of a senior, more experienced doctor professing to have the same 

skill and competence in A&E, a junior doctor who seeks the advice and help of 

the  senior  doctors  would  often  have  satisfied  the  test:  Wilsher  v  Essex  Area 

Health Authority  [1987] 1 QB 730 (“Wilsher”)  at 774C-H. This  is  especially 

relevant in the A&E context as it is common for junior doctors to train and gain 

experience in A&E departments in Singapore hospitals, under the supervision 

of more senior doctors. Dr Yap was, at the material time, working as a junior 

doctor under the supervision of the senior consultant on duty, Dr Mohan. All 

decisions  for  patients  in  the  priority  2  category  needed  to  be  referred  to  the 

senior  doctor  on  duty,  and  Dr  Yap  accordingly  discussed  and  confirmed  his 

diagnosis and proposed treatment with Dr Mohan. Whether Dr Mohan made the 

right decision or had otherwise failed to fulfil his duty to the plaintiff is beyond 

the remit of this case, as the plaintiff not sued Dr Mohan.  

99 

For the reasons above, I find that Dr Yap met the professional standard 

of  care.  For  the  plaintiff’s  presenting  complaints,  he  discharged  the  plaintiff 

with  painkillers  and  advised  her  to  return  if  the  pain  worsened  or  the  fever 

persisted.  In  relation  to  the  incidental  finding  of  the  plaintiff’s  nodule,  he 

reasonably  assessed  that  it  was  unrelated  to  her  presenting  complaints, 

diagnosed it as stable but sent the X-ray for reporting for confirmation of the 

nodule by a radiologist. 

(C)  Dr Soh’s management of the plaintiff 

100  Around a year after the plaintiff’s consultation with Dr Yap, the plaintiff 

again visited the Hospital’s A&E Department on the night of 31 July 2011 and 

 

54
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
was seen by the fourth defendant, Dr Soh. She complained of left lower ribcage 

[2018] SGHC 35 

pain  that  had  persisted  for  almost  one  month,  and  was  triaged  as  priority  3 

(lowest priority). Dr Soh attended to her within the hour.  

101  Dr Soh gave evidence that given the complaints of pain, he focused on 

ruling  out  life-threatening  cardiac  causes  of  acute  coronary  syndrome,  rib 

fractures,  pneumothorax,  pulmonary  embolism  and  infective  changes.  He 

ordered a chest X-ray in erect and left oblique views (“the July 2011 X-ray”) 

and an ECG. He scanned the X-ray for major abnormalities and moved to the 

area  of  concern,  namely  the  lower  left  ribcage,  which  did  not  show  any  rib 

fractures or abnormalities. Due to his focus on the left chest, he did not notice 

the  plaintiff’s  nodule  in  the  right  chest.  He  thus  provisionally  diagnosed  the 

plaintiff’s pain as “costochondritis”, namely pain of a musculoskeletal origin.  

102  Being a junior medical officer, he discussed the case with Dr Lim (this 

is  reflected  in  his  contemporaneous  notes  in  the  Emergency  Department 

Record), the supervising consultant on duty. Dr Soh then discharged the plaintiff 

with oral and topical analgesia (to relieve the pain) and asked her to return if her 

symptoms worsened or persisted. 

103 

The  plaintiff  provides  a  different  account  of  her  consultation.  She 

testified that Dr Soh had noticed and highlighted to her that there was something 

on her right lung, asked whether she had any tattoos on her right chest, but told 

her  that  her  problem  was  the  inflammation  of  the  ribs.  She  subsequently 

conveyed this to Dr Wong, who recorded that during a consultation in December 

2011, the plaintiff told him that during her visit to the Hospital in July 2011, 

“the emergency [medical officer]  noted a shadow in [her] right  mid zone but 

thought was smaller, but was asymptomatic at the time”. 

 

55
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
104 

I  find  Dr  Soh’s  account  to  be  more  credible  than  the  plaintiff’s  and 

[2018] SGHC 35 

consistent with the objective facts. First, without yet deciding whether it was 

reasonable  to  do  so,  I  accept  Dr  Soh’s  explanation  that  he  did  not  notice the 

nodule as he was focused on the lower left area of the chest. This was why he 

ordered  an  X-ray  image  in  the  left  oblique  view.  Both  Dr  Lim  and  Dr  Soh 

testified that the nodule in the plaintiff’s right lung could not be seen in the left 

oblique view X-ray image. Although the nodule could be seen in the erect view, 

and was seen by everyone at the time of trial, I would not assume that Dr Soh, 

without the benefit of hindsight, would have been able to spot it in July 2011, 

during the A&E consultation. His admission was also more credible as it was 

not obviously to his benefit, since he could be blamed for his oversight when 

two other A&E doctors had been able to spot the nodule. Second, although the 

plaintiff relies on Dr Wong’s notes, these only show that the plaintiff stated in 

December 2011 that Dr Soh had mentioned a shadow in her right lung. Dr Wong 

was  not  present  at  the  Hospital  and  his  evidence  as  to  what  happened  there 

would  be  hearsay.  Third,  even  if  Dr  Soh  did  ask  whether  the  plaintiff  had  a 

tattoo on her right chest, it was unlikely to be because he saw the nodule, given 

that  tattoos  (being  ink  on  the  skin)  would  not  usually  show  up  in  an  X-ray 

(assuming he did ask). Dr Teo also testified that tattoos could only be seen on 

X-rays in a very limited situation, ie, when they had radio-opaque elements such 

as  metal,  and  she  had  never  seen  a  tattoo  appearing  on  an  X-ray.  Fourth,  I 

accepted as plausible Dr Soh’s argument that the plaintiff could have mixed up 

her  consultations  with  Dr  Yap  and  Dr  Soh,  especially  given  that  she  did  not 

remember being told about the nodule during her consultation with Dr Yap even 

though  it  was  recorded  in  the  doctor’s  notes  and  supported  by  Dr  Yap’s 

evidence, which I have found to be credible, that he had explained the presence 

of the nodule to her (see [87] and [90] above). 

 

56
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
105 

The July 2011 X-ray was reported a day after the plaintiff’s consultation. 

[2018] SGHC 35 

The report stated that the “opacity in the [right mid zone] is again noted”, was 

slightly  larger  as  compared  to  that  captured  in  the  April  2010  X-ray,  “non-

specific in nature and largely stable since the previous study”. Follow up of the 

lesion was suggested. Dr Soh did not personally receive the report and there was 

no follow up on this X-ray in the Hospital’s records.  

106 

I move on to the assessment of breach. The principal difference between 

Dr Soh’s case and Dr Yap’s was Dr Soh’s failure to notice the nodule on the X-

ray.  The  plaintiff  argues  that  a  reasonable  A&E  doctor,  trained  to  read  and 

interpret X-rays, ought to be able to identify major abnormalities in an X-ray, 

such as the presence of a nodule. The nodule on the plaintiff’s right lung in the 

mid  zone  area  was  only  a  few  inches  away  from  Dr  Soh’s  area  of  concern, 

namely the plaintiff’s left ribcage. In particular, both Dr Yeo and Dr Yap, who 

had attended to the plaintiff, had been able to spot the nodule, notwithstanding 

that they also ordered and viewed the X-ray in an A&E context and determined 

that it was unrelated to the plaintiff’s presenting complaint.  

107  Having considered the plaintiff’s arguments, I find that Dr Soh did not 

fall below the applicable standard of care by failing to notice the nodule in the 

plaintiff’s right lung as he had focused on the plaintiff’s presenting complaint 

(left rib pain). The distinction between an A&E doctor’s responsibility for an 

incidental finding and the patient’s presenting complaint (see [85(a)] above) is 

again  emphasised.  Given  the  purpose  of  the  A&E  department  to  deliver 

emergency front-line treatment, the high numbers of patients, the accordingly 

short time allocated to each consultation and the limited facilities available at 

the A&E department, an A&E doctor’s primary focus is to diagnose and treat 

the plaintiff’s presenting complaint. He is not expected to make findings beyond 

 

57
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
what  he  reasonably  deems  is  required  to  treat  the  plaintiff’s  presenting 

[2018] SGHC 35 

symptoms. With this in mind, I find that it was reasonable for Dr Yap to have 

focused on the plaintiff’s left lower chest  given her complaint of pain in that 

area, as opposed to  other  areas of her chest.  He  ordered the X-ray in  the left 

oblique view for this purpose (where the nodule could not be seen). Dr Lim also 

testified that it was unlikely that the pain on the plaintiff’s left rib could have 

radiated from the plaintiff’s right lung. 

108  A/Prof Mahadevan supported Dr Soh’s targeted approach  towards the 

plaintiff’s presenting complaint, focusing on the plaintiff’s left chest to look for 

a cause of the pain, which was chronic, by focusing on a rib injury or a burst 

lung. He also emphasised that Dr Yeo (who saw the plaintiff in 2007 and spotted 

nodule) and Dr Soh’s consultations were “two very different clinical scenarios” 

with  very  different  approaches  to  the  problem,  and  should  not  be  validly 

compared.  Dr  Soh  focused  on  the  plaintiff’s  left  chest  with  a  presumptive 

diagnosis of costochondritis. Thus, his consultation was focused on excluding 

possible diagnoses for the plaintiff’s month-long left-sided chest pain, such as 

pulmonary embolism, a missed fracture of the ribs, bone erosion, pneumothorax 

or burst lung. This was distinct from Dr Yeo’s first consultation in 2007 with 

the plaintiff, where she presented with lower central chest pain which was rather 

non-specific in  nature.  In the first  consultation with  Mr Yeo, he took  a  more 

holistic approach to the situation back in 2007 and spotted the nodule in the X-

ray. 

109 

Further,  A/Prof  Mahadevan  also  observed  that  there  was  inadequate 

inspiration  on  the  July  2011  X-ray  and  that  there  were  many  other  white 

structures within the black lung field which could be confused as abnormalities. 

It was hence understandable that Dr Soh might have missed the nodule without 

 

58
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
the  benefit  of  hindsight,  and  the  possibility  of  such  discrepant  findings  is 

[2018] SGHC 35 

precisely the reason why routine reporting is carried out for all X-rays, which is 

what I come to now. Dr Soh was fully aware that the July 2011 X-ray would be 

reported in the usual manner and any abnormal findings would be routed back 

to the A&E department, with a clinical assessment being made on the basis of 

the report by the doctor on duty. Like Dr Yap (see [95]-[96] above), he was fully 

entitled to rely on this system. The same reasoning applying to Dr Yap would 

also apply in relation to the lack of need to order a CT scan until the results of 

the X-ray report were out. 

110 

Finally,  even  if  Dr  Soh  had  made  a  mistake  in  not  picking  up  on  the 

nodule, he would have fulfilled his duty of care by explaining and confirming 

his diagnosis and treatment of costochrondritis with his senior doctor on duty, 

Dr Lim. Dr Soh testified that he could not specifically recall what was discussed, 

but stated that as a matter of routine, he would inform the supervising consultant 

of  the  patient’s  history,  his  observations  during  physical  examination, 

diagnoses,  results  of  any  investigations  (ie,  the  X-ray)  and  a  provisional 

diagnosis and treatment plan, and Dr Lim agreed with him. Dr Lim stated that 

although  he  could  not  recall  the  precise  consultation,  given  the  plaintiff’s 

history,  examination,  complaints,  and  absence  of  other  symptoms,  he  would 

have considered Dr Soh’s diagnosis of costochrondritis as fair and reasonable 

and  agreed  to  the  treatment  plan.  He  reviewed  the  X-rays  personally  and 

similarly  did  not  notice  the  nodule  in  the  plaintiff’s  right  lung.  I  accept  their 

evidence,  which  is  consistent  with  the  Hospital’s  A&E  department’s  work 

process.  As mentioned at  [98] in  relation  to  Dr Yap, a  junior medical  officer 

who actively checks his work with his senior doctor and confirms his diagnosis 

and treatment plan will generally be taken to have met the applicable standard 

of care, and I so find in the present case.

[2018] SGHC 35 

111 

I  now  move  on  to  the  Hospital’s  alleged  breaches.  The  plaintiff’s 

allegations as to the Hospital’s breach of duty take two forms. The first is that 

the individual doctors (ie, the second to  fourth defendants) were negligent  in 

attending to the plaintiff. The Hospital does not dispute as a matter of principle 

that it would be liable for the negligent acts of Dr Imran, Dr Yap and Dr Soh. 

That  said,  the  legal  basis  upon  which  the  plaintiff  seeks  to  establish  the 

Hospital’s liability is unclear from the pleadings. The liability of a defendant 

for  another  person’s  torts  can  be  based  on  a  variety  of  doctrines,  such  as 

vicarious liability, agency principles, or the existence of a non-delegable duty. 

Mr Rai, on behalf of the plaintiff, submits that it is trite law that hospitals would 

be vicariously liable for their doctors’ torts if the doctors committed such torts 

during  the  course  of  their  employment,  but  did  not  actually  plead  vicarious 

liability.  He appears to  contend instead that the  Hospital  owed the plaintiff a 

non-delegable duty of care and was thus directly liable for the second to fourth 

defendants’ negligence. 

112 

The principle that hospitals owe their patients non-delegable duties has 

not  yet  been  expressly  endorsed  in  Singapore.  The  Court  of  Appeal  in 

Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3322 v Tiong Aik Construction 

Pte Ltd and another [2016] 4 SLR 521 (“Tiong Aik”) formulated a two-stage 

test for determining whether a non-delegable duty would arise on a given set of 

facts, namely (a) whether the case fell within an established category of non-

delegable  duties  or  possessed  the  five  features  outlined  in  Woodland  v 

Swimming  Teachers  Association  [2014]  AC  537  (“Woodland”)  and  (b)  if  so, 

whether  it  would  be  fair  and  reasonable  to  impose  such  a  duty  (Tiong  Aik  at 

[62]). It was further observed (at [47(a)]) that in other jurisdictions such as the 

 

60
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
United Kingdom, hospitals and health authorities have been held to owe non-

[2018] SGHC 35 

delegable duties to their patients, although the High Court in Hii Chii Kok v Ooi 

Peng Jin London Lucien and another [2016] 2 SLR 544 left the question open. 

The  Court  of  Appeal  also  cautioned  that  whether  Singapore  law  should 

recognise  a  non-delegable  duty  in  such  a  scenario  “[remained]  to  be  decided 

should the appropriate case come before our courts” (Tiong Aik at [48]).  

113  On  the  question  whether  the  Hospital  should  be  held  to  owe  a  non-

delegable  duty  of  care  to  the  plaintiff  in  respect  of  the  healthcare  services 

provided  to  her  by  Dr  Imran  (as  part  of  the  Hospital’s  specialist  outpatient 

clinic), Dr Yap and Dr Soh (as part of the Hospital’s A&E department), it is not 

necessary  to  decide  on  the  matter  since  the  Hospital  does  not  dispute  that  it 

could be made vicariously liable for the negligence of the defendant-doctors. I 

also note that the Court of Appeal has twice declined to decide or discuss this 

point where it is unnecessary to do so for the disposal of the case before it (Tiong 

Aik at [48] and Hii Chii Kok at [222]). Since I have already found that causation 

is  simply  not  made  out  in  the  plaintiff’s  case,  and  the  plaintiff’s  claim  in 

negligence thus fails, it is a moot question whether Singapore should recognise 

a non-delegable duty in this scenario. Besides, without the benefit of detailed 

argument by both parties (the Hospital does not contest the issue), I leave the 

question of whether a hospital owes non-delegable duties to its patients for a 

future court to fully address. 

114 

I now turn to the second form of breach that the plaintiff alleges, namely, 

that the Hospital failed to provide a safe system of healthcare.  I note that this 

has nothing to do with the issue of whether the Hospital owes a non-delegable 

duty to the plaintiff. A hospital can be held directly liable in negligence for such 

its  own  organisational  failure,  which  may  include  failing  to  provide  suitable 

 

61

medical facilities and equipment or doctors with sufficient skill and experience, 

[2018] SGHC 35 

or  failing  to  implement  safeguards  in  its  system  or  to  supervise  its  staff:  see 

Clerk & Lindsell at [10-93] and Wilsher at 465. The Hospital similarly does not 

dispute that such liability may exist in principle.  

115 

The  plaintiff’s  submissions  primarily  relate  to  Hospital’s  provision  of 

radiological facilities and services (ie, the reporting, handling and processing of 

X-rays). I find that most of her claims have no merit, save for the plea that the 

Hospital  breached  its  duty  by  failing  to  have  a  patient  notification  system  to 

inform the plaintiff of the results and findings in her X-ray report. 

116 

The  plaintiff  claims  that  the  Hospital  did  not  establish  an  adequate 

system for the reporting of X-rays and for follow up on abnormal radiological 

findings.  The  Hospital  did  not  implement  routine  reporting  for  X-rays  until 

2010. This meant that the November 2007 X-ray ordered by Dr Imran would 

not have been reported unless requested. The October and November 2007 X-

rays were only retrospectively reported in 2012. I have already found that it was 

reasonable for Dr Imran to not send the X-ray for reporting (see [75] above). Mr 

Rai does not argue that it was a breach of the Hospital’s duty not to have routine 

reporting in 2007. Even if he does, he has failed to adduce any evidence showing 

that this was the standard in the healthcare industry or that it was otherwise an 

unreasonable system. There is thus no basis upon which to find a breach of duty. 

By 2010, routine reporting was implemented and the April 2010 and July 2011 

X-rays (ordered by Dr Yap and Dr Soh respectively) were accordingly sent for 

reporting. The Hospital has produced both reports, each dated only a day after 

the  X-rays  were  taken.  Dr  Teo  opined  that  the  24-hour  turnaround  time  was 

reasonable and I agree with her. 

 

62
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
117 

The plaintiff argues that the Hospital breached its duty by failing to route 

[2018] SGHC 35 

the radiological reports back to their ordering doctors. It was not disputed that 

neither  Dr  Yap  nor  Dr  Soh  received  the  plaintiff’s  radiological  reports.  The 

Hospital instead contends that although the reports were not routed back to Dr 

Yap and Dr Soh, they had implemented a safety net by ensuring that (a) reports 

with  abnormal  radiological  findings  would  be  routed  back  to  the  relevant 

department (in this case, the A&E department) and (b) such reports would be 

reviewed  by  the  senior  doctor  on  duty  (“the  reviewing  doctor”),  who  would 

decide  whether  to  recall  the  patient.  This  was  evidenced  by  a  set  of  the 

Hospital’s work instructions in 2011, titled “Notification of Critical Results by 

Radiology Department”. Dr Andrew Tan testified that there was already such a 

process in place prior to the work instructions but the document was created to 

include an additional layer of action to  be taken  for radiological  reports  with 

more critical findings. Abnormal findings would be classified from level 3 to 

level 5. The plaintiff’s April 2010 and July 2011 X-rays would have been a level 

3,  ie,  with  clinically  significant  abnormalities.  Such  reports  would  then  be 

marked out and sent back to the relevant department. The essential elements of 

this process were corroborated by various witness, including Dr Rameysh (who 

reported the April 2010 X-ray), Dr Khoo (a diagnostic radiologist working in 

the Hospital), Dr Yap, Dr Soh and Dr Lim (from the A&E department). I hence 

find that there was such a work process, and agree with Dr Teo that  it was a 

reasonable  process  and  would  fulfil  the  Hospital’s  duty  of  care  towards  the 

patient in ensuring that abnormal radiological findings were noted and followed 

up on. In particular, given that the radiological reports would not be available 

the same night, it was reasonable to discharge the patient first and recall her if 

necessary. It was also reasonable for another doctor to review the radiological 

report  as  doctors  in  the  A&E  department  worked  in  shifts  (this  would  have 

 

63
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v

ensured  that  the  reports  were  reviewed  timeously)  and  they  would  also  have 

[2018] SGHC 35 

access to the patient’s medical file. 

118 

The next question is whether this process was in fact carried out in the 

plaintiff’s case. There was a gap in the evidence because (a) the X-ray request 

forms, which the radiologists would have stamped “Attention” on and routed 

back to the relevant department if the radiological findings had been abnormal, 

had been disposed of six months after the X-rays and were unavailable; and (b) 

there was no record of the senior doctor who had reviewed the X-ray and made 

the clinical decision not to recall the plaintiff. Despite this, I find on a balance 

of probabilities that such a process was indeed carried out in the plaintiff’s case. 

First, as seen in the abovementioned paragraph, various witnesses testified to 

the  Hospital’s  work  process  for  handling  X-rays  and  there  was  nothing  to 

suggest that such a process was not implemented as a matter of fact. I accept the 

Hospital’s explanation that the X-ray request forms had been disposed of and 

were simply unavailable.  Second, it was entirely  plausible  that the reviewing 

doctor’s  decision  would  have  been  not  to  recall  the  plaintiff,  given  that  both 

radiological  reports  had  stated  that  the  nodule  was  stable.  Although  they 

suggested  follow-up,  the  April  2010  X-ray  report  only  suggested  it  for 

assessment of interval stability. Further, the reviewing doctor would have access 

to  more  information  on  the  plaintiff,  such  as  her  young  age  and  lack  of 

symptoms. Thus,  I  find it  more likely than not  that  the  reporting and routing 

process  had  been  carried  out  and  the  reviewing  doctor  had  taken  the  clinical 

decision not to recall the plaintiff. The Hospital hence did not breach its duty of 

care towards the plaintiff in this respect. 

119  However, I find that the Hospital breached its duty of care by failing to 

send the April 2010 and July 2011 X-ray reports with its findings to the plaintiff 

 

64
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
following  her  consultation  with  Dr  Yap  and  Dr  Soh,  or  otherwise  failing  to 

[2018] SGHC 35 

communicate  the  findings  of  the  X-ray  reports  to  the  plaintiff,  even  after  the 

reviewing doctor had assessed that there was no need for further follow-up. The 

plaintiff pleaded that the Hospital breached its duty in not informing her of the 

results of her X-ray reports, and I find that this was a weakness of the Hospital’s 

routine reporting system, which the Hospital constantly claims is a key safety 

net  to  ensure  accurate  radiological  findings  and  diagnoses.  The  system  of 

routine reporting was implemented precisely to ensure that abnormal findings 

would  be  looked  into.  It  is  the  Hospital’s  case  that  routine  reporting  was  an 

integral safety net, especially for doctors in the A&E department who did not 

have opportunity to thoroughly examine the X-ray for abnormalities. This also 

means that the results of such X-ray reports are a significant part of the diagnosis 

and management of the Hospital’s patients.  

120 

That being the case, as part of this safety net, the Hospital should have 

had a patient notification system to inform the plaintiff of the results of her X-

ray report, even if it had decided that there was no need for further follow-up. I 

accept that it was not feasible to discharge the patient only after the X-ray had 

been reported, especially when the A&E doctor had diagnosed the plaintiff and 

treated her based on his diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain and costochondritis. 

I have also found (at [117]-[118] above) that the Hospital did not fall below its 

applicable  standard  of  care  in  having  the  reports  routed  back  to  the  A&E 

department for review by the ordering doctor or a senior doctor on duty.  

121  However, it would only be reasonable for the plaintiff to be notified of 

the results of such reports and of the clinical decision made as to her condition 

as part of the doctor’s communication of his diagnosis, and so as to enable the 

patient to be informed of her condition and take the decision as to whether to 

 

65
--------
Noor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v 
Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd 
 
 
return to the Hospital for consultation, seek a second opinion elsewhere or to do 

[2018] SGHC 35 

nothing. This is especially so for Dr Yap, who had in fact personally requested 

that the plaintiff be sent the X-ray report. The Emergency Department Record 

stated,  under  the  section  on  disposal,  “send  [chest  X-ray]  for  reporting”  and 

“please mail report to patient”. Next to it was “noted”. Despite this, there is no 

evidence that the report was eventually mailed to the plaintiff or that there was 

any system in place to relay the results of the report to the plaintiff. Given that 

Dr Yap had advised her that there was a nodule in her lung and that the report 

would  be  sent  for  reporting  and  she  would  be  recalled  if  necessary,  and 

presumably (from the Emergency Department Record) the plaintiff had asked 

for or otherwise been promised the X-ray report, it was only reasonable for the 

Hospital to have at least sent the report to the plaintiff so that she had knowledge 

of  its  contents.  The  April  2010  X-ray  report  in  fact  stated  that  a  follow-up 

radiograph  could  be  performed  for  interval  stability  and  the  July  2011  X-ray 

report  suggested  follow-up.  The  plaintiff  should  have  been  informed  of  the 

contents  of  the  reports,  such  that  even  if  the  reviewing  doctors  did  not  think 

(reasonably so) that follow-up was warranted, she could seek a second opinion 

if she so wished. 

122  How the patient notification process should be carried out in these cases 

depends on the circumstances. It may be sufficient simply to email the report to 

the patient, or, in other cases, a follow-up consultation to explain the findings 

to her may be required. In determining this, I return to the distinction between 

an  incidental  finding  and  a  presenting  complaint  (see  [85(e)]  above).  If  the 

finding is related to or has an impact on the patient’s presenting complaint, it 

may be part of the Hospital’s duty to call the patient back to explain the findings 

to her, notwithstanding that no further intervention is assessed to be required. If 

the finding is incidental to her presenting complaint, and it has been assessed to 

 

66
--------

not require clinical intervention, it is sufficient to simply email the report to the 

[2018] SGHC 35 

patient to ensure that she has a copy of her X-ray report, the clinical decision 

made, and the choice as to whether to seek further medical assistance. 

Conclusion on breach 

123 

In relation to the defendants’ duty of care, I find that: 

(a) 

Dr Imran had breached his duty towards the plaintiff by failing 

to recall her for a follow-up to ensure that her opacity had completely 

resolved. 

(b) 

 The Hospital had breached its duty of care towards the plaintiff 

by failing to inform her of the results of her X-ray reports (ie, for the 

April 2010 and July 2011 X-rays) and the clinical decision made thereto 

as to her condition.  

(c) 

Dr Yap and Dr Soh had not breached their duty of care towards 

the plaintiff. 

However, given my findings on causation, there are no causative breaches by 

Dr  Imran  and  the  Hospital.  In  the  circumstances,  the  plaintiff’s  action  in 

negligence fails against all the four defendants . 

Conclusion 

124 

The plaintiff’s action against all the defendants is dismissed. I will hear 

parties  on  costs.  The  parties  are  to  exchange  their  respective  submissions  on 

costs (including on quantum seeing that the parties have submitted their costs 

schedules) within 21 days hereof. Such submissions shall be limited to 3 pages 

each.
