The appellant was convicted on a charge of abetting by instigation the commission of housebreaking and theft by night, contrary to s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with s 34. The persons the appellant were alleged to have abetted were Narendran s/o Govindaraj (PW5), Ramesh s/o Ramachandra (Ramesh), Suraj Babu s/o Mndraju (DW2), Selvam s/o Munusamy (also known as Veera) and one Subramaniam (Steven). The theft took place on 7 September 1992 at about 1am at the British Club. I will refer to this incident as the `British Club break-in`.
 The prosecution`s evidence
The prosecution relied solely on PW5`s testimony. PW5 is currently serving six years` corrective training for a series of offences. On 19 December 1992, he pleaded guilty to the British Club break-in, together with some other offences. He was, on that occasion, sentenced to a total of four years and four months` imprisonment. There was no mention of the appellant in the statement of facts which he admitted to on that occasion. In that statement of facts, he had agreed that the burglary was planned by Steven. PW5 said that he implicated the appellant in 1996 because he had `a guilty conscience` and that it `was not fair` that the appellant had escaped unpunished.
On 3 June 1996, PW5 was arrested by the police on suspicion of a housebreaking at a building known as the Leksun Industrial Building which occurred the previous day. He also implicated the appellant in that break-in, which I will refer to as the `Leksun break-in`. It was common ground that the appellant had nothing to do with that offence. The appellant was arrested on the same day as a result of PW5`s accusation. The only explanation PW5 proferred for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in was that he was confused because he faced seven other charges at the time.
PW5 first met the appellant sometime in the middle of 1992. The appellant was a security guard at BP Singapore Pte Ltd when PW5 started work there. A few days later, the appellant was transferred to another location. They kept in touch with each other over the phone.
According to PW5, the appellant telephoned him and asked him if he was interested in breaking into the British Club. The appellant gave him the details concerning the location of the British Club and what items could be found there. The appellant told PW5 that Steven would give him the details of how it was to be done. One or two days later, Steven went alone to PW5`s workplace. PW5 said that this was not the first time that he met Steven. They discussed the break-in in a taxi when they left. Steven suggested a date but said that he wanted to discuss with the appellant first. Steven also said that he would check with the appellant concerning other details.
The next day, PW5 talked to Ramesh and DW2 about the planned burglary. They were initially reluctant but eventually agreed to participate. Ramesh and DW2 were good friends of PW5. PW5`s evidence was that he told them that the appellant provided the information about the British Club.
A few days later, PW5 went to the appellant`s office. Steven was also present. The appellant told PW5 that there were no close-circuit television cameras inside the British Club. The appellant told him that the burglary would take place on 7 September 1992. Only the three of them were present at this meeting. I noted, however, that PW5 said in cross-examination at one stage that this was the first time he discussed the break-in at the British Club with Steven, though he subsequently reverted to his original position.
After this meeting, PW5 kept in constant touch with Steven, who supplied implements such as false number plates for a van, a crow-bar, a cutter and a few screwdrivers. Steven told PW5 to meet him between 7pm and 8pm at Lorong Ampas. PW5 obtained the vehicle used in the burglary because Steven was unable to do so. However, Steven backed out at the last minute and told them that his cousin, Veera, would take his place. PW5 telephoned the appellant to ask about this, and was told that all would go on as planned, just as Steven had said.
PW5 described in detail the break-in. In a nutshell, PW5, Ramesh, DW2 and Veera made off with a large quantity of coins from the British Club`s jackpot machines. They drove to Jalan Ampas, where DW2`s father worked, and deposited the stolen coins in a small room at the back of the building. Their intention was to wait for Steven`s instructions.
PW5 contacted Steven the next day. Steven said that he would call the appellant and let PW5 know what to do. Later, Steven called and said that he would be there in the evening to help them count the coins. PW5 telephoned the appellant and told him what Steven said. The appellant said that he knew about this and that he would be there as well.
Ramesh and DW2 arrived at about 5pm that evening. The appellant came later in a taxi. However, Steven did not turn up. The four of them started to count the coins but gave up because there were too many. Instead, they packed them in `Ziploc` bags and divided the bags. The appellant took two bags of one dollar coins and told them that Steven would be coming later to collect his and Veera`s share.
The next day, PW5 telephoned the appellant and asked why Steven had not collected the money. The appellant reassured PW5 that nothing would go wrong. The appellant also asked PW5 not to implicate him if something was to go wrong. PW5 agreed. He related this to Ramesh and DW2. They too agreed not to implicate the appellant.
Steven did not collect his money, so PW5 told DW2 and Ramesh that they would set aside Steven`s and Veera`s share, and that they could take theirs. Ramesh was later arrested, apparently because he got into an argument with a taxi-driver. The next day, PW5 was arrested.
The investigating officer gave evidence that Steven is deceased. Steven had been arrested in 1992 but had not been charged for the British Club break-in. It was not possible to ascertain the reason for this, because the investigating officer for that case had also passed away. All that could be said was that Steven had been charged with and was convicted of another offence. A British Club representative testified that the British Club did not have any close-circuit television cameras in September 1992.
 The defence
The appellant`s defence was a denial. His evidence was that there was one occasion before 7 September 1992 when Steven met PW5 at the appellant`s workplace. Steven`s father worked nearby and PW5 used to go to the appellant`s workplace for drinks. The appellant introduced Steven to PW5. The appellant said that he overheard the two of them talking about the British Club when he returned from his rounds. He did not know what the discussion was about.
Sometime around 7 September 1992, the appellant received a call from Steven. Steven asked him to go to a coffee shop at Balestier Road. Steven said that he wanted to talk to the appellant. The appellant asked him what it was about, but Steven said that he could not talk about it over the phone.
The appellant took a taxi to the coffee-shop. Steven and PW5 were there, together with another man whom he could not recall. They had some food and beer. Then the appellant asked Steven why he asked him to go there. Steven and PW5 took him to a small room in a building opposite the coffee-shop. There were coins heaped on the floor. Steven asked the appellant if he could help to change the coins to notes. The appellant replied that they could be changed at the bank and told him not to call the appellant again at his workplace.
The appellant denied instigating PW5 to commit the housebreaking. He denied providing information about the British Club, planning the housebreaking or taking any of the money. He also did not know Ramesh, DW2 or Veera. He did not know why PW5 implicated him.
DW2 had served his sentence for the British Club break-in. He testified that he was never told by PW5 of the appellant`s involvement in the break-in. PW5 had merely told him that PW5, Steven, Ramesh and himself were involved. DW2 did not know Steven until PW5 introduced him to DW2. DW2 did not speak to Steven. PW5 only told him that Steven planned the break-in. PW5 never said anything about the appellant.
DW2 had only seen the appellant once at Lorong Ampas. This was after the break-in. He did not notice whether the appellant took any money when he left. He did not know what was discussed as they were speaking in Tamil. DW2 had not seen the appellant again.
During cross-examination, DW2 confirmed that the agreement was that they would share the money from the break-in equally. He was not sure whether the appellant was involved in counting the coins. The appellant merely volunteered to change the coins. DW2 also explained that he might have said to the investigating officer on 10 June 1996 that the appellant was present and gave information on how to execute the plan for the break-in because it was not clear in his mind who Steven and the appellant were at the time. He had thought that the appellant was Steven and vice versa. It was only in court that he saw that the appellant was not Steven. It had been a very long time since he last saw them.
 The finding below
The district judge was aware that for the purpose of this trial, PW5 was an accomplice. However, the district judge was satisified that PW5 was a truthful witness. He held:
 
When [PW5] testified I observed his demeanour closely particularly during the cross-examination. His account of the facts and surrounding circumstances relating to the break-in at the British Club was clear and consistent. He was unshaken in cross-examination. There was no reason for the court to disbelieve his testimony when he had already served sentence for the British Club break-in and he gained nothing from testifying against the accused. The defence also did not suggest any motive on the part of [PW5] for his testimony.
 
 
 
The district judge was of the view that there was corroboration of PW5`s evidence that the appellant had told him that there was no close-circuit television cameras at the British Club. The district judge accepted PW5`s explanation for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in. He held:
 
However [PW5] explained that the mistake was due to a confusion whilst being interrogated. He however promptly rectified his mistake and the accused was not charged in connection with the Leksun robbery. I accepted this as an honest mistake.
 
 
 
The district judge had no difficulty in accepting PW5`s evidence that he was easing his conscience by informing the police about the appellant`s involvement.
On the other hand, the district judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence. It was difficult for him to believe that Steven and PW5 would hatch a plot to burgle the British Club upon being introduced. It was also difficult for him to believe that the appellant would leave his post and take a taxi at his expense to Jalan Ampas at Steven`s request just to be shown coins and to be consulted on whether the appellant could help to change them into notes. He was of the view that the fact that the appellant rushed down from his place of work showed his involvement in the robbery. Furthermore, DW2 had said that the appellant volunteered to change the coins, whilst the appellant said that he had told them to go to the bank.
As for DW2`s evidence, it did not assist the appellant. That Steven told PW5 of the location of the break-in did not exonerate the appellant from being a planner. In any case, DW2 appeared to the district judge to be a reluctant witness.
In the event, the district judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. He convicted the appellant and sentenced him to four years` imprisonment.
 The appeal
For this appeal, I constantly bore in mind the fact that the conviction was based solely on the testimony of PW5, an accomplice. In this context, s 116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) must be given real effect, and not merely recited. I also kept in mind the fact that PW5 had not in any manner implicated the appellant when he pleaded guilty to the offence in 1992. In addition, he had also wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in, which occurred in 1996, before he implicated the appellant in the British Club break-in.
The district judge was of the view that PW5`s testimony was unshaken by cross-examination. With respect to the district judge, it was not altogether clear what the district judge meant by this. If he meant that PW5 had not retracted his evidence, that was obviously too much to ask for. If he meant that PW5`s evidence withstood cross-examination, then I disagreed.
Firstly, PW5 had not given any credible explanation as to why he had wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in. His answer was a convenient `I was confused`. There was no explanation proffered as to how and why he was confused. PW5 had just been released from prison after serving terms for, inter alia, the British Club break-in. He was arrested for the Leksun break-in, which occurred some four years later after his release from prison. According to him, he was also being interrogated in relation to seven other charges. However, the fact remained that the Leksun break-in was committed by PW5 the day before his arrest. I was unable to fathom how he could be confused to the extent of accusing the appellant of being involved in it.
The emptiness of PW5`s evidence that he was confused could be compared vividly with DW2`s explanation of how DW2 was confused. DW2 accepted that he might have told the investigating officer in 1996 that the appellant planned the British Club break-in. His explanation of this was cogent. He had only met the appellant once, and that was four years ago. Likewise, he had not seen Steven for four years. He had thought that the appellant was Steven. That was why he corrected himself when he saw in court that the appellant was not Steven. It was a reasonable and acceptable explanation. PW5`s explanation, on the other hand, was bereft of content.
The bareness of PW5`s explanation also raised numerous doubts. Many questions remain unanswered. In what context did PW5 first mention the appellant? How did it come about that he mentioned the appellant? If the interrogation was sufficiently vigorous for PW5 to be so fundamentally confused, how reliable could what he said be?
Contrary to what the district judge said, there did not appear to be any indication at all in the records that the appellant was not charged with the Leksun break-in because PW5 corrected himself. It appeared just as likely that the appellant was not charged because further investigation revealed that the accusation was false. It was a crucial distinction whether PW5 corrected himself, if at all, before or after investigations revealed that the appellant was not involved in the Leksun break-in. The two alternatives would throw very different light on the complexion of the whole case. In the latter scenario, there would be very plausible reasons why PW5 would want to implicate the appellant falsely, namely, that his initial lie was found out. It cannot be over-emphasised that PW5 had wrongly or falsely implicated the appellant on the very day of his arrest.
Secondly, regarding PW5`s reason for implicating the appellant now, some four years later, PW5 said that this was to ease his conscience. With respect to the district judge, considering that PW5 was a person who embarked on a series of housebreaking so soon after his release from prison, his claim of being conscience-stricken sounded empty. PW5`s evidence appeared to be that if he had not been arrested again, he would not have been bothered by his conscience!
I was of the view PW5`s statement that `it is not fair` gave a better insight into the state of his mind at the relevant time. It revealed his desire that the appellant should be imprisoned. As for what was not fair, it may be that it was as the appellant said, that it was because the appellant was never punished even though he was the mastermind of the British Club break-in. On the other hand, it could be anything else. Whatever it was, it seemed that it was only unfair because the appellant was arrested for the Leksun break-in. In my view, it was very dangerous to rely on his testimony.
Thirdly, PW5`s evidence was not wholly consistent. He had said in examination-in-chief that after the appellant instigated him to commit the break-in over the phone, Steven went to PW5`s workplace and they discussed about the planned break-in. Subsequently, they went to the appellant`s workplace where they again discussed the break-in. However, in his cross-examination, PW5 said that the first time he discussed the break-in with Steven was at the appellant`s workplace. This was a material contradiction. This is because PW5`s evidence was that the appellant told PW5 that he would send Steven over to see PW5 to discuss the details of the planned break-in.
More importantly, PW5`s evidence was not consistent at all with DW2`s. In this context, it was highly relevant that DW2 and PW5 were friends. On the other hand, DW2 hardly knew the appellant at all. If it was the case that PW5 had finally decided to bare all about the appellant`s involvement, there was little reason for DW2 to be a `reluctant witness`. If PW5 was to be believed, the reason why DW2 did not implicate the appellant was because PW5 asked him not to. That reason no longer existed.
In any event, considering that the agreement was that the participants share the spoils equally, it seemed highly improbable that PW5 would not have told Rameesh and DW2 that there was an additional person who would be sharing the loot. This would be so no matter how disinterested DW2 could have been in the details of the planned break-in. The contrary position, which even PW5 did not suggest in his evidence, would have bordered on the inherently incredible.
Looked at in this light, DW2`s evidence that the appellant had volunteered to change the coins into notes paled into insignificance compared to his evidence on the bigger picture of his lack of knowledge that the appellant was involved in the break-in. The former was at best a minor inconsistency. The latter was a material contradiction.
Counsel for the defence had, undoubtedly, conceded that DW2`s evidence was neither here nor there. However, bearing in mind what I have said about his evidence, I was of the firm view that this concession was wrongly made. Despite the unsatisfactory state of DW2`s evidence, the major points in his testimony were most telling. The district judge ought to have examined them more carefully.
Lastly, I found it difficult to understand how the British Club representative`s evidence could be corroboration of any part of PW5`s evidence, apart from the fact that PW5 knew that there was no close-circuit television at the club. PW5 could have acquired that knowledge from any person. There was also no explanation as to how the appellant came to know so much about the British Club.
It is settled law that when a trial judge makes a finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb the finding. Reference may be made to 
Teo Ai Choo v Leng Sze Hian
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 331
  ; 
[1986] SLR 75
 and 
PP v Victor Rajoo s/o A Pitchay Muthu
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
  .
However, it is equally settled law that an impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. This salutory caution was stated by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
Tara Sing& Ors v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  . That case was approved in 
PP v Yeoh Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
  , and by the Court of Appeal in 
 PP v Victor Rajoo 
. Likewise, a finding on a witness`s credibility must be tested against known objective facts and evidence.
For the reasons I have stated, it cannot be said that PW5`s evidence was so compelling that a conviction could be based solely on it. The circumstance in which he came to implicate the appellant was suspect, as was his motive. His evidence was neither consistent, nor did it square with the account given by his accomplice, DW2. In this context, if PW5 had no reason to lie, DW2 had even less reason to do so. There were important gaps in the prosecution`s case. Tested against the whole of his evidence, and the known objective facts and evidence, PW5`s testimony fell far short.
Turning to the appellant`s defence, it is also trite law that an accused should not be convicted merely because his defence is tenuous or because the trial judge disbelieves his defence. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will deal with the district judge`s findings on this. In my view, the district judge appeared to have misconstrued the appellant`s evidence on at least two material instances.
Firstly, it was never the appellant`s evidence that PW5 and Steven hatched a plan to break into the British Club when they first met at the appellant`s workplace. The appellant`s evidence was that he overheard them talking about the British Club. This was a completely different thing from saying that they were discussing how to break into the British Club. No doubt, counsel for the appellant had put to PW5 that PW5 and Steven discussed the British Club break-in on that occasion, but that was hardly the same thing as the appellant`s testimony. By the same token, the prosecuting officer had put to DW2 that DW2, PW5, the appellant, Steven and Ramesh held discussions prior to the British Club break-in, even though it was never PW5`s evidence that such a discussion involving so many persons ever took place before the break-in.
In any event, even if this part of the appellant`s evidence was untrue, and the appellant never overheard them talking about the British Club, it still did not take the prosecution`s case very far. The appellant`s recollection of when the meeting took place was unlikely to be reliable. The appellant was describing an event that took place four years ago.
Secondly, it was not the appellant`s evidence that he took a taxi from work to see Steven just to be asked whether he could change coins into notes. His evidence was that Steven asked him to meet him and that it concerned something that should not be discussed over the phone. It seemed to me that to any reasonable person, this amounted to saying that it was something important, which would have justified the appellant leaving work and taking a taxi to meet Steven. Likewise, I was unable to see anything peculiar about Steven`s request that the appellant meet him.
In addition, there was hardly any reason for the appellant to have rushed down to the coffee shop if what PW5 said was true. The break-in had occurred the previous night, and according to PW5, the appellant was informed the following morning. The appellant only went to the coffee shop near Jalan Ampas in the evening.
In conclusion, even though I did not have the benefit of assessing PW5`s demeanor, I was satisfied that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction. The conviction was unsafe. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.",16/5/1997 0:00,SG High Court

Damien John Simpson (the accused) appeals against an order of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania 
    [1]
   which dismissed his appeal against a conviction for murder. He contends that his conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the Crown failed to tender any evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that he killed the deceased ""by means of [an] unlawful act  which [he] knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances""
                     
    [2]
  . Alternatively, he contends that the conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the circumstances that could be taken into account in determining whether the accused ought to have known that his act was likely to cause death. He also contends that the judge's directions to the jury effectively reversed the onus of proof as to those circumstances.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 13 November 1996).

                           
Criminal Code Act 1924 
                           Tas, s 157(1)(c).



               

The charge of murder was laid under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code Act 1924 
                     Tas (the Criminal Code). That paragraph provides:Subject to the provisions of section 160, culpable homicide is murder if it is committed â€”
                           
                           
(c) by means of any unlawful act or omission which the offender knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances, although he had no wish to cause death or bodily harm to any person.

                           
                        

                     

                  


               

The accused was tried before a judge and a jury of twelve in the Supreme Court of Tasmania 
    [3]
  . At the trial, the Crown tendered evidence that in June 1995, the accused killed Anthony William Smith by stabbing him in the neck with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade. From the evidence, the jury was entitled to conclude that, after an altercation had started between two groups, the accused ran across the road to the footpath and struck the deceased who was a member of one of the groups. Friends of the accused were in the other group. None of the eye witnesses saw the accused with a knife. One eye witness said that the accused ""just raised his hand and it looked like he had hit one of the fellows""; another said that the accused ""brought it down as in a hitting motion like he punched him"". But in a record of interview and in his evidence the accused admitted that he had stabbed the deceased with the knife. Medical evidence established that the deceased had been stabbed in the left side of the neck just above the collarbone. The entry wound measured 7.8 cm by 1.8 cm and was deep enough to cut one of the major branches of the aorta and pierce the upper part of the left lung.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 6 December 1995).



               

The accused's record of interview contained the following admission:Are you able to tell me where you stabbed the man?No I wouldn't have a clue. I know it was on the upper part of the bo [sic], body though.
                     

                  


               

Later in the interview, the accused was asked:Did you, you said that you st, you st, [sic] you stabbed him in the upper part of the body?Yeah.
                        
And you realised that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em?
                        
Not if it's in the arm.
                        
I'm talkin [sic] about the upper body not the arms.
                        
I, yeah I did realise but I, I thought that it was probably around this area sort of, like from the arm to here. So I wasn't, I wasn't sure where I hit him, stabbed him at all.
                     
While describing ""this area sort of, like from the arm to here"", the accused pointed to an area just below the neck running across the chest from arm to arm.

               

In evidence, the accused claimed, as he had during his record of interview, that he killed the deceased in self-defence. He said that he crossed the road in the direction that his father and some friends had gone and that, when he got to the footpath, the deceased pushed him in the chest. The accused said, ""I freaked out. I pulled me knife out. It hit this young man."" He explained that by ""freaked out"" he meant that he ""was scared because [the deceased] was pushing me"" and that he was frightened that he ""was going to get beaten up"". The accused said in evidence that he had no medical training, knew nothing about medicine, and had not heard of the ""subclavium artery"". Under cross-examination, he admitted that he knew that ""in the upper part of the body between the heart and the face there are lots of arteries that carry blood"" and that ""blood vessels are going from the heart to various parts of the body  taking blood around"".

               

The trial judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence that the accused knew ""that what he was doing was likely to cause death"". That being so, the accused contends that he should not have been found guilty of murder because the Crown failed to tender evidence of circumstances from which the conclusion could be drawn that he ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause the death of the deceased. The accused contends that, when the Crown relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) to prove a charge of murder, the prosecution must fail unless the Crown establishes that the accused knew all the relevant facts which are relied on to give rise to the inference that he or she ought to have known that the unlawful act was likely to cause death. The accused argued that a charge under that limb of s 157(1)(c) is not proved if no more is shown than that ordinary persons â€” even ordinary twenty-one year old persons â€” know that the unlawful act was one that was likely to cause death.

   establishes that, when the prosecution relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c), the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, and not some hypothetical person, ought to have known, if he or she had thought about it, that there was ""a ""real and not remote"" chance""
                     
    [5]
   that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased 
    [6]
  . That is to say, on the proven facts, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this accused with his or her knowledge ought to have known that there was a real chance that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased. In Boughey 
                     
    [7]
  , Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ, who gave the leading judgment, said that ""the content of the knowledge laid at the door of an accused is [not] to be assessed by reference to the notional knowledge and capacity of some hypothetical person"". Their Honours went on to say that what was relevant for the purpose of the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) was ""the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""

Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

Counsel for the accused contended that the principles laid down in Boughey  led to the conclusion that there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that the accused ought to have known that his act might kill the deceased. He contended that ""without evidence of the particular expertise"" of the accused, the jury could only apply an objective test which ""was impermissible under Boughey 
                     "". But nothing in that case requires the conclusion that a prosecution under the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) must fail unless the Crown proves the state of the accused's knowledge or ""expertise"" by direct evidence.

               

The issue in Boughey  was whether the trial judge had misdirected the jury by referring to the extent that the medical training and experience of the accused should have alerted him ""to the dangers of applying carotid artery pressure"" and ""to the desirability of studying medical literature in order to acquaint himself with the dangers, if any, of such a practice""
                     
    [9]
  . Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said 
    [10]
   that the trial judge's ""remarks about the desirability of studying medical literature would  have been mistaken if they meant that there was to be imputed to the [accused] the knowledge which he would have acquired if he had stopped to study such literature"". However, they held that, read in the context of a long summing up, the ""somewhat ambiguous remark"" of the trial judge had not diverted the jury from examining the accused's actual knowledge as opposed to knowledge that could be imputed to him from the medical literature.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.

                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29.



               

It was in that context that their Honours said that the starting point in the inquiry whether the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause death ""must be the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""
                     
    [11]
   Nothing in that passage or in the decision itself gives any support for the notion that the Crown cannot prove the accused's knowledge inferentially or that the prosecution must fail unless the Crown directly proves the knowledge and expertise of the accused concerning the relevant circumstances.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

The accused's knowledge of or ""expertise"" concerning those circumstances may be proved by his or her own evidence, by out-of-court-admissions or by inference. If the Crown relies on inference to prove that the accused knew the relevant circumstances, the Crown may establish the inference by proving other facts that make it logical to infer that the accused knew the circumstances. If the charge is that the accused ought to have known that defective premises were likely to cause death to those entering them, it may be sufficient to prove that the defect was obvious and that the accused had visited the premises regularly even though the Crown is unable to prove by direct evidence or admission that the accused was aware of the defects in the premises.

               

Moreover, knowledge of the circumstances may often be inferred without proof of additional facts. Some or all of the circumstances may be so well known in a community or to a section of the community of which the accused is a member that it is open to a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew of those circumstances. If a fact or circumstance is so well known that no reasonable person in the section or community would dispute it, a jury may safely infer that the accused knew it unless any denial by him raises a reasonable doubt about his or her knowledge. What facts or circumstances fall into this category will vary from one era to another and from one community to another. The category of such facts and circumstances will be as wide as the common experience of the relevant community of which the accused is a member and will expand as the frontiers of that community's general knowledge expands.

               

No doubt the category is narrower than the list of matters of which a court can take judicial notice. A judge called on to take judicial notice of a fact may have regard to any fact or matter that is within the knowledge of ""every well-informed person in Australia""
                     
    [12]
  . Furthermore, in an appropriate case, the judge may cause ""inquiries to be made by himself for his own information from sources to which it is proper for him to refer""
                     
    [13]
  . When the issue is whether, in the absence of direct evidence, the jury can infer that the accused knew a particular fact or circumstance, however, the relevant community is that to which the accused belongs. The relevant knowledge of that community may be narrower or wider than that of well informed persons in Australia. If the accused is a doctor, for example, and the charge poses a medical issue, the Crown may prove the accused's knowledge by proving a fact or circumstance which no qualified practitioner could reasonably dispute. On the other hand, if the accused is a poorly educated youth in a remote area, the relevant body of knowledge will be that of youths of that class and may be much narrower than that of the general community.

Commonwealth Shipping Representative v Peninsular & Oriental Branch Service [1923] AC 191 at 212, per Lord Sumner.



               

The present case is concerned with the accused's knowledge of the likely result of stabbing a person with a knife. The consequences of using many common objects and substances are widely known in the Australian community. That guns kill, that acid burns, that flame ignites household gas and that driving on the wrong side of a road is likely to cause a collision, for example, are matters so well known in the Australian community that a jury can safely infer that the accused knew about such matters when they are relevant to a charge under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. Ordinary members of that community are also well aware of the consequences that can follow from most uses of knives, fire, gas, electricity and explosives. In cases where the accused has caused the death of a person by using such an object or substance, it will usually be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to infer that the accused knew what could follow from its use.

               

In the present case, the jury could find that the accused intended to stab the deceased somewhere in the upper chest area close to the neck and that he wielded the knife with considerable force. The question which then arises is whether the jury could reasonably find that the accused ought to have known that there was a real chance that his assault might cause the death of the deceased. That depends on whether he knew that forcefully stabbing a person in the upper chest area with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade might lead to the death of that person.

               

The accused was aged twenty-one when the events occurred. Nothing in the evidence indicated that he had less knowledge than other persons of his age concerning the consequences of stabbing a person in the upper chest area. That being so, the jury were entitled to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that there was a real chance that plunging a knife into the upper chest area of a person might lead to death. From an early age, Australian children learn from films, television, comics, books and newspapers that stabbing a person in the stomach, chest, back or neck is likely to kill that person if the knife blade is sharp and long enough and wielded with sufficient force. They may not know why or how the knife blade causes death although no doubt many of them know from an early age that a stabbing will cause bleeding. But they do know that stabbing a person in the neck or body is almost as likely to result in death as shooting a person in those areas. In evidence, the accused did not assert that he knew nothing about the potential consequences of stabbing a person in the upper body. Indeed, he conceded in his record of interview that he ""did realise"" 
                     ""that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em"" (emphasis added). Even if the accused's admission is read as confined to stabbing a person in the neck, it was evidence from which the jury could find that he ought to have known that attempting to stab the deceased in the upper body area might lead to that person's death, if by chance or misadventure the knife went into his neck.

               

Given that it was open to the jury to find that the accused knew that stabbing somebody in the neck might kill that person, it necessarily follows that it was also open to them to find that the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act could cause death. The question for the jury under the ""ought to have known"" limb was not whether the accused intended to kill the deceased or stab him in the neck. Nor was it whether the accused knew that the knife might transect one of the major branches of the aorta. It was whether the accused, if he ""had stopped to think to the extent that he ought to have""
                     
    [14]
  , would have realised that stabbing the deceased with this knife in the general area of the upper body gave rise to a real chance that the stabbing would kill the deceased. The jury could reasonably find that, if the accused had thought about the matter, he would have realised that there was a real chance that, by bringing this knife down in the manner and in the direction that he did, the blade would enter the upper body of the deceased in or near the neck and inflict a fatal wound.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.



               

Moreover, in determining what the accused knew, the jury were entitled to, and no doubt did, act on the basis that an ordinary twenty-one year old person knows that, if he or she forcefully stabs a person in the upper body with a knife that has a 7 cm blade, there is a real chance that it will kill that person. Independently of the accused's admission that he did realise that stabbing somebody ""in that part of the body"" might kill the person, the jury were entitled to think that the chance that the accused did not know what an ordinary twenty-one year old knows was so remote that it could be safely disregarded. Consequently, even if the accused had made no admission, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that he ought to have known that his unlawful act gave rise to a real chance that it might cause the death of the deceased.

               
                  
Misdirection
                  

Alternatively, the accused contended that, even if the admissions made by him in his record of interview were evidence ""as to [his] subjective state of mind"", ""the learned trial judge had a duty to warn the jury in the strongest possible terms that this evidence was not at all cogent in terms of its capacity to establish that state of mind in the subjective sense required by Boughey 
                        "". He also contended that the trial judge had a duty ""to ensure that the jury did not lapse into a review conducted in an objective manner"".

                  

In summing up to the jury on the ""ought to have known"" issue, the trial judge said:In what circumstances should a person have known that his act was likely to cause death. You have to consider this from the position of Mr Simpson, the accused. We're not talking about what some hypothetical person ought to have known or what you would have known, the question is what he ought to have known. So with his actual state of knowledge, his age, which is twenty-one, we don't know much about him really we haven't really been told much about him. But you've heard him in the witness box you might be able to make some assessment of him and you've seen him on that video of course. But with his actual state of knowledge and capacity as you determine the[m] to have been, then you look at the circumstances he was placed in and you determine, you make a judgment and determine ought he to have known that his unlawful act, if there was one, was likely to cause death, even if he didn't want to cause it. You should consider had he stopped to think to the extent that you think he should have, would he have known or appreciated that death was likely to ensue from his act. I'll put it another way, to what extent do you consider that he ought to have stopped to think and if he had done so, would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result. Now that's what ought to have known involves. And let me go to the next bit, ought to have known that it was likely to cause death. The expression ""likely to cause death"" is one you can probably understand but you might have difficulty defining it if you had to. However, it's something, if something is likely to happen or there is a good chance that it will happen it probably means the same thing. It is something that may well happen, you might say it may not happen, but there is a good chance that it will happen. It's likely to happen, these are all similar expressions. So likely to cause death is an ordinary expression which is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real chance as distinct from what is a mere possibility. A good chance that it will happen, something that may well happen, something that is likely to happen, but not just a mere possibility. Now I hope that helps you but look at the words that are used in the memorandum ""likely"" is the word that's used there. So did he know that death was likely to be caused or ought he to have known that death was likely to be caused by his act. That's the question for you. It's a question of fact for the Jury to determine.
                     


                  

The learned judge gave the jury no directions as to how they might determine the accused's state of knowledge; nor did he refer in terms to the admissions of the accused. However, his Honour was under no obligation to give such directions, and counsel for the accused at the trial sought no directions at the conclusion of the summing up. That being so, his Honour's directions cannot be faulted. There is no reason to think that the jury applied an objective test or that the directions permitted ""the onus of proof to shift away from the Crown in respect to proving circumstances peculiar to the [accused] sufficient to allow a jury to find a subjective state of mind in the [accused]"". Nor is there any reason to suppose that the trial miscarried in any way.

                  

His Honour made it clear to the jury that they had to consider the ""ought to have known"" issue ""from the position of  the accused"" and that it was his ""actual state of knowledge"" and not that of ""some hypothetical person"" that was relevant. The learned judge also told the jury that they had to consider that, if the accused had stopped to think about the matter ""would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result"". Given these directions, there is no ground for thinking that the jury would have applied an objective test in determining whether the accused ""ought to have known"" that death was the likely result of his unlawful act.

Kirby and Callinan JJ.
               

Mr Damien John Simpson (the appellant) appeals against the order of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal dismissing his appeal against his conviction for murder. The victim, Mr Tony Smith, died of a single stab wound inflicted in his neck by the appellant.

               
                  
Background facts and admissions to the police
                  

The appellant, a man of twenty-one years at the time of the offence, spent about three hours in the evening of 10 June 1995 at an hotel in Launceston drinking beer and some whiskey. At about half past midnight, he left the hotel in company with five other people, including his father, to walk into the city. On the way, three men accosted one of the appellant's party, Mr Ivan Quarrell, and asked for a cigarette. In a police interview which was recorded on videotape and which commenced some seven or so hours after the events to be described, the appellant gave this account of what occurred:Um, Ivan was talkin to some blokes, three blokes an um, they asked for a cigarette, an Ivan gave em a cigarette and then we walked across the road an Ivan said that um he took me cigarettes, so me father went down across the road an um asked for the cigarettes and they were bein real smart an um  then I ran, then I ran across the road to where me father was an then they started, this bloke started pushin me around and then um first thing I done was grab me knife, cos [he] was pushin me around.
                     


                  

A little later in the interview, the appellant enlarged upon that account:
                           

                              
Q Do you normally carry a knife, do you normally carry this knife all the time?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q And whereabouts did you have the knife?

                              
                              
A In my back pocket.

                              
                              
Q And was it open or was it closed when 
                              

                              
                              
A Yeah, it was closed.

                              
                              
Q Did you open it when you pulled it out of your pocket?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q After this fi , this fellow was pushing you around 
                              

                              
                              
A Mm.

                              
                              
Q 
                                  and you've opened your knife, knife up, what did you do then?

                              
                              
A I leaned, I was tryin ta when he was pushin me, I was, I, all that I done was pulled out me knife an then he pushed me again an then I went like that an then 
                              

                              
                              
Q When did you open it then?

                              
                              
A When it was in me pocket I just went like that an then it flipped open, like as soon as I pulled it out of me, out of me pocket.

                              
                              
Q And how many times did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A Once I think.

                              
                              
Q Whereabouts did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A I wouldn't have a clue.

                              
                              
Q Was he facing you?

                              
                              
A Yeah he was cos [he] was pushing me so, yeah he woulda been facing me.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

In the interview, the appellant was interrogated about his state of mind:
                           

                              
Q Why did you do it?

                              
                              
A Why, cos I was frightened.

                              
                              
Q Frightened of what?

                              
                              
A Because that bloke was pushin me, like cos I thought he was gunna punch me head in (sniff).

                              
                              
Q What was your intention when you pulled your knife out and opened it up?

                              
                              
A No intentions cos I didn't think, I just, I was just tryina get away sorta thing.

                              
                              
Q Well, at the time of pulling the knife out and opening up, did you intend to use the knife?

                              
                              
A Not real, nah. Well as, the split, it happened in a split second that's all I know.

                              
                              
                              
Q At the time that you pulled the knife out though did you intend to kill him?

                              
                              
A No I didn't. I didn't even intend to pull the knife out at all, I didn't, I didn't mean to stab him at all, just (sniff) somin that, it just happened.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

Later, the appellant said that he was scared of his victim who was a ""pretty big bloke"" and was pushing him around. He also expressly denied the investigating police officer's direct assertion that he had intended to stab the deceased. He claimed that he was fairly drunk at the time but admitted, at one point at least, that he knew what he was doing. The Crown called as witnesses, other members of the two groups and an independent witness, a taxi driver who had witnessed the events. There were various differences in their testimony. However, they were remarkably consistent with respect to their observations of how the fatal blow was inflicted by the appellant: that he ran up to the victim, either with his hand raised, or that he raised it when he reached the victim, to strike at him and then, ran away.

                  

The appellant gave evidence at his trial. No other evidence was called in his case. We do not read his evidence as being in substance any different from the account that he gave when he was interviewed by the investigating police officers. Although some of the witnesses' versions were vague, no doubt as a result, in part at least, of the consumption of alcohol, one matter was clear at the trial: that the appellant was not under any direct, serious, personal, physical threat before he struck the victim with his knife.

                  

At trial, the appellant relied on self-defence 
    [15]
  . Clearly this was rejected by the jury. No point now arises about that. Alternatively, the appellant submitted before the jury that, if the Crown had satisfied them that self-defence was negatived, the proper verdict in the circumstances was one of manslaughter. This was so on the ground that the appellant neither knew, nor ought to have known, that death was likely to result from his actions.
