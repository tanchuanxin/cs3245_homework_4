The appellant was convicted on a charge of abetting by instigation the commission of housebreaking and theft by night, contrary to s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with s 34. The persons the appellant were alleged to have abetted were Narendran s/o Govindaraj (PW5), Ramesh s/o Ramachandra (Ramesh), Suraj Babu s/o Mndraju (DW2), Selvam s/o Munusamy (also known as Veera) and one Subramaniam (Steven). The theft took place on 7 September 1992 at about 1am at the British Club. I will refer to this incident as the `British Club break-in`.
 The prosecution`s evidence
The prosecution relied solely on PW5`s testimony. PW5 is currently serving six years` corrective training for a series of offences. On 19 December 1992, he pleaded guilty to the British Club break-in, together with some other offences. He was, on that occasion, sentenced to a total of four years and four months` imprisonment. There was no mention of the appellant in the statement of facts which he admitted to on that occasion. In that statement of facts, he had agreed that the burglary was planned by Steven. PW5 said that he implicated the appellant in 1996 because he had `a guilty conscience` and that it `was not fair` that the appellant had escaped unpunished.
On 3 June 1996, PW5 was arrested by the police on suspicion of a housebreaking at a building known as the Leksun Industrial Building which occurred the previous day. He also implicated the appellant in that break-in, which I will refer to as the `Leksun break-in`. It was common ground that the appellant had nothing to do with that offence. The appellant was arrested on the same day as a result of PW5`s accusation. The only explanation PW5 proferred for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in was that he was confused because he faced seven other charges at the time.
PW5 first met the appellant sometime in the middle of 1992. The appellant was a security guard at BP Singapore Pte Ltd when PW5 started work there. A few days later, the appellant was transferred to another location. They kept in touch with each other over the phone.
According to PW5, the appellant telephoned him and asked him if he was interested in breaking into the British Club. The appellant gave him the details concerning the location of the British Club and what items could be found there. The appellant told PW5 that Steven would give him the details of how it was to be done. One or two days later, Steven went alone to PW5`s workplace. PW5 said that this was not the first time that he met Steven. They discussed the break-in in a taxi when they left. Steven suggested a date but said that he wanted to discuss with the appellant first. Steven also said that he would check with the appellant concerning other details.
The next day, PW5 talked to Ramesh and DW2 about the planned burglary. They were initially reluctant but eventually agreed to participate. Ramesh and DW2 were good friends of PW5. PW5`s evidence was that he told them that the appellant provided the information about the British Club.
A few days later, PW5 went to the appellant`s office. Steven was also present. The appellant told PW5 that there were no close-circuit television cameras inside the British Club. The appellant told him that the burglary would take place on 7 September 1992. Only the three of them were present at this meeting. I noted, however, that PW5 said in cross-examination at one stage that this was the first time he discussed the break-in at the British Club with Steven, though he subsequently reverted to his original position.
After this meeting, PW5 kept in constant touch with Steven, who supplied implements such as false number plates for a van, a crow-bar, a cutter and a few screwdrivers. Steven told PW5 to meet him between 7pm and 8pm at Lorong Ampas. PW5 obtained the vehicle used in the burglary because Steven was unable to do so. However, Steven backed out at the last minute and told them that his cousin, Veera, would take his place. PW5 telephoned the appellant to ask about this, and was told that all would go on as planned, just as Steven had said.
PW5 described in detail the break-in. In a nutshell, PW5, Ramesh, DW2 and Veera made off with a large quantity of coins from the British Club`s jackpot machines. They drove to Jalan Ampas, where DW2`s father worked, and deposited the stolen coins in a small room at the back of the building. Their intention was to wait for Steven`s instructions.
PW5 contacted Steven the next day. Steven said that he would call the appellant and let PW5 know what to do. Later, Steven called and said that he would be there in the evening to help them count the coins. PW5 telephoned the appellant and told him what Steven said. The appellant said that he knew about this and that he would be there as well.
Ramesh and DW2 arrived at about 5pm that evening. The appellant came later in a taxi. However, Steven did not turn up. The four of them started to count the coins but gave up because there were too many. Instead, they packed them in `Ziploc` bags and divided the bags. The appellant took two bags of one dollar coins and told them that Steven would be coming later to collect his and Veera`s share.
The next day, PW5 telephoned the appellant and asked why Steven had not collected the money. The appellant reassured PW5 that nothing would go wrong. The appellant also asked PW5 not to implicate him if something was to go wrong. PW5 agreed. He related this to Ramesh and DW2. They too agreed not to implicate the appellant.
Steven did not collect his money, so PW5 told DW2 and Ramesh that they would set aside Steven`s and Veera`s share, and that they could take theirs. Ramesh was later arrested, apparently because he got into an argument with a taxi-driver. The next day, PW5 was arrested.
The investigating officer gave evidence that Steven is deceased. Steven had been arrested in 1992 but had not been charged for the British Club break-in. It was not possible to ascertain the reason for this, because the investigating officer for that case had also passed away. All that could be said was that Steven had been charged with and was convicted of another offence. A British Club representative testified that the British Club did not have any close-circuit television cameras in September 1992.
 The defence
The appellant`s defence was a denial. His evidence was that there was one occasion before 7 September 1992 when Steven met PW5 at the appellant`s workplace. Steven`s father worked nearby and PW5 used to go to the appellant`s workplace for drinks. The appellant introduced Steven to PW5. The appellant said that he overheard the two of them talking about the British Club when he returned from his rounds. He did not know what the discussion was about.
Sometime around 7 September 1992, the appellant received a call from Steven. Steven asked him to go to a coffee shop at Balestier Road. Steven said that he wanted to talk to the appellant. The appellant asked him what it was about, but Steven said that he could not talk about it over the phone.
The appellant took a taxi to the coffee-shop. Steven and PW5 were there, together with another man whom he could not recall. They had some food and beer. Then the appellant asked Steven why he asked him to go there. Steven and PW5 took him to a small room in a building opposite the coffee-shop. There were coins heaped on the floor. Steven asked the appellant if he could help to change the coins to notes. The appellant replied that they could be changed at the bank and told him not to call the appellant again at his workplace.
The appellant denied instigating PW5 to commit the housebreaking. He denied providing information about the British Club, planning the housebreaking or taking any of the money. He also did not know Ramesh, DW2 or Veera. He did not know why PW5 implicated him.
DW2 had served his sentence for the British Club break-in. He testified that he was never told by PW5 of the appellant`s involvement in the break-in. PW5 had merely told him that PW5, Steven, Ramesh and himself were involved. DW2 did not know Steven until PW5 introduced him to DW2. DW2 did not speak to Steven. PW5 only told him that Steven planned the break-in. PW5 never said anything about the appellant.
DW2 had only seen the appellant once at Lorong Ampas. This was after the break-in. He did not notice whether the appellant took any money when he left. He did not know what was discussed as they were speaking in Tamil. DW2 had not seen the appellant again.
During cross-examination, DW2 confirmed that the agreement was that they would share the money from the break-in equally. He was not sure whether the appellant was involved in counting the coins. The appellant merely volunteered to change the coins. DW2 also explained that he might have said to the investigating officer on 10 June 1996 that the appellant was present and gave information on how to execute the plan for the break-in because it was not clear in his mind who Steven and the appellant were at the time. He had thought that the appellant was Steven and vice versa. It was only in court that he saw that the appellant was not Steven. It had been a very long time since he last saw them.
 The finding below
The district judge was aware that for the purpose of this trial, PW5 was an accomplice. However, the district judge was satisified that PW5 was a truthful witness. He held:
 
When [PW5] testified I observed his demeanour closely particularly during the cross-examination. His account of the facts and surrounding circumstances relating to the break-in at the British Club was clear and consistent. He was unshaken in cross-examination. There was no reason for the court to disbelieve his testimony when he had already served sentence for the British Club break-in and he gained nothing from testifying against the accused. The defence also did not suggest any motive on the part of [PW5] for his testimony.
 
 
 
The district judge was of the view that there was corroboration of PW5`s evidence that the appellant had told him that there was no close-circuit television cameras at the British Club. The district judge accepted PW5`s explanation for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in. He held:
 
However [PW5] explained that the mistake was due to a confusion whilst being interrogated. He however promptly rectified his mistake and the accused was not charged in connection with the Leksun robbery. I accepted this as an honest mistake.
 
 
 
The district judge had no difficulty in accepting PW5`s evidence that he was easing his conscience by informing the police about the appellant`s involvement.
On the other hand, the district judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence. It was difficult for him to believe that Steven and PW5 would hatch a plot to burgle the British Club upon being introduced. It was also difficult for him to believe that the appellant would leave his post and take a taxi at his expense to Jalan Ampas at Steven`s request just to be shown coins and to be consulted on whether the appellant could help to change them into notes. He was of the view that the fact that the appellant rushed down from his place of work showed his involvement in the robbery. Furthermore, DW2 had said that the appellant volunteered to change the coins, whilst the appellant said that he had told them to go to the bank.
As for DW2`s evidence, it did not assist the appellant. That Steven told PW5 of the location of the break-in did not exonerate the appellant from being a planner. In any case, DW2 appeared to the district judge to be a reluctant witness.
In the event, the district judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. He convicted the appellant and sentenced him to four years` imprisonment.
 The appeal
For this appeal, I constantly bore in mind the fact that the conviction was based solely on the testimony of PW5, an accomplice. In this context, s 116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) must be given real effect, and not merely recited. I also kept in mind the fact that PW5 had not in any manner implicated the appellant when he pleaded guilty to the offence in 1992. In addition, he had also wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in, which occurred in 1996, before he implicated the appellant in the British Club break-in.
The district judge was of the view that PW5`s testimony was unshaken by cross-examination. With respect to the district judge, it was not altogether clear what the district judge meant by this. If he meant that PW5 had not retracted his evidence, that was obviously too much to ask for. If he meant that PW5`s evidence withstood cross-examination, then I disagreed.
Firstly, PW5 had not given any credible explanation as to why he had wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in. His answer was a convenient `I was confused`. There was no explanation proffered as to how and why he was confused. PW5 had just been released from prison after serving terms for, inter alia, the British Club break-in. He was arrested for the Leksun break-in, which occurred some four years later after his release from prison. According to him, he was also being interrogated in relation to seven other charges. However, the fact remained that the Leksun break-in was committed by PW5 the day before his arrest. I was unable to fathom how he could be confused to the extent of accusing the appellant of being involved in it.
The emptiness of PW5`s evidence that he was confused could be compared vividly with DW2`s explanation of how DW2 was confused. DW2 accepted that he might have told the investigating officer in 1996 that the appellant planned the British Club break-in. His explanation of this was cogent. He had only met the appellant once, and that was four years ago. Likewise, he had not seen Steven for four years. He had thought that the appellant was Steven. That was why he corrected himself when he saw in court that the appellant was not Steven. It was a reasonable and acceptable explanation. PW5`s explanation, on the other hand, was bereft of content.
The bareness of PW5`s explanation also raised numerous doubts. Many questions remain unanswered. In what context did PW5 first mention the appellant? How did it come about that he mentioned the appellant? If the interrogation was sufficiently vigorous for PW5 to be so fundamentally confused, how reliable could what he said be?
Contrary to what the district judge said, there did not appear to be any indication at all in the records that the appellant was not charged with the Leksun break-in because PW5 corrected himself. It appeared just as likely that the appellant was not charged because further investigation revealed that the accusation was false. It was a crucial distinction whether PW5 corrected himself, if at all, before or after investigations revealed that the appellant was not involved in the Leksun break-in. The two alternatives would throw very different light on the complexion of the whole case. In the latter scenario, there would be very plausible reasons why PW5 would want to implicate the appellant falsely, namely, that his initial lie was found out. It cannot be over-emphasised that PW5 had wrongly or falsely implicated the appellant on the very day of his arrest.
Secondly, regarding PW5`s reason for implicating the appellant now, some four years later, PW5 said that this was to ease his conscience. With respect to the district judge, considering that PW5 was a person who embarked on a series of housebreaking so soon after his release from prison, his claim of being conscience-stricken sounded empty. PW5`s evidence appeared to be that if he had not been arrested again, he would not have been bothered by his conscience!
I was of the view PW5`s statement that `it is not fair` gave a better insight into the state of his mind at the relevant time. It revealed his desire that the appellant should be imprisoned. As for what was not fair, it may be that it was as the appellant said, that it was because the appellant was never punished even though he was the mastermind of the British Club break-in. On the other hand, it could be anything else. Whatever it was, it seemed that it was only unfair because the appellant was arrested for the Leksun break-in. In my view, it was very dangerous to rely on his testimony.
Thirdly, PW5`s evidence was not wholly consistent. He had said in examination-in-chief that after the appellant instigated him to commit the break-in over the phone, Steven went to PW5`s workplace and they discussed about the planned break-in. Subsequently, they went to the appellant`s workplace where they again discussed the break-in. However, in his cross-examination, PW5 said that the first time he discussed the break-in with Steven was at the appellant`s workplace. This was a material contradiction. This is because PW5`s evidence was that the appellant told PW5 that he would send Steven over to see PW5 to discuss the details of the planned break-in.
More importantly, PW5`s evidence was not consistent at all with DW2`s. In this context, it was highly relevant that DW2 and PW5 were friends. On the other hand, DW2 hardly knew the appellant at all. If it was the case that PW5 had finally decided to bare all about the appellant`s involvement, there was little reason for DW2 to be a `reluctant witness`. If PW5 was to be believed, the reason why DW2 did not implicate the appellant was because PW5 asked him not to. That reason no longer existed.
In any event, considering that the agreement was that the participants share the spoils equally, it seemed highly improbable that PW5 would not have told Rameesh and DW2 that there was an additional person who would be sharing the loot. This would be so no matter how disinterested DW2 could have been in the details of the planned break-in. The contrary position, which even PW5 did not suggest in his evidence, would have bordered on the inherently incredible.
Looked at in this light, DW2`s evidence that the appellant had volunteered to change the coins into notes paled into insignificance compared to his evidence on the bigger picture of his lack of knowledge that the appellant was involved in the break-in. The former was at best a minor inconsistency. The latter was a material contradiction.
Counsel for the defence had, undoubtedly, conceded that DW2`s evidence was neither here nor there. However, bearing in mind what I have said about his evidence, I was of the firm view that this concession was wrongly made. Despite the unsatisfactory state of DW2`s evidence, the major points in his testimony were most telling. The district judge ought to have examined them more carefully.
Lastly, I found it difficult to understand how the British Club representative`s evidence could be corroboration of any part of PW5`s evidence, apart from the fact that PW5 knew that there was no close-circuit television at the club. PW5 could have acquired that knowledge from any person. There was also no explanation as to how the appellant came to know so much about the British Club.
It is settled law that when a trial judge makes a finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb the finding. Reference may be made to 
Teo Ai Choo v Leng Sze Hian
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 331
  ; 
[1986] SLR 75
 and 
PP v Victor Rajoo s/o A Pitchay Muthu
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
  .
However, it is equally settled law that an impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. This salutory caution was stated by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
Tara Sing& Ors v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  . That case was approved in 
PP v Yeoh Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
  , and by the Court of Appeal in 
 PP v Victor Rajoo 
. Likewise, a finding on a witness`s credibility must be tested against known objective facts and evidence.
For the reasons I have stated, it cannot be said that PW5`s evidence was so compelling that a conviction could be based solely on it. The circumstance in which he came to implicate the appellant was suspect, as was his motive. His evidence was neither consistent, nor did it square with the account given by his accomplice, DW2. In this context, if PW5 had no reason to lie, DW2 had even less reason to do so. There were important gaps in the prosecution`s case. Tested against the whole of his evidence, and the known objective facts and evidence, PW5`s testimony fell far short.
Turning to the appellant`s defence, it is also trite law that an accused should not be convicted merely because his defence is tenuous or because the trial judge disbelieves his defence. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will deal with the district judge`s findings on this. In my view, the district judge appeared to have misconstrued the appellant`s evidence on at least two material instances.
Firstly, it was never the appellant`s evidence that PW5 and Steven hatched a plan to break into the British Club when they first met at the appellant`s workplace. The appellant`s evidence was that he overheard them talking about the British Club. This was a completely different thing from saying that they were discussing how to break into the British Club. No doubt, counsel for the appellant had put to PW5 that PW5 and Steven discussed the British Club break-in on that occasion, but that was hardly the same thing as the appellant`s testimony. By the same token, the prosecuting officer had put to DW2 that DW2, PW5, the appellant, Steven and Ramesh held discussions prior to the British Club break-in, even though it was never PW5`s evidence that such a discussion involving so many persons ever took place before the break-in.
In any event, even if this part of the appellant`s evidence was untrue, and the appellant never overheard them talking about the British Club, it still did not take the prosecution`s case very far. The appellant`s recollection of when the meeting took place was unlikely to be reliable. The appellant was describing an event that took place four years ago.
Secondly, it was not the appellant`s evidence that he took a taxi from work to see Steven just to be asked whether he could change coins into notes. His evidence was that Steven asked him to meet him and that it concerned something that should not be discussed over the phone. It seemed to me that to any reasonable person, this amounted to saying that it was something important, which would have justified the appellant leaving work and taking a taxi to meet Steven. Likewise, I was unable to see anything peculiar about Steven`s request that the appellant meet him.
In addition, there was hardly any reason for the appellant to have rushed down to the coffee shop if what PW5 said was true. The break-in had occurred the previous night, and according to PW5, the appellant was informed the following morning. The appellant only went to the coffee shop near Jalan Ampas in the evening.
In conclusion, even though I did not have the benefit of assessing PW5`s demeanor, I was satisfied that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction. The conviction was unsafe. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.",16/5/1997 0:00,SG High Court

Damien John Simpson (the accused) appeals against an order of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania 
    [1]
   which dismissed his appeal against a conviction for murder. He contends that his conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the Crown failed to tender any evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that he killed the deceased ""by means of [an] unlawful act  which [he] knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances""
                     
    [2]
  . Alternatively, he contends that the conviction for murder should be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted because the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the circumstances that could be taken into account in determining whether the accused ought to have known that his act was likely to cause death. He also contends that the judge's directions to the jury effectively reversed the onus of proof as to those circumstances.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 13 November 1996).

                           
Criminal Code Act 1924 
                           Tas, s 157(1)(c).



               

The charge of murder was laid under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code Act 1924 
                     Tas (the Criminal Code). That paragraph provides:Subject to the provisions of section 160, culpable homicide is murder if it is committed â€”
                           
                           
(c) by means of any unlawful act or omission which the offender knew, or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances, although he had no wish to cause death or bodily harm to any person.

                           
                        

                     

                  


               

The accused was tried before a judge and a jury of twelve in the Supreme Court of Tasmania 
    [3]
  . At the trial, the Crown tendered evidence that in June 1995, the accused killed Anthony William Smith by stabbing him in the neck with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade. From the evidence, the jury was entitled to conclude that, after an altercation had started between two groups, the accused ran across the road to the footpath and struck the deceased who was a member of one of the groups. Friends of the accused were in the other group. None of the eye witnesses saw the accused with a knife. One eye witness said that the accused ""just raised his hand and it looked like he had hit one of the fellows""; another said that the accused ""brought it down as in a hitting motion like he punched him"". But in a record of interview and in his evidence the accused admitted that he had stabbed the deceased with the knife. Medical evidence established that the deceased had been stabbed in the left side of the neck just above the collarbone. The entry wound measured 7.8 cm by 1.8 cm and was deep enough to cut one of the major branches of the aorta and pierce the upper part of the left lung.


Simpson v The Queen (unreported; Supreme Court of Tas; 6 December 1995).



               

The accused's record of interview contained the following admission:Are you able to tell me where you stabbed the man?No I wouldn't have a clue. I know it was on the upper part of the bo [sic], body though.
                     

                  


               

Later in the interview, the accused was asked:Did you, you said that you st, you st, [sic] you stabbed him in the upper part of the body?Yeah.
                        
And you realised that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em?
                        
Not if it's in the arm.
                        
I'm talkin [sic] about the upper body not the arms.
                        
I, yeah I did realise but I, I thought that it was probably around this area sort of, like from the arm to here. So I wasn't, I wasn't sure where I hit him, stabbed him at all.
                     
While describing ""this area sort of, like from the arm to here"", the accused pointed to an area just below the neck running across the chest from arm to arm.

               

In evidence, the accused claimed, as he had during his record of interview, that he killed the deceased in self-defence. He said that he crossed the road in the direction that his father and some friends had gone and that, when he got to the footpath, the deceased pushed him in the chest. The accused said, ""I freaked out. I pulled me knife out. It hit this young man."" He explained that by ""freaked out"" he meant that he ""was scared because [the deceased] was pushing me"" and that he was frightened that he ""was going to get beaten up"". The accused said in evidence that he had no medical training, knew nothing about medicine, and had not heard of the ""subclavium artery"". Under cross-examination, he admitted that he knew that ""in the upper part of the body between the heart and the face there are lots of arteries that carry blood"" and that ""blood vessels are going from the heart to various parts of the body  taking blood around"".

               

The trial judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence that the accused knew ""that what he was doing was likely to cause death"". That being so, the accused contends that he should not have been found guilty of murder because the Crown failed to tender evidence of circumstances from which the conclusion could be drawn that he ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause the death of the deceased. The accused contends that, when the Crown relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) to prove a charge of murder, the prosecution must fail unless the Crown establishes that the accused knew all the relevant facts which are relied on to give rise to the inference that he or she ought to have known that the unlawful act was likely to cause death. The accused argued that a charge under that limb of s 157(1)(c) is not proved if no more is shown than that ordinary persons â€” even ordinary twenty-one year old persons â€” know that the unlawful act was one that was likely to cause death.

   establishes that, when the prosecution relies on the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c), the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, and not some hypothetical person, ought to have known, if he or she had thought about it, that there was ""a ""real and not remote"" chance""
                     
    [5]
   that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased 
    [6]
  . That is to say, on the proven facts, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this accused with his or her knowledge ought to have known that there was a real chance that the unlawful act would bring about the death of the deceased. In Boughey 
                     
    [7]
  , Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ, who gave the leading judgment, said that ""the content of the knowledge laid at the door of an accused is [not] to be assessed by reference to the notional knowledge and capacity of some hypothetical person"". Their Honours went on to say that what was relevant for the purpose of the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) was ""the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""

Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

Counsel for the accused contended that the principles laid down in Boughey  led to the conclusion that there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that the accused ought to have known that his act might kill the deceased. He contended that ""without evidence of the particular expertise"" of the accused, the jury could only apply an objective test which ""was impermissible under Boughey 
                     "". But nothing in that case requires the conclusion that a prosecution under the ""ought to have known"" limb of s 157(1)(c) must fail unless the Crown proves the state of the accused's knowledge or ""expertise"" by direct evidence.

               

The issue in Boughey  was whether the trial judge had misdirected the jury by referring to the extent that the medical training and experience of the accused should have alerted him ""to the dangers of applying carotid artery pressure"" and ""to the desirability of studying medical literature in order to acquaint himself with the dangers, if any, of such a practice""
                     
    [9]
  . Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said 
    [10]
   that the trial judge's ""remarks about the desirability of studying medical literature would  have been mistaken if they meant that there was to be imputed to the [accused] the knowledge which he would have acquired if he had stopped to study such literature"". However, they held that, read in the context of a long summing up, the ""somewhat ambiguous remark"" of the trial judge had not diverted the jury from examining the accused's actual knowledge as opposed to knowledge that could be imputed to him from the medical literature.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.

                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29.



               

It was in that context that their Honours said that the starting point in the inquiry whether the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act was likely to cause death ""must be the knowledge, the intelligence and, where relevant, the expertise which the particular accused actually possessed.""
                     
    [11]
   Nothing in that passage or in the decision itself gives any support for the notion that the Crown cannot prove the accused's knowledge inferentially or that the prosecution must fail unless the Crown directly proves the knowledge and expertise of the accused concerning the relevant circumstances.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 28-29.



               

The accused's knowledge of or ""expertise"" concerning those circumstances may be proved by his or her own evidence, by out-of-court-admissions or by inference. If the Crown relies on inference to prove that the accused knew the relevant circumstances, the Crown may establish the inference by proving other facts that make it logical to infer that the accused knew the circumstances. If the charge is that the accused ought to have known that defective premises were likely to cause death to those entering them, it may be sufficient to prove that the defect was obvious and that the accused had visited the premises regularly even though the Crown is unable to prove by direct evidence or admission that the accused was aware of the defects in the premises.

               

Moreover, knowledge of the circumstances may often be inferred without proof of additional facts. Some or all of the circumstances may be so well known in a community or to a section of the community of which the accused is a member that it is open to a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew of those circumstances. If a fact or circumstance is so well known that no reasonable person in the section or community would dispute it, a jury may safely infer that the accused knew it unless any denial by him raises a reasonable doubt about his or her knowledge. What facts or circumstances fall into this category will vary from one era to another and from one community to another. The category of such facts and circumstances will be as wide as the common experience of the relevant community of which the accused is a member and will expand as the frontiers of that community's general knowledge expands.

               

No doubt the category is narrower than the list of matters of which a court can take judicial notice. A judge called on to take judicial notice of a fact may have regard to any fact or matter that is within the knowledge of ""every well-informed person in Australia""
                     
    [12]
  . Furthermore, in an appropriate case, the judge may cause ""inquiries to be made by himself for his own information from sources to which it is proper for him to refer""
                     
    [13]
  . When the issue is whether, in the absence of direct evidence, the jury can infer that the accused knew a particular fact or circumstance, however, the relevant community is that to which the accused belongs. The relevant knowledge of that community may be narrower or wider than that of well informed persons in Australia. If the accused is a doctor, for example, and the charge poses a medical issue, the Crown may prove the accused's knowledge by proving a fact or circumstance which no qualified practitioner could reasonably dispute. On the other hand, if the accused is a poorly educated youth in a remote area, the relevant body of knowledge will be that of youths of that class and may be much narrower than that of the general community.

Commonwealth Shipping Representative v Peninsular & Oriental Branch Service [1923] AC 191 at 212, per Lord Sumner.



               

The present case is concerned with the accused's knowledge of the likely result of stabbing a person with a knife. The consequences of using many common objects and substances are widely known in the Australian community. That guns kill, that acid burns, that flame ignites household gas and that driving on the wrong side of a road is likely to cause a collision, for example, are matters so well known in the Australian community that a jury can safely infer that the accused knew about such matters when they are relevant to a charge under s 157(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. Ordinary members of that community are also well aware of the consequences that can follow from most uses of knives, fire, gas, electricity and explosives. In cases where the accused has caused the death of a person by using such an object or substance, it will usually be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to infer that the accused knew what could follow from its use.

               

In the present case, the jury could find that the accused intended to stab the deceased somewhere in the upper chest area close to the neck and that he wielded the knife with considerable force. The question which then arises is whether the jury could reasonably find that the accused ought to have known that there was a real chance that his assault might cause the death of the deceased. That depends on whether he knew that forcefully stabbing a person in the upper chest area with a pocket knife which had a 7 cm blade might lead to the death of that person.

               

The accused was aged twenty-one when the events occurred. Nothing in the evidence indicated that he had less knowledge than other persons of his age concerning the consequences of stabbing a person in the upper chest area. That being so, the jury were entitled to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that there was a real chance that plunging a knife into the upper chest area of a person might lead to death. From an early age, Australian children learn from films, television, comics, books and newspapers that stabbing a person in the stomach, chest, back or neck is likely to kill that person if the knife blade is sharp and long enough and wielded with sufficient force. They may not know why or how the knife blade causes death although no doubt many of them know from an early age that a stabbing will cause bleeding. But they do know that stabbing a person in the neck or body is almost as likely to result in death as shooting a person in those areas. In evidence, the accused did not assert that he knew nothing about the potential consequences of stabbing a person in the upper body. Indeed, he conceded in his record of interview that he ""did realise"" 
                     ""that by stabbing somebody in that part of the body that you'd kill em"" (emphasis added). Even if the accused's admission is read as confined to stabbing a person in the neck, it was evidence from which the jury could find that he ought to have known that attempting to stab the deceased in the upper body area might lead to that person's death, if by chance or misadventure the knife went into his neck.

               

Given that it was open to the jury to find that the accused knew that stabbing somebody in the neck might kill that person, it necessarily follows that it was also open to them to find that the accused ought to have known that his unlawful act could cause death. The question for the jury under the ""ought to have known"" limb was not whether the accused intended to kill the deceased or stab him in the neck. Nor was it whether the accused knew that the knife might transect one of the major branches of the aorta. It was whether the accused, if he ""had stopped to think to the extent that he ought to have""
                     
    [14]
  , would have realised that stabbing the deceased with this knife in the general area of the upper body gave rise to a real chance that the stabbing would kill the deceased. The jury could reasonably find that, if the accused had thought about the matter, he would have realised that there was a real chance that, by bringing this knife down in the manner and in the direction that he did, the blade would enter the upper body of the deceased in or near the neck and inflict a fatal wound.



                           
Boughey (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 29, per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ.



               

Moreover, in determining what the accused knew, the jury were entitled to, and no doubt did, act on the basis that an ordinary twenty-one year old person knows that, if he or she forcefully stabs a person in the upper body with a knife that has a 7 cm blade, there is a real chance that it will kill that person. Independently of the accused's admission that he did realise that stabbing somebody ""in that part of the body"" might kill the person, the jury were entitled to think that the chance that the accused did not know what an ordinary twenty-one year old knows was so remote that it could be safely disregarded. Consequently, even if the accused had made no admission, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that he ought to have known that his unlawful act gave rise to a real chance that it might cause the death of the deceased.

               
                  
Misdirection
                  

Alternatively, the accused contended that, even if the admissions made by him in his record of interview were evidence ""as to [his] subjective state of mind"", ""the learned trial judge had a duty to warn the jury in the strongest possible terms that this evidence was not at all cogent in terms of its capacity to establish that state of mind in the subjective sense required by Boughey 
                        "". He also contended that the trial judge had a duty ""to ensure that the jury did not lapse into a review conducted in an objective manner"".

                  

In summing up to the jury on the ""ought to have known"" issue, the trial judge said:In what circumstances should a person have known that his act was likely to cause death. You have to consider this from the position of Mr Simpson, the accused. We're not talking about what some hypothetical person ought to have known or what you would have known, the question is what he ought to have known. So with his actual state of knowledge, his age, which is twenty-one, we don't know much about him really we haven't really been told much about him. But you've heard him in the witness box you might be able to make some assessment of him and you've seen him on that video of course. But with his actual state of knowledge and capacity as you determine the[m] to have been, then you look at the circumstances he was placed in and you determine, you make a judgment and determine ought he to have known that his unlawful act, if there was one, was likely to cause death, even if he didn't want to cause it. You should consider had he stopped to think to the extent that you think he should have, would he have known or appreciated that death was likely to ensue from his act. I'll put it another way, to what extent do you consider that he ought to have stopped to think and if he had done so, would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result. Now that's what ought to have known involves. And let me go to the next bit, ought to have known that it was likely to cause death. The expression ""likely to cause death"" is one you can probably understand but you might have difficulty defining it if you had to. However, it's something, if something is likely to happen or there is a good chance that it will happen it probably means the same thing. It is something that may well happen, you might say it may not happen, but there is a good chance that it will happen. It's likely to happen, these are all similar expressions. So likely to cause death is an ordinary expression which is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real chance as distinct from what is a mere possibility. A good chance that it will happen, something that may well happen, something that is likely to happen, but not just a mere possibility. Now I hope that helps you but look at the words that are used in the memorandum ""likely"" is the word that's used there. So did he know that death was likely to be caused or ought he to have known that death was likely to be caused by his act. That's the question for you. It's a question of fact for the Jury to determine.
                     


                  

The learned judge gave the jury no directions as to how they might determine the accused's state of knowledge; nor did he refer in terms to the admissions of the accused. However, his Honour was under no obligation to give such directions, and counsel for the accused at the trial sought no directions at the conclusion of the summing up. That being so, his Honour's directions cannot be faulted. There is no reason to think that the jury applied an objective test or that the directions permitted ""the onus of proof to shift away from the Crown in respect to proving circumstances peculiar to the [accused] sufficient to allow a jury to find a subjective state of mind in the [accused]"". Nor is there any reason to suppose that the trial miscarried in any way.

                  

His Honour made it clear to the jury that they had to consider the ""ought to have known"" issue ""from the position of  the accused"" and that it was his ""actual state of knowledge"" and not that of ""some hypothetical person"" that was relevant. The learned judge also told the jury that they had to consider that, if the accused had stopped to think about the matter ""would he have known or appreciated that if he stabbed Mr Smith, death was a likely result"". Given these directions, there is no ground for thinking that the jury would have applied an objective test in determining whether the accused ""ought to have known"" that death was the likely result of his unlawful act.

Kirby and Callinan JJ.
               

Mr Damien John Simpson (the appellant) appeals against the order of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal dismissing his appeal against his conviction for murder. The victim, Mr Tony Smith, died of a single stab wound inflicted in his neck by the appellant.

               
                  
Background facts and admissions to the police
                  

The appellant, a man of twenty-one years at the time of the offence, spent about three hours in the evening of 10 June 1995 at an hotel in Launceston drinking beer and some whiskey. At about half past midnight, he left the hotel in company with five other people, including his father, to walk into the city. On the way, three men accosted one of the appellant's party, Mr Ivan Quarrell, and asked for a cigarette. In a police interview which was recorded on videotape and which commenced some seven or so hours after the events to be described, the appellant gave this account of what occurred:Um, Ivan was talkin to some blokes, three blokes an um, they asked for a cigarette, an Ivan gave em a cigarette and then we walked across the road an Ivan said that um he took me cigarettes, so me father went down across the road an um asked for the cigarettes and they were bein real smart an um  then I ran, then I ran across the road to where me father was an then they started, this bloke started pushin me around and then um first thing I done was grab me knife, cos [he] was pushin me around.
                     


                  

A little later in the interview, the appellant enlarged upon that account:
                           

                              
Q Do you normally carry a knife, do you normally carry this knife all the time?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q And whereabouts did you have the knife?

                              
                              
A In my back pocket.

                              
                              
Q And was it open or was it closed when 
                              

                              
                              
A Yeah, it was closed.

                              
                              
Q Did you open it when you pulled it out of your pocket?

                              
                              
A Yep.

                              
                              
Q After this fi , this fellow was pushing you around 
                              

                              
                              
A Mm.

                              
                              
Q 
                                  and you've opened your knife, knife up, what did you do then?

                              
                              
A I leaned, I was tryin ta when he was pushin me, I was, I, all that I done was pulled out me knife an then he pushed me again an then I went like that an then 
                              

                              
                              
Q When did you open it then?

                              
                              
A When it was in me pocket I just went like that an then it flipped open, like as soon as I pulled it out of me, out of me pocket.

                              
                              
Q And how many times did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A Once I think.

                              
                              
Q Whereabouts did you hit him with it?

                              
                              
A I wouldn't have a clue.

                              
                              
Q Was he facing you?

                              
                              
A Yeah he was cos [he] was pushing me so, yeah he woulda been facing me.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

In the interview, the appellant was interrogated about his state of mind:
                           

                              
Q Why did you do it?

                              
                              
A Why, cos I was frightened.

                              
                              
Q Frightened of what?

                              
                              
A Because that bloke was pushin me, like cos I thought he was gunna punch me head in (sniff).

                              
                              
Q What was your intention when you pulled your knife out and opened it up?

                              
                              
A No intentions cos I didn't think, I just, I was just tryina get away sorta thing.

                              
                              
Q Well, at the time of pulling the knife out and opening up, did you intend to use the knife?

                              
                              
A Not real, nah. Well as, the split, it happened in a split second that's all I know.

                              
                              
                              
Q At the time that you pulled the knife out though did you intend to kill him?

                              
                              
A No I didn't. I didn't even intend to pull the knife out at all, I didn't, I didn't mean to stab him at all, just (sniff) somin that, it just happened.

                              
                           

                        

                     


                  

Later, the appellant said that he was scared of his victim who was a ""pretty big bloke"" and was pushing him around. He also expressly denied the investigating police officer's direct assertion that he had intended to stab the deceased. He claimed that he was fairly drunk at the time but admitted, at one point at least, that he knew what he was doing. The Crown called as witnesses, other members of the two groups and an independent witness, a taxi driver who had witnessed the events. There were various differences in their testimony. However, they were remarkably consistent with respect to their observations of how the fatal blow was inflicted by the appellant: that he ran up to the victim, either with his hand raised, or that he raised it when he reached the victim, to strike at him and then, ran away.

                  

The appellant gave evidence at his trial. No other evidence was called in his case. We do not read his evidence as being in substance any different from the account that he gave when he was interviewed by the investigating police officers. Although some of the witnesses' versions were vague, no doubt as a result, in part at least, of the consumption of alcohol, one matter was clear at the trial: that the appellant was not under any direct, serious, personal, physical threat before he struck the victim with his knife.

                  

At trial, the appellant relied on self-defence 
    [15]
  . Clearly this was rejected by the jury. No point now arises about that. Alternatively, the appellant submitted before the jury that, if the Crown had satisfied them that self-defence was negatived, the proper verdict in the circumstances was one of manslaughter. This was so on the ground that the appellant neither knew, nor ought to have known, that death was likely to result from his actions.

Count 2 - That he did between 8 and 9 June 2008 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales supply an amount of prohibited drug, to wit methylamphetamine 995 grams being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
2Each offence was contrary to s25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMT Act) and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3500 penalty units, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3In relation to Count 2, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account a number of Form 1 matters:

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
Ground 2 - The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in the light of the sentence imposed on the co-offender referred to as OS1.
Factual Background
7The applicant was born in 1952 and is the father of Bassam Hamzy and Ghassan Amoun and the uncle of Mohammed Hamze.
8Between 21 April 2007 and 7 July 2008 Bassam Hamzy was a sentenced prisoner at Lithgow Gaol.  He was in possession of an unauthorised mobile telephone.
9Between 1 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 that telephone service was lawfully intercepted.  During this time, a high level of organised criminal activity was identified.  The mobile phone was used on average 460 times a day and the majority of the calls recorded were associated with the activities of the criminal group.  
10The calls revealed that Bassam Hamzy was the principal of a criminal group which operated a drug supply network between Sydney and Melbourne between May and June 2008.
11The criminal group comprised family members of Bassam Hamzy, including the applicant and associates.  Bassam Hamzy led and directed the activities of the group by sourcing and distributing prohibited drugs and managing the profits from the sales and otherwise managing the group including seeking out new members.
12In total the syndicate was involved in nine discrete instances of supplying a prohibited drug.  The applicant was involved in three of those supplies.
Count 1 - Supply of commercial quantity methylamphetamine (372 grams)
13On Monday 5 May 2008 Bassam Hamzy was contacted by Mohammed Hamze, who was a relative.  Those conversations discussed transporting drugs from Melbourne and finding a courier to transport drugs to Melbourne.  Subsequently, OS1, who owned a small transport company, was recruited as the courier for the syndicate using his legitimate company to conceal the illegal operations of the syndicate.
14On 17 and 18 May Bassam Hamzy, OS1, Mohammed Hamze and Ghassan Amoun agreed to supply Imran Allouche with 372 grams of methylamphetamine.
15The methylamphetamine to be supplied to Allouche was obtained by the applicant.  The applicant in turn provided the drugs to Amoun who delivered them to OS1.  OS1 took this package to Melbourne and with Mohammed Hamze arranged to supply the methylamphetamine to Imran Allouche.
16Telephone discussions took place in the course of which money owed to the syndicate by a Con Bodiotis was discussed.  OS1 confirmed that he had $21,000 that was part payment from Bodiotis for drugs previously supplied.  Arrangements were made for OS1 to go to the home of the applicant and give him the $21,000.  This occurred.  (The collection of the $21,000 from Bodiotis is the foundation of the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being charge number 1 on the Form 1.)
17On 17 May discussions took place as to the purity of the drug being supplied.  One of those conversations involved Bassam Hamzy and the applicant.  The applicant who had called the supplier said that the drugs were of better purity than those supplied to them previously.
18Subsequently, a new price for the drugs was negotiated because of the purity.  OS1 confirmed that he took the drugs directly from Amoun and then passed them onto Allouche.  On 20 May 2008 OS1 contacted Bassam Hamzy and during this conversation they spoke of Allouche owing the syndicate $85,000.
Count 2 - Supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 8 - 14 June 2008 (995 grams)
19On 8 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and the applicant agreed that the applicant would obtain a significant quantity of methylamphetamine from an unknown supplier.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that the price for the drug was $185,000.  The drug had a high level of purity.  By 9 June 2008 the applicant had successfully obtained 995 grams of methylamphetamine from the supplier.
20In due course OS1 attended upon the applicant and collected the methylamphetamine.  Those drugs were taken to Melbourne for on-supply.  In discussions between OS1 and Bassam Hamzy, the drugs were described as of high quality.  OS1 was given directions to supply 164 grams to Con Bodiotis and the remaining quantity to other persons who were named.  Payment of $110,000 for 500 grams of methylamphetamine was eventually negotiated.
21On the evening of 10 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy and OS1 spoke about the proceeds of the supply (and intended supply) of the methylamphetamine.  Bassam Hamzy told OS1 to tell the applicant that he missed his flight and would return to Sydney with the money the following day.  Later that night, OS1 told Bassam Hamzy that he had so far collected $33,500 from Bodiotis.  Subsequently, most of the methylamphetamine was supplied to Bodiotis.  By the evening of 12 June 2008 OS1 advised that he had collected $65,000 from Con Bodiotis and that Bodiotis owed a further $125,000.
22On 13 June the applicant complained to Bassam Hamzy about how long it was taking for the money to be collected and that his supplier would not trust him any more.  The applicant told Mohammed Hamze that he had to get $185,000 to pay his supplier for the methylamphetamine before anything else.
23At 10.20pm on 13 June 2008, the applicant travelled from Sydney to Melbourne and received $117,000 collected by OS1 and Mohammed Hamze (the collection of the $117,000 is the offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime being Charge (4) on the Form 1).
24The applicant then returned to Sydney from Melbourne driving the same car OS1 had used to transport the kilogram of methylamphetamine on 9 June 2008.
25In a conversation on the afternoon of 14 June 2008, OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant was ""dirty"" because he thought there was money missing.  OS1 told Mohammed Hamze that the applicant thought there should be $240,000 but only collected $117,000 from OS1.  At 7pm on 14 June 2008 Con Bodiotis told Mohammed Hamze that he was still owed $56,000 and was arranging that amount of money for tomorrow.  Mohammed Hamze said his uncle (the applicant) was ""fuming"".  OS1 flew to Sydney from Melbourne, arriving in Sydney at 10.35pm.
26On 23 August 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was lawfully recorded.  During this conversation both the applicant and his son discussed various amounts of money owed to them, including from Mohammed Hamze.  Bassam Hamzy was recorded as saying that Mohammed had ripped them off for $90,000.
Additional Form 1 facts
Charge 2 and 3 on the Form 1:  Supply prohibited drug (182 grams of  methylamphetamine) and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime ($31,400)
27Between 5 and 6 June 2008 Bassam Hamzy agreed to supply a quantity of methylamphetamine to Con Bodiotis.  The applicant obtained 182 grams of methylamphetamine which was delivered to Khaled Taleb who took the drug to Melbourne and delivered it to Con Bodiotis.
28On 6 June 2008 a conversation took place between Bassam Hamzy and Con Bodiotis.  A price for the methylamphetamine to be supplied was negotiated.  Due to the poor quality of the drug, Bodiotis would only have to pay $33,500 for 6 ounces.
29At 6pm on 7 June 2008 a conversation between Bassam Hamzy and the applicant was intercepted.  In this conversation Bassam Hamzy and the applicant discussed how much they should collect for the drug.  The applicant told Bassam Hamzy that he paid $5,180 per ounce for the drug.  In subsequent conversations, Bassam Hamzy discussed the collection of money from Con Bodiotis, being payment for the supply of 182 grams of methylamphetamine.  Eventually, Con Bodiotis arranged for $31,400 in total to be delivered to the applicant and this took place.
Charge No 5 on the Form 1
Participating in a criminal group from 1 May 2008 to 5 July 2008
30In May 2008 OS1 was the sole director of Parcdel Pty Ltd.  That company operated three refrigerated trucks in the Sydney area.  OS1 advised Bassam Hamzy that the business was heavily in debt and that he was close to having his fleet of trucks repossessed.  Bassam Hamzy and OS1 came to an arrangement whereby Bassam Hamzy was to support the business with his own money and from the proceeds of subsequent supplies of prohibited drugs.  In return for the injection of money, OS1 agreed that the company would act as a front for other activities involving Bassam Hamzy's family and associates.  A number of Bassam Hamzy's family members, including the applicant, were to be directors of the company.
31BPay accounts were set up to allow the depositing of monies directly into the company accounts.  Parcdel's trucks were to be used for the supply of drugs to interstate purchasers under the guise of carrying on a legitimate freight business.
Proceedings in the District Court and the findings of the sentencing judge
32In reviewing the facts, his Honour found that the drug supply network operated by Bassam Hamzy depended for its success upon persons such as the applicant who were willing to become involved in facilitating negotiations and other arrangements for the supply of the prohibited drugs.
33In relation to assistance provided to the authorities, his Honour noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant approached the authorities and provided a line of communication between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy with a view to the Crime Commission furthering legitimate investigative operational objectives.  The importance of that communication was that Bassam Hamzy had told the Crime Commission officers that he was able to return certain items which the Crime Commission was looking for.  His Honour found that there was a real issue as to whether Bassam Hamzy ever had the knowledge and capacity to retrieve the particular items.  His Honour accepted that the applicant genuinely thought that his son did have such a capacity.
34It was the applicant's submission that the only way these items could be obtained was if sufficient money was available to purchase them.  Since the Crime Commission was not prepared to pay that money, it was necessary for him and his son to deal in drugs in order to obtain money to pay for these items.  The applicant believed that the acquisition of these items would improve his position and that of Bassam Hamzy with the Crime Commission.  The Crown disputed that this was the applicant's motivation.  The Crown submitted that profit was the prime motivation.
35His Honour found (ROS 35.5) as follows:
""The matter must proceed on the basis that the offender was involved in the supply of drugs for a limited period between 17 May and 24 June, a period a little over one month.  However the material before me, including the conduct of the offender beyond this period and inferences that can be drawn from what the offender said in the intercepted calls, provide colour and context to the true role of the offender in the particular supplies for which he is to be sentenced.   It would be artificial to look only at the conduct of the offender in the steps towards effecting the particular supplies when there is a body of other evidence to place his conduct in some context and which would assist in understanding his role in the overall enterprise compared to other participants and in particular in understanding his position in relation to Bassam Hamzy and OS1.""
His Honour decided that it would be best to proceed on the basis of what the applicant actually did (ROS 35.9).
36His Honour described the participation of the applicant as follows (ROS 36.1):
""In relation to the three occasions the offender played a role in the supply of prohibited drug, the offender was involved in the procurement of the drug for on supply. The evidence suggests that he sourced the drug from one particular supplier.
The offender was engaged in the processes towards the delivery of the drug and it's transportation to Melbourne. The offender also played a significant role in the recouping of monies that were collected by others in Melbourne.
The offender was at all times acting on the direction of his son though he was able to bring some enterprise into the procuring of the drug.  Contributions he made in discussions with Bassam Hamzy about procurement of the drug would suggest that he was able to bring some knowledge of the illicit drug trade into the negotiating process. As can be seen in the extracts of the intercepted calls I have referred to the offender speaks with Bassam Hamzy about aspects of the negotiation for the procurement of the drug including references to the quality and quantity of the drug procured from the supplier.
The offender at times organised others in effecting steps in the supply of the drug in Melbourne. On one occasion he provided a vehicle to OS1 to transport a quantity of drug. He also adopted a role in overseeing the collection of monies and acted as the repository of the monies realised in the supplies in which he was involved.  The offender provided a crucial role in putting into effect the supplies promoted by his son who was otherwise constrained by his incarceration.  In that regard the offender provided an effective conduit for Bassam Hamzy.
The involvement of the accused at the level of procurement, the nature of the discussions with his son at the time of procurement, the involvement of the offender in the collection of monies, his overseeing role at times and the provision of assistance to those effecting the transactions support the conclusion that, in those supplies that he was involved in, he was at the nucleus of the organisation of the supply. He provided essential support and assistance to his son Bassam Hamzy and was involved in a number of steps in the planning of the supplies.
I am of the view, having considered the content of the intercepted calls that the offender would have been aware of the scale of the operation that Bassam Hamzy was controlling from custody. With regard to the matter on the form one relating to the offender's participation in a criminal group, I am of the view that the offender intended a continuing role in the criminal enterprise controlled by Bassam Hamzy. The conduct of the offender in assisting Bassam Hamzy referred to in the statement of facts extends past the period in which the offender was involved in the supply offences for which he faces sentence.""
37At ROS 38.8 his Honour said:
""It is conceded by counsel for the offender that the offender's role was pivotal in the supply of substantial quantities of prohibited drug in the three supply transactions in which he was involved.  ...
I am not of the view that the offender's role was the equivalent of Bassam Hamzy in the drug supplies in which he was involved. I am of the view also that the role of OS1 was ultimately greater than the role of the offender. I will further refer to the role of OS1 when considering the issue of parity of sentence.""
38In relation to the quantity of drugs involved, his Honour said:
""Quantity is not the sole determinative factor. The offender was however trafficking in prohibited drugs to a substantial degree. In relation to count one, the quantity involved, 372 grams, is towards the bottom half of the range of quantities within the commercial quantity for methylamphetamine.  The amount of 995g is at the top of the range of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine.  The quantity of drug the subject of the third supply on the form one, 182 grams, is less than the commercial quantity.""
His Honour found that the applicant ""knew that the purpose of the supplies was to realise a substantial profit"".  (ROS 39.4)
39In relation to motivation, his Honour found:
""Whilst there was a benefit to the community in the retrieval of the [items], I cannot be satisfied that this was a motivation for his offending.  I am of the view that the offender's motives were not altruistic.  He was keen for a significant benefit to flow to his son from the retrieval of them [items] and he was prepared to engage in substantial criminal conduct to achieve that purpose. In his attempts to achieve that purpose he was prepared to be involved in the dissemination of large quantities of prohibited drug, which would have had as a consequence substantial harm to the community.  The content and nature of the intercepted conversations in which the offender was involved, which I have referred to at length, and his conduct in effecting the supplies do not suggest any impaired or flawed thinking.
The offending is objectively serious and calls for a strong element of deterrence.""
40His Honour reviewed the applicant's personal factors.  He was born in Lebanon.  He had a happy childhood, except for the Lebanese civil war which affected his village.  He migrated to Australia in 1973 at the age of 20 but returned to Lebanon at the end of 1974.  He married in Lebanon in 1975.  Due to further civil unrest in Lebanon in 1975, he returned to Australia with his wife.  Together the applicant and his wife had five children.  On return to Australia, the applicant maintained regular employment until he injured his back and neck in a car accident in 1982.  He ceased work and received a substantial compensation payout in 1986.
41In 1988 the applicant gained part-time employment as a leather cutter and in 1989, he and a friend created a company to export powdered milk to Lebanon.  This company was used to facilitate the importation of heroin.  The company was wound up when the applicant was arrested in 1991.  The applicant received a lengthy sentence for the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin and was not released to parole until 2005.  Upon his release, he worked part-time until May 2008.  The applicant was receiving unemployment benefits at the time of his arrest for these offences.
42The applicant's marriage was dissolved in 1996.  He said that he maintained a close relationship with all of his children.  
43As already indicated, the most significant matter insofar as the applicant's criminal record was concerned is his conviction of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin, for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.  The applicant was on parole for that matter when he committed the offences, the subject of this appeal.  
44His Honour accepted that his plea of guilty indicated a degree of remorse.  In relation to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, his Honour said:
""I am satisfied that the plea of guilty was entered on 22 November, 2011.  The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court following committal proceedings where the issue was the quantity of drug involved.  The crown subsequently accepted a plea to a lesser count of supply the commercial quantity of prohibited drug.  The offender was committed for sentence from the local court.  The pleas could be said to have been entered at an early opportunity.
The offender is entitled, having regard to the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, to a discrete discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. 
I will return to set out the discount for the offender's plea together with the discount on sentence for the offender's assistance to the authorities.""  (ROS 45.8)
45His Honour found it difficult to assess the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and was unable to make any meaningful prediction.  His Honour noted that the applicant was involved again in criminal conduct of a most serious kind and faced a further lengthy period of imprisonment.  His Honour also noted that the applicant had spent a considerable period of his adult life in custody, i.e. 16 of the last 19 Â½ years.
46Nevertheless, given his age on release, his Honour considered that the applicant would require some continuing assistance through supervision.  His Honour thought that the parole period which he intended to impose would allow sufficient opportunity for supervision and accordingly, he declined to find special circumstances.
47His Honour took into account parity, with particular reference to OS1.  His Honour said:
""Ensuring parity in sentencing with the sentences imposed upon the offender OS1 is not without difficulty.  There are limitations in comparing the sentences imposed.  Prosecutorial decisions as to the groupings of particular amounts of drug make it difficult to determine the sentence imposed on those amounts supplied which are common to both the offender and OS1.  Counts involving the large commercial quantity were proffered which grouped what are supplies within a course of conduct.
The counts to which the offender OS1 pleaded guilty involved the supply of large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs together with other unrelated criminal activity.
OS1 was sentenced for his involvement in additional supply offences identified in the intercepted calls for which the offender does not face sentence here.
On the material before me the offender OS1, over time, became significantly involved in the overall management of the movement of the drugs and in significant aspects of the negotiation of the supplies.  The offender OS1 was substantially involved in the collection of monies the subject of the sales on behalf of the syndicate.  The offender OS1 played a critical role in the preparation and transport of substantial quantities of drug.  These findings are consistent with the findings of the sentencing judge. OS1 ultimately became a significant member in the syndicate operated by Bassam Hamzy.
OS1 was involved in a number of supply transactions over a greater period. The offences for which he was sentenced involved greater quantities of drugs. 
OS1 was also sentenced on an objectively serious offence of aggravated break enter and steal. He received a separate sentence for that offence of two years with a non-parole of 18 months.
I am of the view that in all of the circumstances here issues concerning parity of sentence with OS1, whilst relevant, have only limited application.""  (ROS 50.1)
48His Honour then reviewed the applicant's assistance to authorities.  His Honour noted that the applicant had provided information to authorities which had led to an Islamic cleric being banned from entering gaol because this cleric was responsible for radical Islamic teachings amongst prisoners.
49He provided information about some murder suspects, but these suspects were already known to the police.  He did not make a statement.  The information provided was not particularly valuable.  He acted as conduit between the Crime Commission and Bassam Hamzy, but ultimately that communication led to nothing and no reliable information was provided.  In relation to that contact, his Honour said:
""In relation to the offender's assistance generally, it would appear at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his son's within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""
50The only real assistance provided by the applicant to authorities was that he arranged for one of his sons to deliver 9 firearms and a quantity of ammunition and explosives to the police.  In relation to that, his Honour said:
""The letter of assistance notes that the nature and extent of assistance was limited. No information was given as to the source of the items.""
51Nevertheless, the surrender of the firearms and explosives was of some benefit to the community in that they were capable of causing substantial harm and had the potential to be used in unlawful activities.
52His Honour's conclusions in relation to s23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be set out:
""I have taken into account the matters to be considered in s 23(2).   The significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance has not been assessed as high. 
The offender has placed himself at some personal risk however, unless the nature of his assistance is disseminated, he is not, on the material before me, likely to suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance.
Section 23(3) provides that any lesser penalty that is imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
It is relevant, as the Crown has submitted, that the offender has already received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
In SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19, Buddin J considered at length the authorities concerning the appropriate range of the composite discount for assistance and the plea of guilty and concluded that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case.
I am of the view that in the circumstances of the present case that a combined discount for assistance and the guilty plea should be in the order of 30%.""  (ROS 53.6)
53By way of additional information, it should be noted that OS1 successfully appealed to this Court against the sentence imposed on him (OS1 v R [2012] NSWCCA 102 (Allsop P; Davies and Schmidt JJ).  OS1 pleaded guilty to four offences as follows:
Count 1 - Aggravated (in company) break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely the larceny of a quantity of frozen food (maximum penalty - 20 years  with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
Count 2 - Supply a prohibited drug, being more than the indictable quantity, namely 140.7g cocaine (maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment). Count 3 - Supply large quantity prohibited drug, namely MDMA 600g (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
Count 4 - Supply large commercial quantity prohibited drug, namely 2.154 kg methylamphetamine (maximum penalty - imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment).
54The following offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of Count 4:
(a)Knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime (four offences);
(b)Supply prohibited drug being more than the indictable quantity, namely 6.68 kg cannabis;
(c)Participating in a criminal group;
(d)Knowingly take part in the supply of prohibited drug more than the indictable quantity, namely 56g cocaine;
(e)Possess prohibited drug, namely 2.6g cocaine
(f)Drive while under the influence of drugs (cocaine).
55OS1 was sentenced by Judge King SC on 29 October 2010 as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year six months commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring on 29 May 2010. Count 2 - Fixed   term   of  imprisonment  of  eighteen   months commencing on 30 May 2009.
Count 3 - Imprisonment for six years consisting of a non parole period of four years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring on 29 November 2013.
Count 4 - Taking into account the matters on a Form One, imprisonment for eight years consisting of a non-parole period of five years commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring on 29 November 2015.
The effective sentence was a period of imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of seven years commencing 30 November 2008 and expiring 29 November 2015.
56That sentence had incorporated in it a combined discount of 50 percent for both the plea of guilty and assistance.  That discount was further broken down so that 25 percent was apportioned to the plea of guilty, 5 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.  This Court had before it in the appeal a confidential document.  That document made it clear that OS1 had already provided considerable assistance in relation to the past and had undertaken to give evidence against a large number of persons in the future.  It was accepted by Judge King SC that OS1 had a justified fear for himself and his family.  The Court considered that the level of assistance provided by OS1 was exceptional and that a combined discount of 60 percent should have been applied, which would be apportioned as to 25 percent for the early plea, 15 percent for past assistance and 20 percent for future assistance.
57Following that adjustment, the sentences for Counts 3 and 4 were quashed and replaced with the following:
""(a) In respect of the offence charged in Count Three a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 30 November 2009 and expiring 29 November 2012 with an additional term of 1 year;
(b) In respect of the offence charged in Count Four and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing 30 November 2010 and expiring 29 May 2014 with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months.""
58Allowing for the effect of the 60 percent discount, the undiscounted total sentence for Count 4 was one of 15 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months.  By way of contrast, the undiscounted sentence for the applicant in respect of Count 2, was a head sentence of 12 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months.  The total undiscounted sentence imposed on the applicant for both counts was 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years.
Ground 1 - In granting the applicant a combined discount of 30 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and the value of the assistance he provided, his Honour entertained a false presumption that the applicant had previously received some benefit from his offer of assistance.
59Despite the terms in which this ground has been expressed, the effect of oral submissions was that the extent of the discount for assistance was inadequate and that a discount which was substantially greater should have been allowed.
60In relation to the specific terms of Ground 1, his Honour noted at ROS 52.8 that:
"" ... at the time of providing information to the Crime Commission he sought benefits from that assistance from the authorities including the transfer of one of his sons within the prison system and the restoration of visiting rights.""

This is an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the district judge dismissing the plaintiffs` claim against the defendant for damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of a collision between a pick-up van No GF 6713Y driven by the defendant and a motorcycle No AZ 3705 ridden by the second plaintiff with the first plaintiff as pillion rider.
The collision occurred along Clementi Road on 28 August 1982 at about 4.30pm near the entrance to Ngee Ann Technical College (NATC). At that junction, Clementi Road was a dual carriageway with three lanes going towards Bukit Timah Road and the other three lanes going in the opposite direction. Both the second plaintiff and the defendant reported the accident separately to the traffic police a few hours after the accident. The second plaintiff`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 1630 hours at Clementi Road, I was riding my motorcycle carrying one pillion (tel: 4684659), at a speed of about 60 km/h, travelling at the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713 when it turned without giving signal and I could not avoid but collided onto the front left side of the pickup.
 
 
 
The motorcycle fell and my pillion was injured. Ambulance conveyed us to Alexandra Hospital. Nobody was injured in the pick-up. The pick-up was dented slightly on the left front part. No rain and visibility clear. That is all.
The defendant`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 4.15pm, I am driving along Clementi Road intending to make a left turn to Ngee Ann College. Whilst driving, before I made a left turn to Ngee Ann College, I switched on my left signal indicator, suddenly a motorcycle AZ 3705C came on my left side, whilst I was about to turn, the said motorcycle grazed onto the left side of my motor pick-up. As a result the motorcyclist`s pillion was injured, on the hand and right leg. My motor pick-up left side was damaged, the side mirror broken.
 
 
 
At the trial, the testimony of the second plaintiff was substantially the same as what he had said in his police report save for the elaboration that the traffic was moderate and that the pick-up van was travelling in the middle lane of the three-lane road going towards Bukit Timah Road when the van turned suddenly into the entrance into NATC. He also said that he was not trying to overtake the van and that he could not remember which part of the van he collided into. He was asked to mark (which he did) the point of impact with an `X` on the police sketch plan of the scene of accident. The first plaintiff, in his testimony, corroborated the evidence of the second plaintiff. He remembered seeing a blue shadow suddenly moving across the path of the motor-cycle.
The defendant testified that when he was approaching NATC, he signalled, looked at the rear view mirror and then turned left into the entrance to NATC, that as he was doing so, the motorcycle collided into his van. He also said that before he made the turn, he was travelling on the innermost left lane. Under cross-examination, he claimed (a) that he was travelling on this lane all the way after turning into Clementi Road from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim; (2) that he switched on the indicator light about four to five car lengths from the entrance into NATC; (3) that on looking at his rear mirror he saw a motor car, but not the motorcycle, behind him travelling in the same lane; and (4) that he did not look at the left wing side mirror before he turned. The defendant had two passengers in his car at the time of the accident. One of them appeared as a witness to testify (1) that the van had travelled for about two miles on the extreme left lane whilst keeping to the centre of the lane; and (2) that the defendant did signal before turning left into NATC as he heard a `tick tick` sound.
At the end of the trial, the district judge found that the defendant was not negligent and that the second plaintiff was wholly to blame for the collision. In his grounds of decision, he gave the following reasons for his finding: 
 
The plaintiffs and defendant told conflicting stories. Each party was trying to put the blame on the other. In order to verify the evidence the court had to rely on evidence such as the police report. The second plaintiff stated in his report that he was travelling on the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713Y. The vehicle turned without giving signal. The defendant said that while he was about to turn the motorcycle grazed his left side. He had switched on his left indicator.
 
 
 
From the above it clearly showed that the second plaintiff was following behind the defendant. Both he and the defendant were travelling on the left lane. While the defendant was turning the plaintiff must have grazed him and then landed in the position marked `M`. There was a scratch mark leading to position `M`. The second plaintiff confirmed under cross-examination that the collision took place at the point marked `X`. Obviously, the second plaintiff was trying to overtake the defendant on the left side. From the point of impact and the scratch mark the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, otherwise on a head to side collision the motorcycle would remain at the point of collision. This confirmed that the defendant did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane to the left lane as alleged by the second plaintiff. Hence, the second plaintiff was the sole cause of the accident. He must have tried to overtake the defendant who was turning to its left, then grazed the defendant`s vehicle and landed on point marked `M`.
Counsel for the plaintiffs have submitted that the findings of fact of the district judge were inferential findings and that he was in error in making such findings. It is well established that an appellate court will not normally disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge based upon an evaluation of the oral testimonies of the parties and their witnesses as he is a far better position to assess their credibility having seen and heard them. However, where the findings of fact on which the decision is based are themselves inferences from primary facts, the appellate court `is in as good a position, or as bad a position, as the trial judge to form a view as to what happened`(per Thomson CJ in 
 Foong Yit Yoon v Yap Tiam & Anor 
 
[1963] MLJ 104
 at p 108).
Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted before me that the district judge`s finding that the defendant was not negligent was based not on his assessment of the truth or otherwise of the parties who gave evidence, he being unable to come to any conclusion as to whom to believe, but primarily on inferences drawn from the police reports of the second plaintiff and the defendant.
I agree. The extract I have quoted from the trial judge`s grounds of decision shows that the findings of the trial judge upon which he found the second plaintiff was solely to blame for the collision were as follows: (1) the pick-up van was on the extreme left lane of the road and the second plaintiff was following it on the same lane; (2) the collision occurred at the point `X` on the sketch plan as marked by the second plaintiff; (3) from the point of impact and the scratch mark leading to the final position of the motorcycle, `M`, the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, ie on a head to side collision, as the motorcycle would have stopped dead at the point of collision; in other words, it was not a head to side collision; (4) from this, it would follow that the motorcycle must have been trying to overtake the pick-up van; and (5) therefore the van did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane.
Every single finding of fact set out above is an inferential fact. This court is therefore in as good a position as the trial judge to assess the correctness of these findings of fact. The trial judge did not believe the second plaintiff`s version of how the collision occurred primarily because it could not have occurred in the manner described by him having regard to the point of impact as marked by him on the police sketch plan. In my view, the trial judge was wrong in accepting as correct the point of impact as marked by the second plaintiff. The trial judge should have, in the light of the other objective evidence, considered whether the second plaintiff`s account was consistent with the other objective evidence. The second plaintiff obviously had a faint recollection of an event which had occurred more than five years earlier. This is proved by his candid admission in his evidence in chief that he could not even remember where his motorcycle had collided into the pick-up van.
To make it easier to follow my analysis, I annex hereto a copy of the sketch plan. In my view, the point marked `X` could not be the point of impact because it is well beyond the point at which the van was damaged. According to the report of the traffic police who inspected the scene of the accident as well as the two vehicles immediately after the accident, the pick-up van was damaged in three places, viz (1) the front rearside door dented; (2) front rearside bumper dented; and (3) rearside wing mirror dented. It must therefore follow that the point of impact was at a spot before the spot marked `X`. The position of the van as shown in the sketch plan merely showed its position after and not before the collision. The van had come to a stop after the collision but it is a scientific fact that no moving force like a motor vehicle in motion can stop dead unless it meets an irresistable force, even if its brakes are 100% effective. The second plaintiff`s marking should have been rejected as an obvious error. It follows that the second plaintiff`s description that the collision was a head to side collision was consistent with the objective evidence. In fact, and this was also ignored by the district judge, the defendant in his police report had also, like the second plaintiff, made a tick against the printed description `head to side` collision.
On this basis, how did the collision occur? It could only have happened if the van turned into the path of the motorcycle. That this was how the accident occurred was confirmed by all the witnesses including the parties to the action. The question is whether the second plaintiff attempted to overtake the defendant, as found by the district judge, or whether the defendant turned his van suddenly into the entrance of NATC.
In my view, any finding on this is dependent on the relative probabilities of the testimonies of the parties and their witnesses in the light of such other objective evidence as may be relevant. At the entrance to NATC, the width of the three-lane road was 3.90m. The width of the van was 1.60m. The motorcycle was not measured but its width must have been one to two feet. If, as was alleged by the defendant`s witness, the van had been travelling in the centre of the left lane all the way from Jalan lbrahim up to the point of collision, that would leave to a vehicle following the van a free passageway between the curb of the road and the van of about 1.15m. Therefore, if the second plaintiff had been trying to overtake the van, he was doing an extremely hazardous and reckless act. There is no basis for coming to this conclusion. If he had wanted to overtake, it would have been easier and safer to overtake on one of the other two outer lanes.
However, the district judge in effect came to this conclusion by finding that the defendant was travelling on his innermost left lane because the second plaintiff had stated in his police report that prior to the accident, he was travelling behind the van. This inference is not irresistible. If X says that he is travelling on the left lane behind Y who says that he is travelling on the left lane, both X and Y would be travelling on the left lane if both are found to be telling the truth. In this case, the second plaintiff testified that the defendant was travelling in the centre lane. The defendant, of course, denied this and said that he was travelling on the left lane. But, the district judge made no finding as to who was telling the truth. He merely inferred from these two statements that both the second plaintiff and the defendant were travelling on the same lane.
Now, of course, the word `behind` is ambiguous when used to describe, without more, a vehicle following another vehicle on a road with more than one lane going in the same direction. In the present case, it was used by an English speaking constable in interpreting the words of the second plaintiff spoken in a different language. In court, the second plaintiff had explained what he meant when he testified that he was behind the van which was travelling in the centre lane. There is no inconsistency between this statement and what he had said in his police report. The district judge should have made a finding as to where the defendant was travelling just before the collision.
What then was the probability, on the evidence of the defendant having been travelling on the innermost left lane as he had alleged? Here, the district judge has failed to take into account the evidence of the defendant on a related point. The defendant admitted that when he looked at the rear mirror he never saw the motorcycle. There are only two possible reasons to explain why he did not see the motorcycle. The first is that he never looked into the rear mirror at all before turning. The second is that he looked but since the motorcycle was travelling on his left, he could not see the second plaintiff. If the first explanation is correct, the defendant was lying. If the second explanation is correct, the more probable inference would be that the defendant was then travelling on the centre lane and the second plaintiff on the inner lane. That would explain why the defendant never saw the motorcycle. In my view, that is certainly a more probable explanation than to infer that the second plaintiff was doing a dangerous act by riding side by side the defendant`s motorvan and trying to overtake the defendant.
For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the correct inference to draw from the evidence was that, on a balance of probabilities, the defendant had suddenly swerved left from the middle lane into the entrance of NATC and caused the second plaintiff to collide into the van. In my view, the defendant was in breach of r 74 of the Highway Code. He was wholly to blame for the accident.
The appeal is allowed with costs here and below. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs. As the trial judge has not assessed damages, I remit the case back to him for such assessment.

     REGINA v Leanne Maree MOORE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1Â Â Â  NEWMAN J: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence passed by her Honour Judge Latham DCJ at the Campbelltown District Court on 11 February this year. 
     
      
    2Â Â Â  Before her Honour the respondent maintained a plea of guilty which she had first made on 4 August 1999 to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug; namely, methylamphetamine in that she had in her possession an amount of the drug which was not less than the trafficable quantity. Her plea first recorded on 4 August 1999, was not a plea made at the first available opportunity. 
     
      
    3Â Â Â  Her plea on 4 August 1999 was on a day when her matter was set down for trial. I shall revert to the significance of the timing of the plea later in my reasons. 
     
      
    4Â Â Â  The charge was laid pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. The maximum penalty is fifteen years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. It follows that the crime in question is one which has significant standing in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    5Â Â Â  Together with the charge of supply prohibited drug the respondent asked her Honour to take into account two counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm. This her Honour did. In the event, her Honour sentenced the respondent to a Community Service Attendance Order of some thirty-six hours. 
     
      
    6Â Â Â  The Crown's prime submission is that the sentence imposed by her Honour is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7Â Â Â  The facts of the matter are in relatively short compass. As a consequence of investigations carried out, police executed a search warrant at premises at number 9 Billikin Way, Ambarvale, at which premises the respondent resided. At the time when police made entry to the premises they found the respondent home and also, on entering, they came across a gentleman by the name of Mark Gardner who was engaged in the use of a computer in the premises. 
     
      
    8Â Â Â  A search carried out by police discovered methylamphetamine together with paraphernalia not inconsistent with drug dealing. The amount of methylamphetamine found weighed 53.9 grams, in one bag, and .07 grams in another bag. Later analysis showed that the pure quantity of methylamphetamine in the bag containing 53.9 grams was of a much lesser weight. 
     
      
    9Â Â Â  However, the New South Wales statute, unlike that of the equivalent statute of the Commonwealth, deals with weight in admixture and not in pure weight. The weight of drug found took it squarely within the bounds of s 25(1) as being an amount not less than a trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    10Â Â Â  In a record of interview carried out by police shortly after the apprehension of the respondent she admitted that she had supplied the drug to a friend on an occasion. The scales which were found which, as I have said, are part of the paraphernalia of drug dealing, she claimed she used for weighing aspirin. 
     
      
    11Â Â Â  I might say that the scepticism of this excuse advanced by the Crown before this Court this morning is a scepticism perhaps which could be easily shared. 
     
      
    12Â Â Â  Be that as it may, the plea of guilty in the circumstances was one which overcame some difficulties which the Crown may have had in proving its case. The prime difficulty which I would point to is the fact that at the time of her apprehension there was another adult in the house, the gentleman Gardner, and it may well be that in the course of the trial the Crown may have had some difficulty in establishing that it was the respondent rather than Gardner who was the person guilty of supply. 
     
      
    13Â Â Â  Having said that, there are a number of features in her Honour's sentence which cause disquiet. The Crown rightly submitted that her Honour made no reference to either general or personal deterrence in her sentence. 
     
      
    14Â Â Â  This Court has, on many occasions, indicated that in cases of drug supply, questions of both general and personal deterrence are matters which the Court should take into account: see Regina v Clark, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 15 March 1990, as an example of this Court's attitude towards deterrence in drug matters. 
     
      
    15Â Â Â  Secondly, her Honour, in delivering her reasons, clearly stated that she was giving maximum weight in terms of mitigation to the respondent's plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16Â Â Â  While it would be appropriate for her Honour to have given weight of some significance to the plea of guilty, to give full weight to a plea of guilty where that plea was not made at the earliest opportunity, in my view, is a matter of error. Here when the plea was entered on 4 August 1999 the case was set down for trial. Expense, no doubt, had been incurred in arranging witnesses to be present and other matters of preparation for trial which necessarily involved the expenditure of public funds. Indeed, the fact that the plea was not made at the first available opportunity is contra-indicative of absolute contrition. 
     
      
    17Â Â Â  Having said that, it would have been appropriate for her Honour to have taken the plea of guilty into account by way of mitigation but not to give that plea the weight she did. 
     
      
    18Â Â Â  The Crown also relied upon a submission that the respondent, by her statement in the record of interview that the scales found on the premises were used for the weighing of aspirin, is an indication of lack of contrition. As I have indicated earlier, the only admission made by the respondent which went directly to supply was the fact that she conceded to police that she had in fact supplied the subject drug to a friend. 
     
      
    19Â Â Â  Her Honour was greatly influenced, as she made transparently clear in her reasons, by the respondent's personal circumstances. A report from a cardiologist indicated that the respondent is suffering from a very profound cardiological condition, so profound that the morbidity rate flowing from that condition is in the order of twenty per cent a year. It is also very disabling, so disabling that in a pre-sentence report it stated that her physical condition would prevent her carrying out work under a Community Service Work Order. 
     
      
    20Â Â Â  This induced her Honour to make an order of a Community Service Attendance Centre Order which, of course, means that the respondent is not required to carry out any work in the discharge of her obligations under that order. 
     
      
    21Â Â Â  Also her family circumstances were of importance to her Honour. The respondent has children. One of those children is, regrettably, under notice by police and care of those children is a matter of some conjecture should the respondent be incarcerated. 
     
      
    22Â Â Â  For myself, I am of the view that her Honour perhaps overstated the situation when she said, in sentencing: 
     
      
       
        
        But for her health condition and her genuine contrition, I would have imposed a sentence of periodic detention."" 
        
       
      
    23Â Â Â  I am of the view that the sentence passed is inadequate. However, having regard to the medical condition of the respondent and the principles of double jeopardy, I am of the view that this is a case where the court should exercise its discretion and dismiss the appeal.

Yong Pung HowÂ CJ:
1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This was an appeal from the decision of the district judge when she convicted the appellant on four charges. Of these four charges, one charge related to an offence of cheating, punishable under sÂ 417 of the Penal Code (CapÂ 224, 1985Â Rev Ed) (â€œPCâ€). The other three charges related to the appellantâ€™s failure to submit changes of particulars to the Registrar of Companies and Businesses, as required under sÂ 12(1) of the Business Registration Act (CapÂ 32, 2001Â Rev Ed) (â€œBRAâ€) (an offence punishable under sÂ 23(b) BRA). Additionally, two charges for a breach of sÂ 12(1) BRA were taken into consideration and one charge for an offence of cheating punishable under sÂ 420 PC was withdrawn. The appellant was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on this withdrawn charge. The appellant was sentenced to 12 monthsâ€™ imprisonment and forfeiture of his computer in relation to the cheating charge and fined $4,000 for each of the three BRA charges, in default of which four weeksâ€™ imprisonment per charge would be imposed. The appellant appealed only against the imprisonment sentence imposed in respect of the cheating charge. At the end of the hearing, I allowed the appeal and reduced the term of imprisonment to six months. I now give my reasons.
The facts
2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant (â€œSunilâ€) had downloaded the website of Power & Motion Control Pte Ltd (â€œPMCâ€) onto his own website, EconSingapore. This was a fact unknown to PMC and the victim, one Kevyan-Alf, a managing director of M/sÂ Kevyan-Alf & Co, a company based in Tehran, Iran. Sometime in December 2002, Kevyan-Alf placed an order for Vickers Cartridge Kits through the website of PMC. However, Sunil was able to access Kevyan-Alfâ€™s order form. He used the particulars from Kevyan-Alfâ€™s order form to correspond with Kevyan-Alf. Sunil falsely represented to Kevyan-Alf that his company, the fictitious Universal Computers, was an agent of the sole distributor of Vickers products in Singapore and that he would be able to supply the Vickers Cartridge Kits for the sum of US$42,000 (equivalent to S$73,428.60).
3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Kevyan-Alf agreed to Sunilâ€™s representation and transferred the sum of US$42,000 to Sunilâ€™s Standard Chartered Foreign Currency Account 
via
 telegraphic transfer. However, Sunil did not deliver the Vickers Cartridge Kits.
4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sunilâ€™s scam was discovered and he was charged for committing an offence of cheating. Sunil pleaded guilty to the charge at an open court hearing before the district judge on 8Â October 2003. He entered a plea in mitigation on 10Â October 2003. The mitigation focused on the fact that Sunil had made full restitution prior to pleading guilty, had pleaded guilty and was a first offender. The Prosecution, however, contended that the amount of money involved was large, that the victim was a foreigner and that a sophisticated scheme was employed.
The decision below
5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The district judge imposed the maximum imprisonment sentence of 12 months under sÂ 417 PC. In deciding on the sentence, the district judge took three factors into account. First, she agreed that Sunil had employed a sophisticated scheme that involved a degree of planning and information technology (â€œITâ€) skill to commit the offence. This, the district judge found, was an aggravating factor.
6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Second, the district judge noted that the amount involved was large. In this regard, she noted that the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated, the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court. She relied on the holding in the case of 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
 in arriving at this conclusion.
7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Third, and, as the district judge emphasised, most importantly, the offence involved the misuse of the Internet environment. The district judge expressed concern that the Internet was a particularly open and vulnerable platform where crimes were easy to commit, but their detection and investigation difficult. The district judge referred to the case of 
Tay Kim Kuan v PP
 
[2001] 3Â SLR 567
 when she made this point.
8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Additionally, the district judge emphasised that commerce on the Internet required special protection as a growing and lucrative medium of business. She opined that as Singapore developed as a global commercial centre, it was vital that the e-commerce environment was kept secure and that breaches were viewed with seriousness. In respect of this point, the district judge relied on 
dicta
 in 
PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 
[2000] 1Â SLR 34
. That case involved a young respondent who had hacked into computer systems. In emphasising the need for a sentence that reflected the objective of general deterrence, I had stated in that case that the anti-social conduct displayed by the respondent in 
Muhammad Nuzaihan
 not only undermined public and international confidence in the commercial integrity and viability of our computer systems, but also gravely compromised Singaporeâ€™s efforts to position itself as a global e-commerce hub. The district judge censured Sunilâ€™s conduct in this regard, and emphasised that he had damaged the reputation and standing of PMC by his deception.
9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Finally, the district judge stated that the mitigating factors brought up by Sunil had to be balanced against considerations of public interest. She stated that public interest, in this case, involved the need to deter other like-minded individuals who may be tempted to subvert the e-commerce environment. Additionally, there was a need to signal to the international commercial community that the Internet environment was an important medium for business, the safety and security of which was jealously guarded by the local courts. In this regard, the district judge held that the maximum imprisonment sentence of 12 months was necessary and sentenced Sunil accordingly.
10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In imposing this maximum sentence, the district judge relied on the judgment in 
Sim Gek Yong v PP
 
[1995] 1Â SLR 537
. There, I had stated that the court ought to impose a maximum sentence whenever the nature of the offence and the circumstances so warranted it, as opposed to restricting such sentences to the â€œworst case imaginableâ€. In this respect, a range of conduct had to be identified and the maximum sentence would be imposed on the most serious instances of the offence in question.
Sunilâ€™s appeal against sentence
11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Essentially, Sunil made several points in contending that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. He appealed for the imprisonment sentence of 12 months to be substituted with a fine, or in the alternative, with a short custodial sentence and a fine. I observed each of Sunilâ€™s arguments and dealt with them accordingly.
Argument 1:Â Â  Sunil had made full restitution, showing remorse.
Argument 2:Â Â  This was a one-off offence and not a series of offences in which a public institution had been deceived.
Argument 3:Â Â  Sunil had no antecedents.
12Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Here, Sunil argued that the district judge had not fully appreciated or given sufficient consideration to the various mitigating factors he had raised at trial. However, I noted that the district judge had indeed taken into account the fact that Sunil had made full restitution, had no antecedents and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The district judge had also emphasised that such mitigating factors were to be balanced against considerations of public interest.
13Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is true that from the district judgeâ€™s grounds of decision alone, it was difficult to identify the weight that had been attached to the fact that Sunil had made full restitution and had no antecedents. The district judge had mentioned these mitigating factors in passing when she balanced them against the specified considerations of public interest. To that extent, the grounds of decision were not highly elaborate. However, a lack of elaboration, without more, did not mean that the district judge had not considered these mitigating factors when arriving at her decision. To that extent, I disagreed with Sunilâ€™s suggestions.
14Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As for the point that the offence was one-off and that a public institution was not deceived, the trial notes of evidence and the written plea in mitigation (prepared for the trial) did not indicate that this point was brought up at the time of the trial. As such, Sunilâ€™s argument that the district judge did not give this point sufficient consideration was not tenable. Instead, I found that the district judge had probably already given sufficient consideration to this fact among others when she engaged in the balancing exercise between the mitigating factors pleaded and the specified public interest considerations.
15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At this juncture, it is necessary to understand that it would not be plausible to expect a judge to lay out every possible mitigating factor on the facts, especially where these factors were not argued by an appellant (or an accused for that matter). This would be tantamount to expecting a judge to function as defence counsel for a represented accused. Accordingly, I rejected Sunilâ€™s arguments in this regard.
Argument 4:Â Â  The district judge had placed undue reliance on the fact that the offence â€œwas a fairly sophisticated one which took a degree of planning and IT skillâ€. This was a case of simple deception and nothing more.
Argument 5:Â Â  The district judge had placed too much emphasis on the fact that the offence involved the misuse of the Internet environment.
Argument 6:Â Â  Although the offence was committed by the misuse of the Internet, the nature of the offence committed by its misuse was not one in which detection and investigation were difficult.
Argument 7:Â Â  The district judge had misapplied the dicta in the cases of Tay Kim Kuan
 
and Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin.
16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I have provided a summary of the appellantâ€™s next four arguments in the headings above. When I considered these arguments in total, I found that Sunil had a credible case. It is true that a substantial part of the district judgeâ€™s decision revolved around her opinion on the manner in which the cheating offence took place â€“ the district judge had placed heavy emphasis on the fact that this case involved the misuse of the Internet environment. However, on the facts, I found that this case was essentially one of cheating 
simpliciter
 in accordance with the meaning of cheating as attributed to it in sÂ 415 PC.
17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It was clear that Sunil had used the information he had gathered from Kevyan-Alfâ€™s order form (submitted to the PMC website) in order to cheat Kevyan-Alf. There was evidence that there was further correspondence between Sunil and Kevyan-Alf before the telegraphic transfer of the US$42,000. At most, Sunilâ€™s act of downloading the PMC website into his own website was incidental to the commission of the offence of cheating, as opposed to being a substantial aspect of the offence itself. There was no evidence to show that Sunil had downloaded the PMC website in order to cheat Kevyan-Alf.
18Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is probable, however, that Sunil had performed the initial download with an intention to commit some form of offence at some later point. However, the Prosecution did not prove this. In fact, the charge itself did not state the fact of misuse of the Internet environment or the downloading of the PMC website in its particularisation of the offence committed. I replicate the charge below:
DAC 043538/2003:
You, Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil M/45 yrs old NRIC No: S2170627-B date of birth: 9-6-1958 are charged that you, sometime in the month of December 2002, in Singapore and elsewhere, did cheat one Kevyan-Alf, a Managing Director of M/sÂ Kevyan-Alf & Co, a company based in Tehran, Iran into believing that you are able to supply his company with new genuine Vickers Cartridge Kits, when you knew it was not true, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Kevyan-Alf to remit a sum of USD$42,000 (equivalent to Singapore Dollar $73,428.60) by means of telegraphic transfer to your Standard Chartered Foreign Currency Account, at No: 370 Alexandra Road, Singapore, which the said Kevyan-Alf would not have done had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence of cheating punishable under SectionÂ 417 of the Penal Code, ChapterÂ 224.
20Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Additionally, I was unable to entirely agree with the district judgeâ€™s opinion on the level of sophistication of the Internet misuse involved. There was no evidence that there was a high level of IT skill and planning involved behind the downloading of the PMC website. Without more, I could not conclude that Sunilâ€™s act was as sophisticated as the district judge had made it out to be.
21Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Further, the district judgeâ€™s opinion on the difficulty of detection and investigation resulting from Internet misuse was not a crucial point to a decision on the charge. At most, difficulty in detection and investigation could be an aggravating factor against an accused. However, in this case, as Sunil had argued, the offence was one of simple deception. Detection and investigation would therefore not have been as difficult as made out by the district judge because Sunil had actually communicated directly with Kevyan-Alf.
22Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sunil had also argued that the district judge had misapplied the 
dicta
 in the cases of 
Tay Kim Kuan
 and 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
. Although I disagreed that there was misapplication of 
dicta
 on the part of the district judge, I found that she had overstated the point regarding Internet misuse. Although the district judgeâ€™s application of the 
dicta
 with regard to a general issue of Internet misuse was accurate, the 
reasoning
 behind the decision in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 and 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 may not have been applicable on the facts of this appeal.
23Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Tay Kim Kuan
 involved an appellant who had sexual intercourse with an underaged girl whom he had met over the Internet. There, a deterrent sentence was imposed on the appellant. Although that case involved a misuse of Internet resources in the commission of a crime, the reasoning behind the deterrent sentence there was the protection of the young and gullible from the perils of the Internet, in the form of unscrupulous people who hid their true identities and remained faceless while boldly preying on such young people.
24Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This was not the prevailing concern in the present appeal. Although, on the facts, a misuse of the Internet environment had occurred, the concerns here were different from those in 
Tay Kim Kuan
. This appeal involved an offence of cheating and not of sex abuse facilitated by Internet use. As such, the reasoning in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 ran at a tangent to that in this appeal. Although some of the 
Tay Kim Kuan
 issues involving Internet abuse was useful in order to understand the stance courts would take in pure Internet misuse cases, this same stance should not be applied 
carte blanche
 in every instance where an Internet or computer resource is misused, without first looking at the role such misuse played in the commission of the offence in question. In this appeal, the role of such misuse was peripheral. As such, the reasoning in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 cannot be applied directly to the set of facts in this appeal.
25Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Likewise, the case of 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 involved a breach of ssÂ 3(1), 5(1) and 6(1)(a) of the Computer Misuse Act (CapÂ 50A, 1998Â Rev Ed). The offences committed by the respondent in that case involved unauthorised access to computer materials, unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer and unauthorised access to a computer service. A comparison of the facts of 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 and the current appeal clearly disclosed a large disparity in the nature of the offences committed. 
Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 involved pure computer misuse, as opposed to the cheating offence in this appeal.
26Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As such, I found that the district judge, although not wrong in emphasising the need to control Internet misuse by imposing deterrent sentences in the appropriate cases, had over-emphasised the fact of Internet misuse in this instance. Therefore, the reasoning process towards her decision adopted conclusions and considerations from cases that were not directly applicable here. As a result, her decision did not take into account the fact that this was a case of pure cheating, with the slight involvement of Internet misuse along the way. As such, I found that although the district judge was correct in convicting Sunil on the charge, she had imposed a sentence that was manifestly excessive.
27Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Having found that there were sufficient reasons for me to alter the sentence that had been imposed on Sunil, I also noted that Sunil had pleaded for the 12-month imprisonment sentence to be substituted with a fine. I could not allow this plea. In some cases, a particular sentence is deemed appropriate in order to relay a particular message. To state the obvious, a sentence should never relay a message that would suggest that it would be worthwhile to commit a crime. For instance, such a situation could arise if the punishment imposed were not sufficient in its severity to deter future similar offences.
28Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Likewise, when a court is faced with a charge of cheating involving a sum of money akin to that in this appeal, it has to impose a sentence that has the potential to deter future similar offences. In that respect, a fine, though appropriate in other situations, would not have a deterrent effect in cases that are similar to this appeal. A potential offender should never be afforded the opportunity to ponder that he could cheat others of large sums of money and still â€œget away lightlyâ€ by being fined up to only a certain statutory limit. The criminal law should never become a â€œbusinessâ€ of sorts.
29Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At this juncture, I felt it would be useful to refer to the case of 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3Â SLR 927
. That case involved cheating on a company share transaction. In that case, I rejected the appellantâ€™s plea for a fine instead of a custodial sentence and mentioned the following at 928â€“929:
In my view, fines instead of custodial sentences can be imposed where the amounts involved are not of great magnitude or consequence, but when the operation smacks of something on a considerable scale, a custodial sentence must necessarily follow. â€¦ I think it should also be remembered that prosecutions for such offences normally take place in the district courts in which a district judgeâ€™s power to fine is presently limited to only $10,000. People who are minded to commit such offences of multiple share applications on a substantial scale must be discouraged from thinking that, if they are caught, they can simply surrender their ill-gotten gains and the worst that will then happen to them will be a fine of $10,000. For them, there must now be a custodial sentence.
30Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I think the reasoning in 
Lim Choon Kang
 would apply in this appeal as well. As such, I felt that it was appropriate for a custodial sentence to be imposed on Sunil. I was left to decide on the length of this term of imprisonment. For the reasons I have stated, I found that a 12-month imprisonment sentence was manifestly excessive. As such, having regard to the circumstances in this case, especially the sum of money involved and the manner in which the offence was committed, I found that an imprisonment sentence of six months would be more appropriate.
31Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I accordingly allowed the appeal on sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment from 12 months to six months. Sunil also requested for this imprisonment term of six months to commence after the Chinese New Year holidays. He mentioned that his wife was Chinese and that he wished to be with his family during the festive holidays. I saw no adverse reasons to disallow him some time with his family. I extended his bail and allowed the sentence to commence on 26Â January 2004.

I have also considered the aspects that need to be taken into account with regard to a grant of leave by way of s 192 of the Evidence Act.  Without running through each of those seriatim, I consider that those factors as a whole argue in favour of the application being granted.    3Furthermore, I regard the evidence of what the accused allegedly said in Livingston Avenue on the afternoon of 20 June 2011, in particular with regard to alleged threats of retaliations, as highly probative.   4In the circumstances, I do not see any basis upon which, by way of any discretion, the procedure pursuant to s 32 should not be permitted.  5In short, having taken into account ss 32, 55, 137, and 192 of the Evidence Act, I propose to grant the Crown leave to have the witness use voir dire exhibit BB in an attempt to revive his memory in the witness box.

The two appellants had on 25 March 1991 pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
You, Er Boon Huai and Lai Ah Kau, are charged that between 11.45am and 11.55am on 27 April 1988, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by transporting three packets containing a total of not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine in motor car PBE 9696 from the carpark at Block 75, Pipit Road, to the carpark serving Blocks 54 and 76, Pipit Road, via Circuit Road, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
They admitted the facts outlined by the prosecution and were convicted. The first appellant, Er Boon Huai, who was 33 years of age, was sentenced to 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The second appellant, Lai Ah Kau, who on the date of the conviction was 50 years and nine months old, was sentenced to 27 years` imprisonment. They now appeal against the sentences imposed.
The facts that gave rise to the offence were that on 25 April 1988, the second appellant telephoned the first appellant and told him that he had a buyer for three pounds of heroin at $6,400 per pound. The first appellant made the necessary arrangements with his supplier and told the second appellant that he would deliver the three pounds to the second appellant on 27 April 1988.
At about 11am on 27 April 1988, the first appellant collected the three pounds of heroin from near Beauty World in Bukit Timah area and drove to Pipit Road. He parked his car near Block 75, Pipit Road, and went up to the flat at Block 75, #09-227, where the second appellant was waiting. The buyer arrived at the flat shortly thereafter and left after speaking with the second appellant. The second appellant told the first appellant that the buyer had told him that he would collect the diamorphine later and had asked the second appellant to keep the diamorphine until collection.
The two appellants then went to where the first appellant`s car was parked. Rather than take the drugs from where the car was parked, the two drove off, went into Circuit Road, then returned to Pipit Road and stopped at the car park serving Blocks 54 and 76. The second appellant then took a brown plastic bag containing three bundles of the drug and went to the flat at Block 75, #09-227.
The first appellant drove off but was intercepted and arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau. Other officers raided the flat at Block 75, #09-227, arrested the second appellant, searched the flat and seized the brown plastic bag containing the three bundles that the second appellant had earlier been carrying. The contents of the three bundles on analysis by the Department of Scientific Services were confirmed to be diamorphine with a total weight of just under 255g.
The first appellant, in support of his appeal, told the court that he was remorseful and would never commit the offence again. He urged the court to show leniency. The second appellant told the court that he committed the offence because he was himself a drug addict and needed money. He told the court that he was a sick man and was undergoing treatment for hypertension and heart problems. In view of his age and medical condition he urged the court to reduce the term of imprisonment imposed on him.
The punishment prescribed by law for this offence was a maximum of 30 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a minimum of 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Bearing in mind the quantity of drugs involved and the minimum and maximum sentences prescribed by law, the sentence of 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on the first appellant could not be said to be manifestly excessive. We therefore dismissed the appeal by the first appellant.
The second appellant was over 50 years of age when he was convicted for this offence. In view of his age, he could not, by virtue of s 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), be punished with caning. The learned trial judge in sentencing the second appellant took the provisions of s 231 into account and imposed an additional three years` of imprisonment on the second appellant in lieu of the caning. This is evident from his grounds of judgment where the learned trial judge states: 
 
Lai, having passed the age of 50 when he appeared before me, was not liable to caning and in view of this, I felt an additional three years of imprisonment was justified and I accordingly sentenced him to 27 years` imprisonment.
 
 
 
Section 231 reads as follows: 
 
No sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments and none of the following persons shall be punishable with caning:
 
 
 
 
(a) women; 
 
(b) males sentenced to death; 
 
(c) males whom the court considers to be more than 50 years of age.
  
 
 
Section 231 places the three categories of persons stated therein in a special position in that any provision in any law imposing a liability to caning would not be applicable to such persons. That being so, unlike the first appellant, the maximum penalty that the second appellant was liable for was therefore 30 years` imprisonment (without any caning) and the minimum penalty was 20 years` imprisonment (without any caning). The additional three years` imprisonment imposed on the second appellant in lieu of the caning cannot be justified as the second appellant, in the absence of any facts to distinguish his case from that of the first appellant`s, must be sentenced to the same term of imprisonment as the first appellant for this offence.
We allowed the appeal against sentence by the second appellant and set aside the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this case, we considered that a term of imprisonment of 24 years from the date of his arrest would be the appropriate sentence to impose on the second appellant and we so ordered.
 Order accordingly

     Regina v Nedjelko Bikic 
      
       
     No: 70204/99 
    Judgment: on application for a separate trial (ex-tempore)1Â Â Â Â  HIS HONOUR: Mr Bikic has made a further application for a separate trial, and after careful consideration, I have determined that it must be granted. 
     
      
       
      
    2Â Â Â Â  A number of grounds were advanced in support of the application. However, I consider only one of them to be of substance: that is, the ground that he anticipates that his co-accused would support his alibi and he would wish to have them available as witnesses at his trial. That was the only ground argued at the time of the initial application which I determined on 1 December 1999. At that stage, however, no alibi notice had been filed and it was by no means clear what the nature of Mr Bikic's defence would be and in what manner his co-accused might support it. Since then notice of alibi has been filed and this application has been pursued accordingly. 
     
      
       
      
    3Â Â Â Â  The material before me is to the effect that Mr Bikic would claim at his trial that he was not present at the scene of the shooting or, indeed, at other places earlier in that day when other relevant events are said to have occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    4Â Â Â Â  I am informed that four of his co-accused have made statements, the effect of which is that, while they were present at least at the time of the shootings, if not at the time of earlier events, Mr Bikic was not. Those four co-accused, as I have said, have provided statements which were presented to me for the purpose of this application in sealed envelopes. Senior counsel for Mr Bikic submitted that I should examine that material in the sealed envelopes to determine the genuineness of this application but that the Crown should either have no access to them or should have access on a limited basis only: that is, on the basis that the material could not be used in the course of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    5Â Â Â Â  I do not consider it appropriate to examine the material in the sealed envelopes on either of those bases. It seems to me that, if that material is to be relied upon, it must be available to the Crown for all purposes as any other material tendered would be. That said, however, I have the assurance from the Bar table of senior counsel representing Mr Bikic that those statements reveal that each of those four co-accused is prepared to give evidence for Mr Bikic in circumstances where he himself is not placed in jeopardy, and that that evidence would tend to support Mr Bikic's case. Obviously, what weight the evidence might have is a matter I am not in a position to determine and which need not be determined at this interlocutory stage. 
     
      
       
      
    6Â Â Â Â  I observed when I dealt with the original application for separate trials that it is curious that there appears to be no reported cases in Australia dealing with situations such as this. I am indebted to the research that the Crown Prosecutor has undertaken since I made that observation, which confirms there is no reported case in Australia on this topic. The nearest one gets is an obiter observation in The Queen v Harbach [1973] 6 SASR 427 at 435 to the effect that the desire of one accused to call evidence from another might be a proper basis for directing a separate trial. 
     
      
       
      
    7Â Â Â Â  I was also referred to R v Knijff (1982) QdR 429, which dealt with the situation where the wife of the appellantâ€™s co-accused was called but, as she was not a compellable witness against the co-accused, cross-examination of her by counsel for the appellant was hampered. In that unusual situation the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a separate trial was called for. The facts of that case, of course, are significantly different from here. 
     
      
       
      
    8Â Â Â Â  It is to Canada where one must turn for some guidance for the situation which confronts me. The Crown Prosecutor referred me to three decisions from that country. In the first, R v Quiring and Kuipers (1974) 19 CCC (2d) 337, the court held that a separate trial had been rightly refused in circumstances where it had been sought on the basis of the appellant's assertion that his co-accused might give material evidence in his defence. It seems, however, there was no material to establish that that co-accused was prepared to give evidence nor, if he were, what that evidence might be. The court recognised that a desire of one accused to call another in his defence might ground an order for separate trials but found that there was no such basis demonstrated in that case. 
     
      
       
      
    9Â Â Â Â  In R v Agawa and Mallet (1975) 28 CCC (2d) 379 the appellants had been found guilty of a killing in a prison. Agawa had sought a separate trial on the basis that Mallet made a statement to police tending to implicate himself in the killing but to exculpate Agawa. However, he made the statement with the rider that, ""if any of this is said outside, I will deny it"". A separate trial was refused and, on appeal, held rightly so. As the court pointed out, it was not clear what evidence Mallet would have given if he had been called and, in any event, his preparedness to give evidence on behalf of Agawa appeared to be no more than a mere possibility in the light of the rider he made at the time of his statement to the police. 
     
      
       
      
    10Â Â Â Â  On that occasion the court had regard to the strength of the Crown case against Agawa and concluded that anything Mallet might have said would have been of very little weight. The court appeared to have considered that that was a proper matter to assess in determining the separate trial application. However, it must be borne in mind that, in any event, this was a case on appeal after conviction where the court was also examining, with the benefit of hindsight, whether the trial had miscarried having proceeded as a joint trial. 
     
      
       
      
    11Â Â Â Â  On the other hand, in R v Boulet (1987) 40 CCC (3d) 38 a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that a separate trial should have been granted. In that case the appellant was tried with three others for the murder of a prison guard in the course of a riot. It seems that the appellant was initially charged alone and he indicated at a preliminary hearing, before the other three had been charged, that he may wish to call them as witnesses in his case. The Crown case turned primarily on the evidence of another inmate who claimed to have seen the appellant strike the guard. In seeking a separate trial, counsel for the appellant had informed the trial judge that the three co-accused would say that, while they were present at the scene, they had not seen the appellant commit any act of violence against the prison guard. Counsel for the other three accused indicated to the trial judge that anything they might say would not be to the appellant's benefit. Nevertheless, as I have said, the majority of the court were persuaded that, in those circumstances a separate trial should have been granted. 
     
      
       
      
    12Â Â Â Â  Beauregard JA (at 42) said that the trial judge should have accepted and acted upon the statement of counsel for the appellant from the Bar table that the other three accused might have given evidence favouring his case. The other judge in the majority was Vallerand JA, who at 47ff distinguished the two earlier Canadian cases to which I have referred. There is no precise parallel between the case of Boulet and the case with which I am dealing. However, I do find it of some assistance in the determination of this application. 
     
      
       
      
    13Â Â Â Â  The Crownâ€™s opposition to the application is founded primarily on the assertion that the application is not made bona fide. Put bluntly, the Crown said this application is a ploy to improve Mr Bikic's chances of being granted bail. He has previously been unsuccessful on a number of occasions in bail applications. One of those occasions was before Adams J in April of last year. On that occasion his Honour refused bail but added the observation that the question of bail might be viewed differently if it appeared there would be any significant delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial.  
     
      
       
      
    14Â Â Â Â  The Crown submission is that the alibi material is false and has been fashioned simply to give weight to a separate trial application. Obviously, if that application were successful the trial of Mr Bikic would have to proceed after the trial of his co-accused and it is from that, the Crown says, that the sort of delay of which Adams J was speaking may well result. 
     
      
       
      
    15Â Â Â Â  The Crown relies on a number of other matters to impugn the bona fides of this application. On the first application, which I refused, Mr Bikic was represented by a different barrister from senior counsel who has represented him since. The effect of what was said from the Bar table on that occasion was that Mr Bikic would claim an alibi and would be supported by several of his co-accused because they were with him at the place where he claimed to have been at the time of the shooting. Clearly, that is not the case. As I have said, what I have been told is that the co-accused would acknowledge being at the scene but would deny that Mr Bikic was there. 
     
      
       
      
    16Â Â Â Â  However, in this application I have the affidavit of the solicitor who was previously acting for the applicant (although he no longer does), the effect of which is that counsel formerly briefed simply misunderstood Mr Bikic's instructions and the solicitor did not see it necessary to point that out to him at the time. Frankly, that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs but that is the situation to which the solicitor has deposed and he was not required for cross-examination on that or any other matter. 
     
      
       
      
    17Â Â Â Â  The Crown also relies upon the fact that the alibi notice was served late and, indeed, only after the judgment in which I refused the previous application for a separate trial. The Crown said that in the investigation by the police thus far the alibi does not appear to be supported. In particular, the Crown draws attention to a statement taken from one of the persons named in the alibi notice which would appear, in some respects at least, to be inconsistent with Mr Bikic's assertions in the alibi notice in respect of his movements on the occasion in question. 
     
      
       
      
    18Â Â Â Â  The Crown relies on what is said to be substantial evidence of Mr Bikic's involvement in the planning and execution of these crimes. Indeed, the Crown says that the evidence points to his being central to the organisation of the enterprise. In particular, there is eye witness evidence which, if accepted, clearly puts Mr Bikic at the scene and at another place earlier where it is said arrangements were made for the execution of the enterprise. 
     
      
       
      
    19Â Â Â Â  I should interpolate at this stage that the Crown also sought to rely in this application upon some evidence which it does not intend to lead at trial. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I could receive that evidence at this interlocutory stage pursuant to s75 of the Evidence Act. I say no more than that I do not consider it appropriate to do so, and I do not think that this is the sort of evidence to which s75 is directed. However, in any event, the outcome of the application would not turn on that material. 
     
      
       
      
    20Â Â Â Â  The Crown pointed out that part of its case is that Mr Bikic himself shot one of the victims, and the Crown Prosecutor submitted that his absence from the joint trial would distort the Crown case. The jury would not have the opportunity of seeing the totality of the case, including any answer that Mr Bikic might make to the evidence led against him. Of course, if Mr Bikic were granted a separate trial, the evidence of his having shot one of the victims would still be admissible in the trial of the others. Inevitably, directing a separate trial causes some distortion to the fabric of the Crown case. The question is whether the interests of justice override that. 
     
      
       
      
    21Â Â Â Â  All the matters the Crown Prosecutor raised in opposition to the application are of considerable weight and I have given them very careful thought. One might certainly entertain some suspicion about the true purpose for which this application is being made. As to that I can say only this. If the granting of this application is followed by a further bail application, that application will be dealt with on its merits in the light of the material then presented, although the delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial would be a relevant matter. 
     
      
       
      
    22Â Â Â Â  There are powerful reasons of policy for the joint trial of persons alleged to be involved in a joint criminal enterprise. For that proposition there are numerous authorities which I need not recite. The ultimate question, however, is what the interests of justice require. That involves balancing the interests of the community and the interests of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    23Â Â Â Â  In R v Middis & Ors (unreported 27 March 1991) Hunt J (as he then was) expressed the opinion (at p5):  
     
      
       
        
         
         An applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk (as opposed to a remote possibility) that there will arise in a joint trial prejudice of the type which - if it arises - would result in positive injustice to him. 
         
        
       
      
    24Â Â Â Â  I am presented with the situation in which senior counsel for Mr Bikic tells me that some at least of his co-accused could give evidence material to his defence. Those co-accused would not be compellable to do so at a joint trial. The only way to ensure their availability to Mr Bikic in his defence is to see them dealt with, one way or the other, before he goes to trial. 
     
      
       
      
    25Â Â Â Â  It is true, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, that a separate trial can be granted at any time. If, as it happened, all the co-accused chose to give evidence in a joint trial Mr Bikic's problem might well be solved. However, I have no way of knowing what course the other accused might take at their trial. 
     
      
       
      
    26Â Â Â Â  In all the circumstances, I consider it undesirable to wait until the trial is well under way to determine whether the interests of justice call for Mr Bikic's separate trial. As Hunt J observed in Middis at p6, sometimes in this circumstance it is not sufficient merely to discharge the jury in respect of a particular accused but it is necessary to discharge the jury in respect of the whole trial and to start again. 
     
      
       
      
    27Â Â Â Â  For those reasons I am satisfied that the application must be granted. Accordingly, I direct that Mr Bikic be tried separately from his co-accused and after they have been tried.

Introduction
 
This was an application by Mary Lwee Kwi Ling (â€˜Maryâ€™), pursuant to s 223 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(â€˜CPCâ€™), for the sentence imposed on her by the High Court in MA 146/2002/01 to be suspended until such time as the President of the Republic of Singapore has determined her petition, pursuant to s 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act (â€˜RSIAâ€™), to have her sentence suspended.
Facts
2 Mary was convicted by the magistrate on a charge of criminal intimidation for uttering a death threat at one Quek Chin Huat (â€˜Quekâ€™), while wielding a chopper at him, an offence punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). She was sentenced to 10 weeksâ€™ imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with her sentence, she appealed. On 28 January 2003, I dismissed her appeal and enhanced her sentence to three monthsâ€™ imprisonment. I also granted an application by her counsel for her sentence to commence only after the Lunar New Year Holidays, ie 4 February 2003. Mary had already commenced serving her sentence by the time this motion was heard.
3 Mary took out the present application for her sentence to be suspended, pursuant to s 223 of the CPC, because she intended to petition to the President. The basis of her petition was her discovery, after her appeal was dismissed, that one of the prosecutionâ€™s witnesses, one Kulwant Singh, had given false evidence implicating her in the trial before the magistrate. Kulwant Singh had since signed a statutory declaration admitting that he had been bribed by Quek to say, 
inter alia
, that he saw chopper marks made by Mary on a dining chair and on the door of her apartment, when in fact there were no such marks. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was investigating into the matter.
The issue
4 The issues before me were, first, whether the court had the power to suspend Maryâ€™s sentence pursuant to s 223 of the CPC, and secondly, if the court had the requisite power, whether the power should be exercised in her favour.
The law
5 Section 223 of the CPC reads:
 
Subject to the provision of this Code and of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, every sentence of imprisonment to which section 221 or 222 apply shall take effect from the date on which it was passed, unless the court passing the sentence or when there has been an appeal the appellate court otherwise directs.
 
6 In my view, this section did not support Maryâ€™s application for her sentence to be suspended after she has commenced serving it. The section provides that the court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment should 
commence
 on a date other than the date on which it was passed. In 
Lim Teck Leng Roland v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 4 SLR 61
, I ruled that a sentencing court could entertain an application under s 223 of the CPC for a deferment of the commencement of a sentence it passed even after a decision had been made previously on the commencement date of the sentence. The court was not 
functus officio
 in such a case and could alter its decision in respect of the commencement date of the sentence. This was because an order stipulating the commencement date of a sentence did not amount to a ""judgment"" that was unchangeable. However, once the offender has commenced serving his sentence, it is clear from the words of s 223 of the CPC that the court does not possess the power to re-consider its decision because it can no longer direct that the sentence shall commence on another date. Accordingly, since Mary had already commenced serving her sentence, she could not rely on s 223 of the CPC to defer the commencement of her sentence.
7 The relevant statutory provisions make it clear that the President has the sole prerogative to suspend the execution of a sentence, by virtue of his office. Section 8(1) of the RSIA, which is a constitutional document, reads:
The President, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the Cabinet â€“
a. grant a pardon to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the principal offenders, if more than one;
b. grant to any offender convicted of any offence in any court in Singapore, a pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or respite, either indefinite or for such period as the President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such offender; or
c. remit the whole or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed by law.
8 In recognition of this, s 237(1) of the CPC also provides the power for the suspension by the President of the execution of any sentence imposed by a court. That sub-section reads:
 
When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an offence, the President, acting in accordance with section 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act may at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which he has been sentenced.
 
9 Parliament, by these two provisions, granted the power to suspend the execution of a sentence only to the President. As a matter of constitutional law, the suspension of sentences are not part of the courtâ€™s functions and the court cannot usurp the prerogative of the President conferred by statute.
10 The Court of Appeal in 
Jabar v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 1 SLR 617
 also arrived at the same conclusion that the President, and not the courts, may exercise the powers under s 8(1) of the RSIA, although that decision was with respect to the power to order a stay of execution. The facts of the case were as follows: One Jabar, was convicted on a charge of murder with two others and sentenced to death. On appeal, his conviction was upheld. He petitioned to the President for clemency but the petition was rejected. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Jabar sought a stay of execution from the President when his co-accused claimed that he was solely liable for the murder. The stay was granted and Jabar filed a further petition for clemency. However, this petition was subsequently rejected as well. On the eve of the re-scheduled execution, Jabar filed an application to the High Court seeking a stay of execution of the death sentence on the basis that the execution was unconstitutional due to the prolonged delay in executing the sentence. The High Court dismissed the application. The President ordered a respite pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal which ruled that the courts did not have the power to order a stay of execution. At p 632C of the report, the court held that s 8(1) of the RSIA gave the President the exclusive power to order a stay of execution. Therefore, the court did not possess the power to do so. By this interpretation of s 8(1), the courts similarly do not have the power to order a suspension of the execution of a sentence as that sub-section only gives the President such a power.
Conclusion
11 As the court did not possess the power to suspend the execution of Maryâ€™s sentence, it was unnecessary for me to consider whether the circumstances of this case warranted a suspension of the sentence. Accordingly, I dismissed the motion. I noted that Mary was not left without recourse and the proper mechanism for her to seek a suspension of the execution of her sentence was to petition directly to the President pursuant to s 8(1) of the RSIA.",27/2/2003 0:00,SG High Court

    Thursday, 21 October 1999 
     
     REGINA v LEE WEST  
      
    Reasons for judgment3Â Â Â Â  HIDDEN J: The appellant, Lee West, was tried in the District Court with another man upon an indictment containing two charges: (1) robbery with corporal violence at the St George Bank at Ramsgate on 5 December 1997; and (2) on the same day, knowingly being carried in a Holden Commodore sedan which had been taken without its ownerâ€™s consent.  
     
      
       
       He was found guilty of both charges and custodial sentences were imposed. He appeals against conviction only. 
        
        
       The evidence 
        
       
      
    4Â Â Â Â  In the early afternoon of Friday, 5 December 1997 two men entered the St George Bank at Ramsgate Road, Ramsgate. One remained in the customer area while the other jumped over the counter, struck one of the tellers and seized a sum of money. The two men left the bank and were seen to drive away in the vehicle the subject of the second count, which was parked nearby and in which someone already occupied the driverâ€™s seat. 
     
      
       
      
    5Â Â Â Â  The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant and his co-accused had been correctly identified as the men involved in the robbery. The appellant was said to be the man who had remained in the customer area of the bank. The witnesses to the robbery and the escape of the two men were shown arrays of photographs prepared by the police on video-tape. One of the tellers identified a photograph of the co-accused as the man who had jumped over the counter. Otherwise, none of the witnesses could identify either of the two men. However, the robbery was filmed by a bank security camera, and a number of police officers who had had prior contact with the appellant and his co-accused identified them in those photographs. This was the evidence upon which the case against the appellant turned. 
     
      
       
      
    6Â Â Â Â  The appellant gave no evidence and called no witnesses. However, he relied upon an electronically recorded interview conducted after his arrest, in which he denied any knowledge of the robbery and asserted that he was not in Sydney at the time. His case was developed though cross-examination of the police officers to whom I have referred, questioning the reliability of their identification of him in the bank security photographs.  
     
      
       
      
    7Â Â Â Â  The officer in charge of the investigation was Senior Constable Lynch. It was his evidence that in the afternoon of 8 December 1997, three days after the robbery, he obtained one of the bank security photographs. He immediately recognised the appellant as one of the men in it. He had spoken to him some months earlier, on 30 April 1997, at Glebe Police Station, although his evidence did not disclose how long he was in his company. He had also seen the appellant earlier on 8 December at the intersection of Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets Sydney, near the Downing Centre court complex. 
     
      
       
      
    8Â Â Â Â  When the appellant was at Glebe Police Station on 30 April, he was also seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch (apparently no relation to Senior Constable Lynch), Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge. Detective Senior Constable Porter said that he saw the appellant during the afternoon and the evening of that day, as did Detective Sergeant Lynch. Senior Constable Shoobridge said that he was in the appellantâ€™s company for several hours. Detective Sergeant Lynch saw him again on three separate occasions during 7 August. He also saw him in the vicinity of the Downing Centre courts on the morning of 8 December. Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge were also at the Downing Centre that day and both saw the appellant inside the court building.  
     
      
       
      
    9Â Â Â Â  On 9 December, again at the Downing Centre, Senior Constable Lynch showed the bank security camera photograph to the other three police officers. Each gave evidence that he immediately recognised one of the men depicted as the appellant. Before the jury there was no evidence about the circumstances in which the appellant came to be at Glebe Police Station on 30 April or was seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch on 7 August. However, there was evidence that on 8 and 9 December he was at the Downing Centre as a defence witness in a trial which was then in progress. 
     
      
       
      
    10Â Â Â Â  By 12 December a number of further bank security photographs had been developed. On that day, Senior Constable Lynch showed all the photographs to Constable Carrick, who was stationed at Redfern. He gave evidence that he recognised the appellant in them. He said that he had seen and spoken to the appellant in the Redfern area a number of times during 1997. He also gave no evidence of the circumstances of those encounters, except to say that on several of those occasions he gave the appellant traffic infringement notices. 
     
      
       
      
    11Â Â Â Â  The other police officers were also shown the other photographs but, of course, the significant evidence was their recognition of the appellant in the single photograph which each of them was shown on 9 December. 
     
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
      
    12Â Â Â Â  The primary ground of appeal was that the evidence of the police officersâ€™ identification of the appellant from the bank security camera photographs should have been excluded. This appeal was heard together with two others, in which it was argued that evidence of this kind is inadmissible for the same reasons as were advanced in the present case. One of those cases was R v Mundarra Smith [1999] NSWCCA 317 and Sheller JA dealt with the argument at paragraphs 12 to 24 of his judgment in that case, rejecting it. I respectfully agree with what his Honour has written and there is no need to repeat it here. 
     
      
       
      
    13Â Â Â Â  As in Smith, it was also argued on the present case that the trial judge ought to have excluded the evidence on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant: s137 Evidence Act 1995. Clearly, there was a danger of prejudice arising from the fact that the identifying witnesses were police officers, although the evidence was led in such a way as to minimise that prejudice as far as it could be. Nevertheless, its probative value was high. In determining to admit the evidence, the learned trial judge performed the balancing exercise required by s137 and I am not persuaded that he fell into error in his approach to the matter. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      
    14Â Â Â Â  There was also a ground of appeal that the juryâ€™s verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. However, this ground was pressed only if the previous ground were successful, in which event there would clearly be insufficient evidence to support the convictions. That being so, this ground also must fail. 
     
      
       
      
    15Â Â Â Â  I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 

THE COURT: 

The  applicants,  Bruno  Grollo  and  Robert  Charles 

Howard, seek leave to appeal from orders of a single Judge of 

the Court.  Each order dism~ssed, on certain undertakings from 

the  respondents,  a  motion  for  an  interlocutory  injunction 

4 

restraining  the  first,  third  and  fourth  respondents  from 

carrying  into  effect, acting  upon  or  otherwise enforcing  or 

seeking  to  enforce  a  decision  or  order  made  by  the  second 

 respondent,^. constituting  the  Magistrates'  Court,  on-  21 

December  1993  for  the  compulsory  fingerprinting  of  each 

applicant.  The second respondent, Ms.  Dessau, is a Magistrate 

for the State of Victoria.  Her order was made on application 

under  s.464M  of  the  Crimes  Act  1958  (Vic)  by  the  first 

respondent, an officer of the Australian Federal Police.  Sub- 

ss. 464M(3),  (4) and (5) provide: 

., 

""(3) The  Court  may  make  an  order  directing  a 
suspect to give his or her fingerprints if 
the suspect - 

(a)  is  in  custody within  the meaning  of 

this Subdivision; or 

(b)  has been charged with an offence; or 

(c)  has  been  summonsed  to  answer  to  a 

charge - 

and the Court is satisfied as required by sub- 
section (4) or (5). 

(4)  The  Court  may  make  an  order  under  sub- 

section (3) if satisfied that - 

(a)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  suspect  in  respect 
of  whom  the  order  is  sought  has
--------
the 

committed 
whether 
indictable  or  summary,  for  which  he 
or  she  is  in  custody,  has  been 
charged or has been summonsed; and 

offence, 

(b)  a  fingerprint has  been  found  at  the 
scene of  the offence, on a victlm of 
the  offence or  on  an object used  in 
or  in connection with  the  commission 
of the offence; and 

(c)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  taking  of  the 
suspect's  fingerprints would  tend  to 
confirm  or  disprove  the  involvement 
of  the  suspect  in the  commission  of 
the offence. 

(5)  The  Court  may  make  an  order  under  sub- 

section (3) if satisfled that - 

(a)  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to 
believe  that  the  suspect  in  respect 
of  whom  the  order  is  sought  has 
committed the offence for which he or 
she  is  in  custody,  has  been  charged 
or has been summonsed; and 

(b)  the offence is an indictable offence; 

and 

(c)  there  is  reasonable  doubt  concerning 
the  identity  of  the  suspect  and  the 
taking  of  the  suspect's  fingerprints 
would dispel that doubt."" 

Each applicant has instituted a proceeding in this Court under 

s.39B  of  the  J u d i c i a r v   Act  1903  and  for  review  under  the 

Administrative  Decisions 

( J u d i c i a l   R e v i e w )   A c t   1977  of  the 

decislon of Ms. Bates to apply under s.464M of the C r i m e s   A c t  

1958  (Vic.),  and  the  declsion  of  the  learned  Magistrate  to 

order the compulsory fingerprinting of the applicants.  It was 

accepted on both sides before the learned primary Judge  (Gray 

J.)  that  the  applicant's  claims  in  the  proceeding  raise 

serious  questions  to  be  tried. 

In  the  light  of  that
--------
concession the learned primary Judge said: 

""[Tlhe  difficulty  arises  of  determining  where 
lies the  justice of  the case in relation to  a 
stay,  while  the  applicants  seek  to  vindicate 
the rights which they claim they have. 

. 

of 

the 

On  the  one  hand,  the  refusal  of  a  stay would 
.involve  each 
applicants  being 
fingerprinted, no doubt soon after the existing 
stay  runs  out  which  is,  as  I  understand  it, 
tomorrow  and  any  evidence  obtainable  as  a 
result  of  their  fingerprinting  being  used 
against them in the committal proceeding due to 
commence  on  11th  April  and  afterwards  in  any 
trial that may result. 

On  the  other  hand,  a  stay  altogether  will 
frustrate  the  investigative  process  and  will 
perhaps  delay  or  fragment  the  committal  and 
possibly  delay  any  resulting  trial,  in  the 
event  that  the  applicants  are  unsuccessful  in 
these proceedings."" 

His Honour then expressed the opinion that  ""the balance could 

be struck between those extreme positions"" by exacting certain 

undertakings  from the respondents to destroy the  fingerprints 

obtained  pursuant  to  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order  in  the 

event  that  the  applicants  should  ultimately  succeed  in  the 

proceedings  initiated  in  this  Court.  As  they  emerged  after 

further  discussion,  the  undertakings  which  prefaced  his 

Honour's  order in each application were: 

""A.  Upon  the  First,  Third  and  Fourth 
Respondents  undertaking  to  the  Court  by 
their  Counsel  for  themselves,  their 
servants and agents that in the event that

order of  the Second Respondent made on 21 
December 1993 pursuant  to Section 464M of 
the  Crimes  Act  1958  (""the  Order"")  was 
invalid or should otherwise be  set aside,
--------
and  the  time  for  appeal  from  the 
determination  has  expired,  without  an 
appeal  having been  brought, or the matter 
having being determined by the High Court, 
they will:- 

(a)  within  seven days of  the date of the 
determ~nation or  the  expiration  of

resisting 

in 

In  the  light  of  those  undertakings,  Gray  J.  refused  the 

application for a  stay.  The applicants seek leave to  appeal 

from  that  refusal. 

It  was  accepted  that  the  principles 

governing applications to this Court for leave to appeal from 

an  interlocutory order of  a  single Judge  require  that  leave 

should only be  granted  if  the Full  Court  concludes that  the 

decision at  first instance was  attended with sufficient doubt 

and, if  allowed to stand, would work  a  substantial injustice 

to  the  applicant  for  leave. 

Thus  in  Adam  P.  Brown  Male 

F a s h i o n s   P t v .   L t d .   v.  P h i l i ~  Morris  Inc.  (1981) 148 C.L.R.  170 

at  177  in the  joint  judgment of Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson  and 

Brennan JJ. lt was observed: 

""An interlocutory order for an injunction is a 
matter  of  practice  and  procedure.  See McHarg 
v.  U n i v e r s a l   S t o c k   Exchange  L t d .   [l8951  2  Q B

discharge of that task.  Not only must there be 
error  of  principle,  but  the  decision  appealed 
from must  work  a  substantial  injustice to  one 
of the parties.  The opposing view is that such 
criteria  are  to  be  expressed  disjunctively. 
Cases  can  be  cited  in  support of  both  views:

unnecessary and indeed unwlse to lay down rigid

We 
would  merely  repeat,  with  approval,  the  oft- 
cited  statement of  Sir Frederick  Jordan in  In 
re the Will  of F B  Gilbert  (dec)  (1946) 46  SR 
(NSW) 318, at p.323: 

'. . .  I am of opinlon that, . . . there is a 
material difference between an exercise of 
discretion  on  a  point  of  practice  or 
procedure  and  an  exercise  of  discretion 
which  determines  substantive rights.  In 
the former class of case, if a tight rein 
were  not  kept  upon  interference  wlth  the 
orders  of  Judges  of  first  instance,  the 
result would  be  disastrous  to  the  proper 
administration of  justlce.  The  disposal 
of  cases  could  be  delayed  interminably, 
and  costs  heaped  up  indefinitely,  if  a 
litigant with a  long purse or a  litigious 
disposition  could,  at  will,  in  effect 
transfer  all  exercises  of  discretion  in 
interlocutory applications from a Judge in 
Chambers to a Court of Appeal.'

flowing  from  the  order  appealed  from  will 
generally  be  a  relevant  and  necessqry 
consideration."" 

For the applicants before this Court it was argued that, given 

the acceptance on both sldes that there was a serious question 

to be tried, his Honour erred in not  finding that the balance 

of  convenience  favoured  the  grant  of  an  interlocutory

injunction.  That  error  was  said  to  consist  in  allowing  a 

purely  hypothetical  inconvenience  to  the  prosecution  to 

outweigh  a  positive  and  irreparable  prejudice  to  the 

appllcants if the fingerprints were taken before the committal 

hearing. 

d 

For  present  purposes  the  charges  against  the 

appllcants to be  considered are of  a  conspiracy between them 

and John  Flanagan to effect a purpose that is unlawful under 

a  law  of  the  Commonwealth,  contrary  to  s.86(1) (c) of  the 

Crimes  Act  1914  (Cth), and of a conspiracy between Mr. Grollo 

and  John Flanagan to commit  an offence against a  law of  the 

Commonwealth, contrary to s.86(l)(a)  of that Act.  A committal 

hear~ng in respect  of  those  charges  and  one other  charge  of 

conspiracy is to commence on 11 April  1994.  The case proposed 

to be proved is that Mr. Grollo, being engaged in dispute with 

the Australian  Taxatlon  Office  concerning  alleged  income  tax 

liabilities  of  companies  with  which  he  was  associated,  and 

having  been  made  the  subject  of  an  investigation  by  the 

Australian Federal Police  (""the A.F.P."")  into  allegations  of 

fraud by  him  in connection wlth  those  liabilities, conspired 

with  Messieurs  Flanagan  and  Howard  to  bribe  a  Detective 

Superintendent of the A.F.P.,  Lloyd Farrell, whom Mr. F-lanagan 

knew,  to  furnish  Mr.  Grollo  with  information  about  the 

investigation and about policemen and lawyers acting on behalf 

of  the  A.F.P.  and  the  Commonwealth  Director  of  Public 

Prosecutions, by  use of which  information Mr.  Grollo hoped to 

win success in the disputes which derived from the allegations
--------

of  income  tax  liabilities  and  income  tax  fraud.  Evidence 

will,  it  is  s a ~ d ,  be  led,  from  Mr.  Farrell  and  others, of 

requests  to  Mr.  Farrell  by  Mr.  Flanagan  for  information of 

that  kind,  and  of  offers  and  payments  of  bank  notes 

aggregating  thousands  of  dollars,  by  Mr.  Flanagan  to  Mr. 

Farrell, and  of  the provision  to Mr.  Flanagan by  Mr.  Farrell 

ofdinformation, apparently  of  the  kind  solicited, some  oral 

and  some  in writing.  It  is  to  be  alleged  in evidence  that 

some of the written material was  later seized by police under 

the authority of search warrants in places to which Mr. Grollo 

and Mr. Howard, who was  at relevant times an employee of  one 

of  the  companies  with  which  Mr.  Grollo  was  associated,  had 

access.  The evidence before Gray J. did not suggest that Mr. 

Howard's  fingerprints have been available to the police.  But 

there was evidence that fingerprints of Mr.  Grollo, furnished 

by  him  to  the  Victorian  Police  Force  in  support  of  an 

application by  him  for  a  firearms  licence, was  available to 

the A.F .P., and  that those  fingerprints had  been compared by 

the A.F.P. with fingerprints on documents seized under warrant 

and with  fingerprints on the bank  notes alleged to have been 
handed by  Mr.  Flanagan to Mr. Farrell.  . 
appeared  with  Mr.  J.  Beach  for  Mr.  Grollo,  supported  by  a 

Merkel Q.C.,  who 

number  of  submissions  his  contention  that  Mr.  Grollo  would 

suffer  irreparable prejudice  if  the order  for  fingerprinting 

were  not  stayed  and  were  later  set  aside.  One  subrniss~on 

postulated  that  evidence  might  be  given  on  the  committal 

hearlng  that  a  comparison  of  Mr.  Grollo's  fingerprints, 

obtained  under  the  Magistrates'  Court's 

order,  and
--------
10. 

fingerprints on one or more of the bank notes alleged to have 

been  passed  by  Mr.  Flanagan  to  Mr.  Farrell  showed  that  Mr. 

Grollo had handled one or more such notes.  In that event, it 

was submitted, the publication of a report of evidence of the 

result  of  that  comparison  in  the  committal  hearing  by 

newspaper. or  broadcasting,  to  persons  who  would  later  be 

members  of  the  jury  at  Mr.  Grollo's  trial,  would  gravely 

prejudice  his  right  to  a  fair  trial  if,  after  that 

publication, the Magistrates' Court's  order were set aside and 

the evidence were not admitted at the trial.  It was  further 

submitted  that  that  consideration  should  weigh  heavily  in 

favour of  staying the  order.  There  is, we  think,  force  in 

those  submissions.  But  the  question  arises  as  to  whether 

those, or any  similar, submissions were  advanced  before  Gray 

J. 

Shortly after the hearing of the motions for stay of 

the  orders  had  commenced  on  27  January  1994 before  Gray  J. 

Mr.  Weinberg  Q.C.,  who  appeared  with  Miss  Carlin  for  the 

respondents  other  than  Ms.  Dessau,  sought  to  tender  an 

affidavit  sworn by  Peter Barrington Kidd  on that  day.  From 

the  affidavit  and  exhibits  thereto  it  appeared  that  Mr. 

Grollo's  fingerprints  which  had  been  furnished  to  the 

Victorian  Police  in  support  of  his  firearms  licence 

application  had  been  compared  with  fingerprints  on  certain 

documents  (including  the  bank  notes  to  which  we  have 

referred).  On some of the documents Mr. Grollo's  fingerprints 

appeared, according to the exhibits, but not on any bank note.
--------
11. 

It further appeared that it was intended to tender evidence at 

the  committal  hearing  of  the  presence  of  Mr.  Grollo's 

fingerprints on the documents, as circumstances  incriminatory 

of him  in respect of the informations laid against him.  They 

included  documents  alleged  to  have  been  furnished  by  Mr. 

Farrell  to  Mr.  Flanagan as  contain~ng information  useful  to 

Mr .d.  Grollo.  Mr.  Merkel  requested  that  his  Honour  hear  in 

camera  the  respondents'  application  that  the  affidavit  be 

received  in  evidence  on  the  hearing  of  the  motion. 

The 

following dialogue then occurred: 

""MR  MERKEL: 
It  relates  to  certain 
material,  your  Honour,  that  is  sought  to  be 
relled upon in the committal. 

Yes. 

HIS  HONOUR:

In  which  case  it  will  be 

MR  MERKEL:  No, but  it may  not be  admissible, 
and  it may  not be able to be  relied upon  and, 
in  effect,  your  Honour,  we  are  anxious  that 
there  by  no  publicity  concerning  the  matter 
pending a court properly considering whether it 
is  able  to  be  received.  The  application  we 
will  be  making,  your  Honour,  is  that  your 
Honour  should  not  receive  or  allow  this 
material to be relied upon and in any event if 
it is, your Honour, that it ought to be subject 
to  a  direction  if your Honour does  receive  it 
that  the  contents  not  be  disclosed, and  I  am 
constrained in making  that  application.  I do 
not  think  my  learned  friend  objects  to  the 
course  we  are  asking,  your  Honour,  it  is  in 
fact what happened in the Magistrates' Court.: 

A little later there was further dialogue: 

""MR MERKEL:  Your Honour, I think that where a

MR  MERKEL:  And  that  could  be  prejudicial  to

I  should  say,  your

they are to have regard only to what they hear 
in  the  court  room  and  not  to  have  regard  to 
anything that they might or might not have read

so, I think that the community generally has a 
healthy  distrust of  the  accuracy of  the media 
these days."" 

After  Gray  J.  had  read  the  affidavit  and  exhibits 

Mr.  Merkel  sought an order, pursuant  to  s.50  of  the  Federal
--------
13. 

Court of Australia Act  1976, that publication of the evidence 

contained  in  those  documents  be  forbidden,  on  the  ground 

afforded  by  the section that such an order was  ""necessary in 

order to prevent prejudice to the administration of  justice"". 

His Honour said to Mr.  Merkel  :  ""Your only suggestion can be 

that  somehow or  other publicity  of  this  might  prejudice  the 

trkal"".  Mr. Merkel agreed. 

When invlted by his Honour to state the relevance of 

the  affidavit  and  exhibits  to  the  application for  a  stay of 

the Magistratesr Court's  order Mr.  Weinberg polnted  out  that 

evidence  would  be  led  at  the  committal  hearing  that  Mr. 

Grollo's  fingerprints  were  on  certain  documents  (being 

evidence  derived  from  the  fingerprints  furnished  voluntarily 

on the application for a firearms licence), and submitted that 

in those circumstances media publicity about further evidence, 

based upon a clearer set of fingerprints obtained in pursuance 

of the order, would not significantly enhance any prejudice in 

the  minds  of  potential  jurors.  Mr.  Weinberg  did,  however, 

explain  to  his  Honour  that  if  the  clearer  fingerprints 

expected to be obtained under the order enabled the conclusion 

to  be  drawn  that  Mr.  Grollo's  fingerprints  were  on  a  bank 

note,  evidence  of  that  conclusion  would  afford  .""highly 

incriminating"" evidence.  As  Mr.  Weinberg put  it to Gray J., 

""it is  as  though one  had  a  gun which  has  been  used  for the 

commission  of  a  murder  and  a  fingerprint has  been  found  on 

it.""  Thus was his Honour's  attention drawn to a consideration 

which  some  might  think  important  by  counsel  of  great
--------
experience in criminal law. 

14. 

Mr.  Merkel  not  pressing  the  application under  s.50 

of  the  Federal  Court  of Australia  Act  1976, Gray  J.  invited 

counsel  to  put  their  submissions  for  and  against  a  stay 

without  finally ruling on the admissibility of  the affidavit, 

buB.on the footing that it would be admitted.  Mr. Merkel made 

no  reference, in his oral submissions, nor is there reference 

in  written  submissions  which  he  placed  before  Gray  J.  in 

support of  a stay, to the harmful effect on potential  jurors 

of  publication  of  evldence  derived  from  use  of  fingerprints 

obtained  under  the  Magistrates'  Court's  order. 

During 

subm~ssions which  he  advanced  in  reply  to  Mr.  Weinberg's 

submissions Mr.  Merkel  said  :  ""So we would  say, your Honour, 

that my learned frlend [Mr. Weinberg] waved before your Honour 

an  array  of  possibilities.  He  introduced  and  then  removed 

publicity, which was not part of our submission, your Honour"". 

We consider that Gray J. would  have understood those words as 

an abandonment of reliance on publication to potential jurors 

of evidence, given at the committal hearing, derived from use 

of  fingerprints obtained under the Magistrates' Court's  order, 

as  a  consideration  in  favour  of  making  the  stay  order  for 

which Mr. Grollo was applying.  Having regard to all that had 

been s a ~ d  during the hearing before those words were spoken by 

Mr.  Merkel,  we  do  not  consider  that  counsel  for  Mr.  Grollo 

should be permitted to place reliance on that consideration in 

support of the application for leave to appeal from the order 

Gray J. made, elther as showing error on his Honour's  part or
--------
as  showing  the  order  hls  Honour  made  to  be  productive  of 

substantial injustice to Mr. Grollo. 

15. 

Other  aspects  of  prejudice  to  Mr.  Grollo  which 

refusal of a stay of the Magistrates' Court's  order will cause 

-  and other aspects of substantial injustice to Mr.  Grollo if 

leave to appeal against the order of Gray J. be refused -  were 

summarised  in  written  submissions  to  this  court  on  Mr. 

Grollo's  behalf, thus: 

""10.  Substantial injustice has  been  caused  to 
the Applicant by reason of the stay being 
refused.  His  Honour  failed  to  give any 
welght to the following considerations:- 

10.1  The denial of the stay would  carry 
the  Order  into  effect,  thereby

10.5  The  refusal  of  the  stay  will

the 
Applicant's  rlghts  in  relation  to 
his  committal  proceeding  including 
the right:-

(i) 

to  not  be  committed  on  the 
basis  of  evidence  which  is 
not  able  to  be  uded  on  his 
trial; 

proceeding 

(ii)  to  give  evidence  in  the 
committal 
in 
relation  to  evidence  which 
may properly be used against 
him  rather  than  evidence 
which is not able to be used- 
on his trial; 

(ili)  to determlne whether to give 
evidence  at  the  committal 
proceeding  on  the  basis  of 
evidence  able to be  used  on 
his trlal ; 

(lv)  to  be  discharged  upon  the 
close  of  the  prosecution 
case  and/or  the  Applicant's 
case if the evidence able to 
be  used  at  trial  does  not 
warrant his committal; 

(v) 

to  be  committed  for  trial 
only  upon  evidence  able  to 
be used at his trial."" 

Each of  those considerations was  relevant to  the exercise of 

his  Honour's  dlscretlon.  The weight  to be  accorded  them was 

for his Honour to determlne.  That he did not expressly refer 

to them does not in my opinion show that he failed to glve any 

weight to them.  They are obvious upon a consideration of the 

circumstances  disclosed  to  Gray  J. 

And  his  Honour  was 

speaking ex tempore in resolution of what had been represented 

to be  an urgent application heard  in vacation.  In my opinlon
--------
17. 

Gray J. would not have been  in error if  he had  thought those 

considerations to be  of  relatively slight weight, as a matter 

of  reality,  in  the  circumstances  disclosed  by  the  evidence 

before him. 

.Two  considerations  of  greater  weight,  in  our 

ophion,  are  the  risk  of  prejudicing  the  minds  of  persons 

ultimately  becoming  jurors  at  Mr.  Grollo's  trial  by 

publication  of  evidence  subsequently held  to be  inadmissible 

at  that  trial,  and  the  risk  that  evidence  based  on  a 

comparison  of  fingerprints  obtained  under  the  Magistrates' 

Court's  order  with  fingerprints  on  the  documents  might  be 

admitted  in  evidence  at  the  trlal  notwithstanding  a  curial 

decision that  the  order was  invalld  or  should be  set  aside. 

As to the former risk, we have concluded that reliance was not 

placed upon it before Gray J.  Further, opinions -  they can be 

nothing  more  than that  -  as  to  the  degree  of  that  risk may 

vary  between  judges.  The  transcript  of  the  hearing  before 

Gray  J.  suggests  that  his  Honour  did  not  rate  the  risk  as 

grave.  We must not treat a difference between our perception 

of  the  degree  of  risk  and 

his  Honour's  perception  as 

establishing error of law on his part.  As to the latter risk, 

the  undertakings  required  by  Gray  J.  have  annihilated  it. 

Evaluation of  the degree of  rlsk that the evidence, although 

unlawfully  obtained, might  be  admitted  at trial is not easy. 

It may be considered very unlikely that the evidence would be 

admitted  in those circumstances.  On  the other  hand,  if  the 

evidence were  admitted, the  object  sought  to  be  achieved  by

the  applicant  in  this  proceeding  would  ultimately  be  wholly 

frustrated.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant was
tried by a judge and jury on a charge of second degree murder.Â  In his charge
to the jury, the trial judge described three possible grounds upon which the
appellant could be found guilty.Â  First, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty of aiding and abetting an intentional killing
by the combined operation of ss.Â 21(1)Â  and 212Â (a) of the Criminal
CodeÂ .Â  Secondly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found
guilty as a party to a murder by the combined operation of ss.Â 21(2)Â  and
213Â (a) of the Criminal CodeÂ .Â  Thirdly, the jury was instructed
that the appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined
operation of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c) of the Criminal CodeÂ .Â  The
trial judge clearly stated that the appellant could be found guilty of murder
whether or not he knew or ought to have known that the victim's death would
result in the circumstances.Â  The charge was given before the Supreme Court's
decisions in R. v. Vaillancourt, R. v. Martineau, and R. v.
Logan, and was appropriate at the time.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The jury found the
appellant guilty on the charge of second degree murder and this verdict was
upheld on appeal.Â  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge's
instructions to the jury were inconsistent with R. v. Vaillancourt since
they allowed the appellant to be convicted on the combined application of
ss.Â 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c) as a party to murder even if he did not have objective
foresight of the death of the victim.Â  The majority of the Court of Appeal,
however, invoked the curative provisions of s.Â 686(1)(b)(iii)
(formerly 613(1)(b)(iii)) of the Criminal CodeÂ  in order to uphold
the appellant's conviction.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant
appealed as of right on the question whether his conviction was properly
sustained through the application of s.Â 686(1)(b)(iii) and with
leave at large.Â  The appellant submitted that s.Â 213Â (c) was
inconsistent, both alone and in combination with s. 21(2)Â  of the Criminal
CodeÂ , with ss.Â 7Â  andÂ 11Â (d) of the CharterÂ .Â  He also
submitted that this restriction could not be justified under s.Â 1Â  of the CharterÂ .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Held:Â  The appeal should be allowed.Â 
Section 213Â (c) of the Criminal CodeÂ  contravenes ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d)
of the CharterÂ  and is not justified under s. 1Â .Â  Section 21(2)Â 
contravenes ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d) of the CharterÂ  with respect to
offences for which subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement in so
far as it permits a party to be convicted on the basis that he or she ""ought
to have known"" that the commission of the offence would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose.Â  This restriction of ss. 7Â  and
11Â (d) is not justified under s. 1Â .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In R. v.
Martineau, it was necessary for the Court to determine the minimum degree
of mens rea required by the CharterÂ  for the offence of murder in
order to assess the constitutional validity of s.Â 213Â (a) of the Criminal
CodeÂ .Â  The determination of this minimum degree of mens rea was
therefore the live issue before this Court.Â  Consequently, the finding in Martineau
that proof of subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a
conviction for murder and that s. 213Â (a) of the Criminal CodeÂ 
violated the CharterÂ  since it did not embrace this requirement was the ratio
decidendi and not obiter dictum.Â  Similarly, since the principles of
fundamental justice constitutionally require proof of subjective foresight of
death in order to sustain a conviction of a principal for murder, that same
degree of mens rea is constitutionally required to sustain the
conviction of a party to the offence of murder:Â  R. v. Logan.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 213Â (c)
of the Criminal CodeÂ , as worded, violates ss.Â 7Â  and 11Â (d) of
the CharterÂ  and is, therefore, of no force or effect.Â  An accused may be
convicted of murder under s.Â 213Â (c) without proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that he had subjective foresight of the death of his victim.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant's
conviction should not be sustained through the application of s.Â 686(1)Â (b)(iii)
of the Criminal CodeÂ .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal
involves a constitutional challenge, under ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ , to s. 213(c) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 230Â (c)).Â  The appellant challenges the
constitutional validity of s. 213(c) both alone and in combination with
s. 21(2)Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant was
tried by a judge and jury on a charge of second degree murder.Â  In his charge
to the jury, the trial judge described three possible grounds upon which the
appellant could be found guilty.Â  First, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty of aiding and abetting an intentional killing
by the combined operation of ss. 21(1)Â  and 212Â (a) (now 229(a)) of
the Criminal CodeÂ . Secondly, the jury was instructed that the
appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined
operation of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (a) (now 230(a)) of the
Criminal CodeÂ ).Â 
Thirdly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found guilty as a
party to a murder by the combined operation of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c) of
the Criminal CodeÂ .Â  The trial judge clearly stated that the
appellant could be found guilty of murder whether or not he knew or ought to
have known that the victim's death would result in the circumstances.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The jury found the
appellant guilty on the charge of second degree murder.Â  This verdict was
upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal: (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 45, 31 O.A.C.
21.Â  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the appellant could be convicted on the combined
application of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c).Â  The trial judge informed the jury
that, by the operation of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c), the appellant could be
convicted as a party to murder even if he did not have objective foresight
of the death of the victim.Â  The Court of Appeal found, therefore, that the
instructions were not consistent with the judgment of this Court in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.Â  (It should be noted that the Court of
Appeal's judgment in this case was rendered prior to the judgment of this Court
in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.)Â  The majority of the Court of
Appeal, however, invoked the curative provisions of s. 686(1)Â (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46Â  (formerly s. 613(1)Â (b)(iii)),
in order to uphold the appellant's conviction.Â  In dissenting reasons, Cory
J.A. (as he then was) disagreed with the majority on this point.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant now
appeals to this Court as of right on the question whether his conviction was
properly sustained through the application of s. 686(1)Â (b)(iii) and with
leave at large.Â  He requests a new trial on the grounds that the trial judge
erred in instructing the jury that the combined application of ss. 21(2)Â  and
213Â (a) or ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c) could provide the bases for a
conviction for second degree murder.Â  He argues that a conviction for murder
will not lie in the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused
had subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim.Â  An accused, in his
opinion, may only be convicted of murder if the trier of fact is satisfied that
the accused intended to cause the death of an individual or knew that the death
of that individual would be the likely result of his conduct.Â  Similarly, he
submits that an accused may only be convicted as a party to murder upon proof that
he or she had subjective foresight of the death of the victim. The appellant
also submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in applying the
curative provisions of s. 686(1)Â (b)(iii) in this case. 

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The appellant
relies on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, supra.Â  Martineau
involved a challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 213Â (a) of the
Criminal CodeÂ .Â  A
majority of the Court (Dickson C.J., Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory
JJ.) held that s. 7Â  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ  requires proof that an accused had
subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim before a conviction for
murder can be sustained. Under s. 213(a), however, an accused could be
convicted of murder whether or not he intended to kill his victim or knew that
death was a likely result of his conduct.Â  The provision thus violated ss. 7Â 
and 11Â (d) of the CharterÂ  and was declared to be of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)Â  of
the Constitution Act, 1982Â .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The respondent
argued before this Court that the finding of the majority in
Martineau that
subjective foreseeability of death is the minimum constitutional mens rea
requirement for murder is obiter dictum.Â  The respondent emphasized that, under s. 213(a)
of the Code, an accused could be convicted of murder in the absence of proof that
he had objective foresight of the death of his victim.Â  Section 213(a),
therefore, could have been found to violate ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d) of the
CharterÂ  on the basis
that the provision did not require objective foresight of death as an essential
element of the offence.Â  In this light, our findings regarding subjective
foresight of death were arguably unnecessary to the resolution of the case.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In my opinion, a
correct reading of Martineau does not support the respondent's submission.Â  In Martineau, as
I noted above, this Court was asked to pronounce on the constitutional validity
of s. 213Â (a) of the Criminal CodeÂ .Â  To answer this question, it
was necessary to determine the minimum degree of mens rea required by
the CharterÂ  for the offence of murder.Â  The determination of this
minimum constitutional mens rea requirement was therefore the live issue
before this Court. Consequently, our finding in Martineau, that proof of
subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a conviction for
murder and that s. 213Â (a) of the Criminal CodeÂ  violated the CharterÂ 
since it did not embrace this requirement, was not obiter dictum.Â  This
finding was the ratio decidendi of the decision.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Similarly, it was
held by this Court in R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731, that when the
principles of fundamental justice constitutionally require, under s. 7Â  of the CharterÂ ,
that there be a minimum degree of mens rea for conviction of a
particular offence to be sustained, the same minimum degree of mens rea
is constitutionally required for an accused to be convicted under s. 21(2)Â  as a
party to that offence.Â  Since the principles of fundamental justice
constitutionally require proof of subjective foresight of death in order to
sustain a conviction of a principal for murder, that same degree of mens rea
is constitutionally required to sustain the conviction of a party to the
offence of murder.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  An accused may be
convicted of murder under s. 213(c) without proof beyond a reasonable
doubt that he had subjective foresight of the death of his victim.Â 
Accordingly, s. 213(c), as worded, infringes the rights guaranteed by
ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d) of the CharterÂ .Â  The provision cannot be saved by
s. 1Â  of the CharterÂ :Â  see Martineau, supra, at p. 647, and
Logan, supra, at pp. 745-47.Â  Section 213Â (c) is therefore
of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)Â  of the Constitution Act, 1982Â .Â 
The trial judge's charge to the jury was incorrect in law since the jury was
instructed that the appellant could be convicted as a party to murder, on the
combined application of ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (a) or ss. 21(2)Â  and 213Â (c),
in the absence of proof that the appellant had subjective foresight of the
death of the victim.Â  I note, however, that his charge to the jury was entirely
appropriate at the time since it was rendered prior to the decisions of this
Court in Vaillancourt, Martineau and Logan, supra.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I agree with the
dissenting reasons of Cory J.A. in the Court of Appeal that the appellant's
conviction should not be sustained through the application of s. 686(1)Â (b)(iii)
of the Criminal CodeÂ .

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Consequently, I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial.Â  I would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

Â 

1.Does
s. 213(c) of the Criminal CodeÂ  [now s. 230Â (c)] contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7Â  and/or 11(d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ ?

Â 

Yes.

Â 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 213Â (c) of the
Criminal CodeÂ  [now s.
230Â (c)] justified under s. 1Â  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ , and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982Â ?

Â 

No.

Â 

3.Does
s. 21(2) of the Criminal CodeÂ  contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
ss. 7Â  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
FreedomsÂ ?

Â 

Yes,
s. 21(2) of the Criminal CodeÂ  contravenes the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by ss. 7Â  and 11Â (d) of the CharterÂ  with respect to
offences for which subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement in so
far as it permits a party to be convicted on the basis that he or she
""ought to have known"" that the commission of the offence would be a
probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.

Â 

4.If
the answer to question 3 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)Â  of the
Criminal CodeÂ 
justified under s. 1Â  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ , and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982Â ?

Â 

No.

Â

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal lawâ€”Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canadaâ€”Conspiracy to traffic in drugsâ€”Sentence of 12 yearsâ€”New Criminal Code
coming into force during period of offenceâ€”Leave to appeal from sentence
soughtâ€”Whether jurisdiction to entertain appealâ€”Criminal Code,

[Page 61]

1953-54(Can.), c. 51, ss. 408(1)(d), 597(1)(b)â€”Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, ss. 573, 1023â€”The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
259, s. 41.

The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in drugs
and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the
new Criminal Code, which came into force during the period of time
within which the offence was committed. His appeal against the conviction was
dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave to appeal to this Court from that
judgment was refused. His subsequent appeal against the sentence was also
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and from that judgment he applied to this
Court for leave to appeal against the sentence on the question of law as to
whether s. 408(1)(d) was applicable, since, if it was not, the maximum
sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in the former Code, as found
in s. 573, was 7 years. The Crown submitted that this Court was without
jurisdiction to grant leave. The appellant alleged an alteration of the prior
state of the law.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): This Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission
of an indictable offence.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The
question whether this Court had any jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal
has always been negatively answered prior to the coming into force of the new
Code. Goldhamer v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290 and Parthenais v. The
King (1945) (unreported). An intent of Parliament to depart from this state
of the law could not be found either under the provisions of the new Code or
under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

As to the new Code. It is clear that no change has been made
as to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in
indictable offences. The distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure and lead to two distinct judgments. As to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the true meaning of the expression
""whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" in s. 597(1)(b)
must be ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an
appeal to the Court of Appeal. On these provisions, the ""conviction""
which the latter Court may affirm is a conviction within the narrow meaning of Goldhamer
v. The King. ""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in s.
597(1)(b), is the judgment against which an appeal is given under
s. 597(1); and, as nowhere but in the opening words of the section is an appeal
given, that judgment must be a judgment capable of coming within the language
of the opening words. Although the words ""in affirmance of the
conviction"", which were in s. 1024 of the former Code, do not appear in s.
597(1), they are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. No significance
could be attached to the fact that s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large
while under s. 597 the appeal is restricted to pure questions of law. Because
it may be said in certain cases that an applicant comes within the description
of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words of s. 597,
it does not follow that his application does so or in other words, that the
right given is a right to appeal against a conviction in the wider sense.

[Page 62]

As to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The
inconsistencies flowing from the interpretations put by the appellant on s. 41,
clearly indicate that it was never intended by Parliament that the right of
appeal given under this section would extend to indictable offences, as
distinguished from non indictable offences. This is supported by the fact that,
under the Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences
are dealt with in the appellate provisions related to appeal to this Court
under the Code. It is further supported by the clear contradiction which would
exist between the special appellate provisions under the Code and the general
appellate provisions under s. 41.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The
application falls within the literal meaning of the words in s. 597; and the
terms of ss. 583, 592 and 593 do not appear to require the Court to construe s.
597 in the limited sense contended for by the respondent. The case of Goldhamer
v. The King was distinguishable. One of the primary purposes of Parliament
in enacting s. 597 in its present form would be pro tanto thwarted if it
were held that this Court was without jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of
law as to whether a sentence imposed was or was not authorized by statute. No
sufficient reason has been advanced for interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a
jurisdiction which appears to be conferred by the words of that section
construed in their ordinary and literal meaning.

Another line of reasoning leads to the same conclusion.
Reading s. 597 of the Code and s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act together
and as explanatory of each other, as should be done since they are in pari
materia, the word ""conviction"" in both sections should be read
""with a signification including the sentence"", giving thereby effect
to the apparent intention of Parliament that the jurisdiction of this Court in
criminal matters should be strictly limited to points of law and yet wide
enough to assure uniformity in the interpretation of the criminal law
throughout the country.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a sentence. Application refused,
Cartwright J. dissenting.

M. Robb, Q.C., for the appellant.

J. D. Hilton, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:â€”This
is a motion for leave to appeal to this Court against a sentence, imposed by
the trial judge and subsequently confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, on a conviction for an indictable offence.

Goldhar was indicted for having, in the city of Toronto and
elsewhere in the province of Ontario, between the 15th of March and the 6th of
August, 1955, conspired with

[Page 63]

others to commit the indictable offence of having in their
possession a drug for the purposes of trafficking. On this charge, he was found
guilty by a jury, on the 4th of May, 1956, and thereupon sentenced to twelve
years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, 2-3 Elizabeth II, hereafter referred to as the new Code.

During the period of time, within which the offence charged
was committed, i.e. on the first day of April 1955, the new Code came into
force; and this fact gives rise to the question of law on which leave to appeal
is now sought. As formulated, on behalf of the applicant, the question is
whether s. 408(1)(d) of the new Code is applicable to the
conspiracy committed, since, if it is not, the maximum sentence for a
conspiracy not specifically named in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c.
36, is found under s. 573 of the said Statute, namely seven (7) years.

The point of law raised is undoubtedly one of substance and
may possibly, depending particularly of the evidence in the record, affect the
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal, if leave is granted. However, the
primary and major question to be considered and determined is whether this
Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed
for the commission of an indictable offence.

That such a question has always been negatively answered,
prior to the coming into force of the new Code, is not open to question.

In Goldhamer v. His Majesty the King1, the appellant, having
been found guilty of a criminal offence, was sentenced to pay a fine of four
hundred dollars or to be imprisoned during three months in default of payment.
After the fine had been paid, the Attorney-General appealed against the
sentence, under s. 1013 Cr. C; and by a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal,
in addition to the fine, condemned the appellant to be imprisoned for a period
of six months. On a further appeal to this Court, it was decided that there was
no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal in the
matter of

[Page 64]

sentence, the right of appeal being restricted to an appeal
against the affirmance of a conviction. At the time of the decision of this
Court, the relevant part of s. 1024, under which the appeal purported to be
based, read as follows:

1024.â€”Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of
Appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in
writing has been served on the Attorney-General within fifteen days after such
affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of
Canada or a judge thereof.

It is pointed out, in the reasons for judgment of this
Court, that the word ""conviction"" in s. 1024 cannot perhaps be said
to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, but can be capable of
being employed with the signification including the sentence. The majority,
however, felt compelled to ascribe to the word the less technical sense which
excludes the sentence as distinguished from the conviction. The sole reason for
this interpretation and the decision consequential thereto is exclusively
founded on the clear distinction made in s. 1013, for the purposes of appeal in
indictable matters, between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal
against a sentence. The appellant in that case did not question the
appropriateness of the measure of the sentence but challenged, as a matter of
law, the right of the provincial Court of Appeal to interfere with a sentence
which had already been satisfied when the appeal to that Court was taken by the
Attorney-General. The nature of the ground, however, is entirely foreign to the
ratio decidendi. It is the right of appeal itself which was found not to
have been given by Parliament, in the matter of sentence.

Some twenty years after this decision, again the question
arose in the case of Parthenais v. The King2. Parthenais had entered an
appeal in this Court against a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal which
had increased the sentence imposed upon him on a plea of guilty to the charge

[Page 65]

of an indictable offence. At that time, the matter was
governed by what was then s. 1023 Cr. C., the relevant part of which read as
follows:

1023. Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and
thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of
such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal.

The point of law, upon which there was a dissent, was
whether the Attorney-General,â€”who took a more serious view of the facts of the
case than did the Crown prosecutor, in first instance,â€”could appeal to the
Court of Appeal against a sentence imposed upon a plea of guilty which had been
entered by the accused on the condition that the sentence, pre-agreed between
his counsel and counsel for the Crown, would be passed by the trial judge. The
distinction between an appeal against a conviction and an appeal against a
sentence, which had brought about the decision of this Court in Goldhamer,
supra, was still present in the appellate provisions related to appeals to
the provincial Courts. This Court followed the same course and, on the 2nd of
October, 1945, quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal against a sentence.

Such was the state of the law when the new Code was enacted
in 1954. The question is therefore whether an intent of Parliament to make such
a substantial departure from this state of the law, as would represent the
creation of a new right of appeal to this Court, can be found, as is suggested,
either under the relevant provisions of the new Code or under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act. In approaching the question, one must be mindful that a
legislature is not presumed to make any substantial alteration in the law
beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear
implication. This presumption against the implicit alteration of the law is
not, I think, of lesser moment where the new law, under which the alteration is
claimed, is of a nature such as that of the one here considered, to wit, a
revision of a Code.

The new Code. With respect to the appellate provisions
related to appeals to the Court of Appeal in indictable offences, it is clear
that no change has been made, in that,

[Page 66]

the distinction between an appeal against a conviction and
an appeal against a sentence still obtains. Both appeals are still separate
appeals as to substance and procedure, and lead to two distinct judgments. With
respect to the appellate provisions related to appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada, the section of the new Code, relied on by counsel for the applicant as
a basis for his application and under which the alteration of the prior state
of the law is claimed, is s. 597(1)(b), which reads as follows:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

(a)..............................................................................................................................
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦

(b) on any question
of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within
twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such
extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for
special reasons, allow.

The opening words of that section make it equally clear that
the right of appeal to this Court is given to one who is (i) a person who is
convicted of an indictable offence and (ii) whose conviction is affirmed by the
Court of Appeal. The true meaning of the expression, in (ii), ""whose
conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal"" must, of necessity, be
ascertained by reference to the appellate provisions related to an appeal to
the Court of Appeal. And again, on these provisions, the
""conviction"", which the latter Court may affirm, is a conviction
within the narrow meaning ascribed by this Court in Goldhamer, supra. If,
contrary to that decision, the word was here given the wider sense which
includes the sentence, it would follow that one ""whose sentence is affirmed
by the Court of Appeal"" would have a right of appeal to this Court,
while one, whose sentence is not affirmed but increased by the Court of Appeal,
would not.

Adverting now to the provisions of (a) and (b)
of s. 597(1). These provisions are related to the right of appeal given under
the opening words. In (a), they restrict the right of appeal to
questions of law. And, in (b), they condition the exercise of the
right to the obtention of a leave and prescribe the delay within which, after
""the judgment appealed from is pronounced"", such leave must be
granted.

[Page 67]

""The judgment appealed from"", referred to in (b),
is the judgment against which an appeal is given under s. 597(1); and, as
nowhere, but in the opening words thereof, is an appeal given, ""the
judgment appealed from"" must be a judgment capable of coming within the
language of the opening words. On this language and for the reasons just
mentioned, such a judgment can only be a judgment in affirmance of a conviction
and not related to the matter of sentence.

Having considered the following points advanced in support
of the application, I must say, with deference, that I am unable to find that
they are valid.

Reference is made and significance is attached to two points
of difference emerging from a comparison of s. 1024, under which Goldhamer was
decided, with s. 597(1) of the new Code. The first is that the words ""in
affirmance of the conviction"", which were in the former section, do not
appear in the latter. In my view and for the reasons just mentioned, these
words are clearly and necessarily implied in s. 597. The second point is that
s. 1024 provided for an appeal at large while under s. 597, the appeal is
restricted to pure questions of law. The range or nature of the questions
raised in support of an appeal is foreign to the ratio decidendi in Goldhamer.
Furthermore, when the decision in that case was, twenty years later,
followed in Parthenais, the appeal to this Court was then, under the
relevant section, s. 1023, as it is to-day under s. 597(1), restricted to
questions of law.

It is then sought to ascribe to the word
""judgment"" in the phrase ""the judgment appealed from is
pronounced"", the usual meaning given to the word in a law dictionary.
This, I think, one is precluded to do for, in the context of s. 597, and in the
light of the other sections of the Code to which this particular section is
inextricably related, a judgment as to conviction and a judgment as to sentence
are, for the purposes of appeal, two separate judgments, each having a distinct
technical meaning under the Code.

It is also suggested that the applicant having been
convicted of an indictable offence and his conviction having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal,â€”as, in fact, it was finally, prior to the launching of his
appeal to that Court, against the sentence,â€”his application falls within the
literal

[Page 68]

meaning of s. 597(1) (b). While, because of these
circumstances, it may be said that the applicant comes within the
description of a person to whom a right of appeal is given in the opening words
of the section, it does not follow that the application he makes does
so, or that, in other words, the right given to such a person is a right of
appeal against a conviction in the wider sense, as distinguished from a
conviction in the narrow technical sense given in Goldhamer. The premise
upon which this suggestion is predicated has no relevancy to the nature of the
right of appeal which is given under the section. It may also be added that, if
the interpretation contended for were accepted, in the result, Parliament would
have given a right of appeal against sentence to a person coming within the
language of the opening words of the section but would have refused a similar
right to a person who, having appealed to the Court of Appeal only against his
sentence, and not against his conviction, could never possibly come within that
language; for the Court of Appeal cannot affirm an unappealed conviction.

Finally, it is said that in enacting s. 597, in its present
form, one must find an apparent intention of Parliament to ensure uniformity in
the interpretation of criminal law throughout Canada and that such a purpose
would be, pro tanto, thwarted, if we were to hold that we are without
jurisdiction to deal with a pure point of law as to whether a sentence imposed
is or is not authorized by a statute. With respect to sentence, as
distinguished from conviction, I am quite unable, for the reasons above
indicated, to find such an intention of Parliament in s. 597. It also appears
that such an intent is negatived by the other appellate provisions related to
appeals to this Court. Under these appellate provisions, the right of appeal,
given to the Attorney-General, namely in s. 598, does not include the right to
appeal in the matter of sentence. For the implementation of this alleged intent
and purpose of Parliament, it is no less essential that a right, similar to the
one contended for on behalf of the applicant, be given to the Attorney-General;
but it has not been given.

[Page 69]

For these reasons, I am clearly of the view that nowhere in
the relevant provisions of the new Code, did Parliament indicate, either in
express terms or by clear implication, any intent to alter the prior state of
the law, under which there is no appeal to this Court in the matter of
sentence.

Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The relevant
parts of that section read as follows:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

(2) Leave to appeal under this section may be granted during
the period fixed by section 64 or within thirty days thereafter or within such
further extended time as the Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after
the expiry of the said thirty days fix or allow.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section
from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in
respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an
indictable offence.

To support applicant's contention that s. 41 confers
jurisdiction to this Court to entertain appeals in matters of sentence, imposed
in respect of indictable offences, the provisions of subsection (3) are assumed
to be subordinated to those of subsection (1)â€”in that, the latter states the
principle and the former, the exceptionâ€”; and, on that assumption, the
following interpretation is given.

If matters of sentence are held to come within the language
of subsection (3), then, by force of the latter, they are excepted from the
operation of subsection (1); and, for this reason alone, this Court has no
jurisdiction.

If, on the contrary, matters of sentence are held not to
come within the language of subsection (3), then, not being excepted from the
operation of subsection (1), there is jurisdiction in this Court.

In both alternatives, however, this interpretation leads to
inconsistencies.

In the first alternative, while a judgment affirming a
sentence would be excepted from the operation of subsection (1) by force of
subsection (3), there are no words in the latter capable of excepting a
judgment increasing the

[Page 70]

sentence. And, in the result, this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal when the sentence has been increased, but
would be without jurisdiction when it has been affirmed; and this, even if in
either case the question raised in support of the appeal be whether the
sentence is authorized or not by statute.

In the second alternative where, on the interpretation of
subsection (3), this Court would have jurisdiction in the matter of sentence,
the following inconsistencies would ensue. Contrary to what is the situation
with respect to every authorized appeal to this Court in criminal matters, the
appeal against sentence under s. 41 would not be restricted to pure questions
of law but would extend to questions of mixed law and facts and to pure
questions of fact. In addition, the delay within which leave to appeal must be
granted, being determined by subsection (2), would be, in the matter, far in
excess of the delay prescribed for the proper administration of justice in
criminal matters, for the obtention of leave to appeal to this Court against a
conviction or an acquittal.

I cannot think that Parliament ever intended or even
contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of these
interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

This view is supported by the fact that, under the Criminal
Code, the appeals to this Court with respect to indictable offences are,
contrary to what is the case with respect to non indictable offences, dealt
with in the appellate provisions related to appeals to this Court under the
Code.

It is further supported by the clear contradiction which
would exist, on the view that Parliament intended to include indictable
offences in s. 41, between the special appellate provisions under the Code and
the general appellate provisions under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

Parliament is presumed to be consistent with itself and the
language of every Act must be construed as far as possible in accordance with
the terms of every other statute

[Page 71]

which it does not in express terms modify in a way avoiding
contradictions. It has been indicated above that, if s. 597 was interpreted as
giving a right of appeal as to sentences, inconsistencies would result and
that, on the contrary interpretation, there would not be any, the state of the
law remaining what it was prior to the enactment of the new Code. And it has
also been pointed out that inconsistencies would flow from the suggested
interpretation of s. 41. In these views, one cannot find, either under the Code
or under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, the explicit language required
to indicate an intent of Parliament to alter the prior state of the law as to
appeals to this Court in the matter of sentence imposed in respect of
indictable offences.

With great deference, I find it impossible to reconcile the
two Acts by interpreting the word ""conviction"" in both subsections
41(3) and 597(1) (b) as including sentence in indictable offences, for
each one of the subsections cannot be so interpreted without leading to
inconsistencies.

Under the former Code, appeals against sentence have always
been left to the final determination of the provincial Courts and there is
nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, indicating
a change of policy in the matter, with respect to indictable offences.

This Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the present
application which I would dismiss.

This being a matter of jurisdiction, all the Members of the
Court have been consulted and I am requested by the Court to say that all,
excepting our brother Cartwright, are in agreement with these reasons.

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):â€”This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on May 29, 1959,
dismissing the applicant's appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by His
Honour Judge Macdonell on May 4, 1956. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was
brought pursuant to an order of that Court made on April 29, 1959, extending
the time for applying for leave to appeal and granting leave to appeal against
the sentence mentioned.

[Page 72]

On April 27, 1956, the accused was convicted before His
Honour Judge Macdonell at the sittings of the Court of General Sessions of the
Peace for the County of York on the charge that:

Jacob Rosenblat, Jack Goldhar (the applicant), Leonuell
Joseph Craig and Hannelore Rosenblum, at the City of Toronto, in the County of
York, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, between the 15th day of March
and the 6th day of August, in the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together,
the one with the other or others of them and persons unknown, to commit the
indictable offence of having in their possession a drug, to wit,
diacetylmorphine, for the purpose of trafficking, an indictable offence under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary to the Criminal Code.

On May 4, 1956, His Honour Judge Macdonell sentenced the
applicant to twelve years' imprisonment in Kingston Penitentiary.

An appeal against this conviction (but not against the
sentence imposed) was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario3 and was dismissed on February 13,
1957; leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment was refused4 on May 1, 1957.

The sentence of twelve years was imposed pursuant to s.
408(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by 2-3
Elizabeth II, c. 51, which came into force on April 1, 1955, and is referred to
in these reasons as ""the new code"". Section 408 reads in part as
follows:

408(1) Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the
following provisions apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

* * *

(d) every one who conspires with any one to
commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to the same
punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of that offence would,
upon conviction, be liable.

The maximum term of imprisonment for the indictable offence
of having possession of a drug for the purpose of trafficking is fourteen
years, as provided by s. 4(3) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which
section came into force on June 10, 1954.

Under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36,
hereinafter referred to as ""the old code"", the maximum term of
imprisonment which could have been imposed upon the

[Page 73]

applicant for the offence of which he was convicted would
have been seven years, as provided by s. 573 of the old Code which reads as
follows:

573. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

The question of law on which leave to appeal to this Court
is sought is stated in the notice of motion as follows:

Whether Section 408(1)(d) of The Criminal Code
1953-1954, Ch. 51 is applicable to the conspiracy committed, since if it is not
the maximum sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in The Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, Ch. 36, is found under Section 573 of the said Statute,
namely seven (7) years.

On the merits, it is sufficient, for purposes of this
motion, to say that the ground of appeal sought to be raised is, in my opinion,
one of substance and difficulty; its importance is obvious; if the applicant's
contention is upheld he will have been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in
excess of the maximum term permitted by law.

Counsel for the respondent submits that we are without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing an appeal against the sentence passed by the trial Court.

Counsel for the applicant bases his application on s.
597(1)(b) of the new Code which reads:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence
whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada

* * *

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the
judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the
Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

It will be observed that this application falls within the
literal meaning of the words quoted. The applicant is a person who has been
convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and he seeks leave to appeal to this Court on a question of
law. It is important to observe that the present section does not say ""may
appeal against the affirmance of such conviction"" as did its
predecessor. It is contended for the

[Page 74]

respondent, however, that other provisions of the Code, the
history of the legislation and the jurisprudence dealing with it require us to
construe s. 597 as giving a convicted person a conditional right of appeal
against his conviction only and not against ",30/11/1959 0:00,CA Supreme Court

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 10 March 2009 Emma Barrett pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge that on 23 June 2007 she murdered David Harrison. 
     
      
    2 The story leading up to this killing is quite a lengthy one. It started in rural South Australia in about 2004, when the offender first met the deceased, David Harrison. He was working as a supervisor at the Kooyong Dairy, where relatives of the offender were also working. The offender was aged 18 at the time, and already had two young children. 
     
      
    3 The offender and the deceased commenced a relationship, which was interrupted the following year when the offender was abducted by Mr Moslan, the father of her children. He forcibly detained her at gun point, and assaulted her, which in due course led to his being convicted and imprisoned for a number of criminal offences. The deceased in the meantime had moved back to his home in Victoria. His relationship with the offender resumed in 2006 when he returned to South Australia in order to give evidence in Mr Moslanâ€™s trial. 
     
      
    4 Later in 2006 the offender moved to New South Wales where she lived for a time with the deceased at Curlewis, near Gunnedah. It was here that she first met her co-offender, Dean Fordham. Mr Fordham became extremely attached to the offender and her children. Probably for this reason, his relationship with the deceased was always an uneasy one, marked by considerable jealousy on both sides. 
     
      
    5 It was during this time at Curlewis that the offender took a document out of the deceasedâ€™s trouser pocket and showed it to Mr Fordham. She told him that it was the deceasedâ€™s hit list. This document was tendered in evidence on sentence. To any objective observer it is clearly a list of telephone numbers. It included the names and the telephone numbers of the offender and Mr Fordham. This document, and the emotions it engendered in both the offender and Mr Fordham, were central to the events which followed, and I shall be returning to it later. Suffice it to say here that Mr Fordham, an impressionable man of limited education and intelligence, totally accepted that this list was indeed the deceasedâ€™s hit list, and that the deceased was planning to harm him. 
     
      
    6 It is appropriate here to say a little more about the background of the deceased. He was 24 years old when he met his death. Over the years he had undertaken a number of jobs, mainly in a rural setting. He was a licensed firearms holder, as he sometimes had to put down sick animals. The evidence indicated that he had, from time to time, held himself out as a â€œhit manâ€ who did contract jobs. I accept that, if he did say this he was, in effect, big noting himself. There is no acceptable evidence whatsoever, in my view, to support the proposition that he was in fact a contract killer, or a hit man, as the offender said she believed. 
     
      
    7 It is clear that the deceased was extremely fond of the offender, and wanted a full-time relationship with her. This became a source of conflict between them, as she did not want one with him, but she was not prepared to tell him so directly. 
     
      
    8 It is unnecessary for present purposes to chart the movements of the deceased and the offender through the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Suffice it to say that they had something of an on and off relationship during this period, some of which was spent in Victoria and some in New South Wales. 
     
      
    9 In March or April of 2007 the deceased returned to Victoria, after spending some time in New South Wales with the offender. He told his mother that he needed to get a job so that he could support the offender and her two children. 
     
      
    10 In May 2007 the offender and her children, together with the co-offender, Mr Fordham, moved into a house rented by Mr Fordham in Maitland Road, Muswellbrook. In the meantime the deceased remained working in Victoria. In the early stages he told his mother how much he loved the offender and her children, and that he wanted to be able to support them. However, over time his attitude soured, almost certainly because the offender was not responding to his messages. He sent a number of unanswered SMS messages to the offender early in June 2007. These expressed increasing frustration at her failure to respond. Finally, on 12 June, he sent four text messages to the offender in a little over two hours. These assumed considerable significance in the sentencing, and three of them bear repetition here. At 12.10 pm the deceased sent a message saying 
     
      
       
        
        â€œYour just like ya mum a using bitch fuck u I will make sure everyone knows where u are I will make life hell 4 u and ya kids r fuckedâ€ 
        
       
       
      At 12.37 the following message was sent: 
       
       
        
         â€œLike I say u fuck with my heart u get whats coming to uâ€ 
        
       
       
      Finally, at 14.12 the following message was sent: 
       
       
        
        â€œEverythink I done fur u and us kids and u fucked me over u just an unfaithful bitch like ya familyâ€ 
        
       
      
    11 It is apparent in retrospect that it was these messages which ultimately sealed the deceasedâ€™s fate. 
     
      
    12 For some reason the offender did not receive these messages until Monday 18 June. She said that she understood them to be threats to harm herself and her children. I will be saying more about this later. There was then a flurry of telephone calls and SMS messages from her to the deceased in Victoria. That evening the deceased told his mother that he was going to Muswellbrook to help the offender move house. For that purpose he bought a second hand vehicle for $1,200.00. 
     
      
    13 It was at this stage, after receiving the deceasedâ€™s text messages, that the offender decided to kill the deceased. She said in evidence that it was Mr Fordhamâ€™s idea to kill him. However, for reasons I will give later, I do not accept this. I do accept that Mr Fordham became very angry when he saw these messages and that he readily agreed to go along with the offenderâ€™s plan. But it was initially her plan, not his, to invite the deceased to come to Muswellbrook and then to kill him. 
     
      
    14 In preparation for the killing the offender and Mr Fordham went to the central coast where they made a number of purchases. Mr Fordham bought a car for $500.00 which was registered in a fictitious name. The two of them bought a Wiltshire carving knife, which was the murder weapon, garbage bags, bleach and numerous sheets and blankets. The offender wrote a number of notes setting out various methods of committing the murder and disposing of the body. Police were subsequently taken by Mr Fordham to a place where these notes had been buried on his familyâ€™s property, together with clothing and footwear worn by the two of them during the killing. 
     
      
    15 The deceased left his home in Victoria after work on Thursday 21 June, telling his parents that he would be back in time for work the following Monday morning. He arrived at the Maitland Road house in the early hours of Friday 22 June. Rather than knock on the door, he climbed in through a window, which made the co-offender, Mr Fordham, very angry. 
     
      
    16 The initial plan for the killing was that some time during that first day the offender and Mr Fordham would lure the deceased into the garage on the property, where Mr Fordham would come up from behind and cut his throat. That plan failed, as the deceased did not want to go into the garage. The alternative plan was for the offender and the deceased to go out that night, and for Mr Fordham to stab the deceased on their return. This is the plan which was eventually followed. 
     
      
    17 The three of them, the offender, Mr Fordham and the deceased, spent most of that day in the Maitland Road house. A close friend of Mr Fordham had been killed in a car accident the previous day, and he spent much of the day on his own, consuming large quantities of alcohol. That night, well after the offenderâ€™s children had been put to bed, the offender and the deceased went out in his car, in accordance with the previously devised plan. The offender said that they sat in the car and talked. They were away from the home for about two hours. Shortly before their return, at about 2.00 am, while the deceased was out buying some food, the offender telephoned Mr Fordham to tell him that they would be arriving home very shortly. The offender said in evidence that she pleaded with him during this conversation not to proceed with their plan to kill the deceased. For reasons I will discuss later, I do not accept this. 
     
      
    18 When the car arrived back outside the Maitland Road property, Mr Fordham came out of the house carrying a knife concealed up his sleeve. When the deceased got out of the driverâ€™s seat of the car, Mr Fordham stabbed him in the face. The deceased ran around the car towards the offender. He then started to run away towards the end of the street. The offender ordered Mr Fordham to go after him and bring him back. This he did. He caught up with the deceased, not far away, and walked him back to the house. The deceased was then taken to the back of the house and made to sit on a chair immediately outside a shed. It was there that Mr Fordham proceeded to inflict multiple stab wounds upon him. While this was happening the offender was, I accept, inside the house and was unable to see what was happening. In due course Mr Fordham joined her and they smoked some marijuana. Later she went outside and ran back in saying, according to Mr Fordham, â€œHeâ€™s still aliveâ€. According to the offender, she said, â€œHeâ€™s hurtâ€. The precise words matter little. The two of them then ran out to where the deceased was lying and each of them inflicted a further stab wound. The offender said in evidence that she â€œfelt forcedâ€ to do so because of the actions of Mr Fordham. However, I do not accept this. I believe that her action was entirely voluntary. 
     
      
    19 The two of them later put the deceasedâ€™s body into the boot of his car. Mr Fordham drove the deceasedâ€™s car, and the offender followed in the car they had purchased a few days earlier. They went to a remote location outside Greta, where they took the body out of the car and partially buried it. Later, they returned and completed the burial, pouring cement over the body. Later that day, while they were driving through Mayfield, a suburb of Newcastle, the deceasedâ€™s car ran out of petrol. They abandoned it there, breaking a window and removing the sound system in order to make it appear as if it had been stolen. 
     
      
    20 The deceasedâ€™s parents became concerned when he failed to arrive home, as planned, the following Monday, 25 June. On 28 June they reported him missing. On 30 June a police officer telephoned the offender asking about the whereabouts of the deceased. She said that he had left her home in the early hours of Saturday 23 June, saying that he was going to Newcastle. By that time, 30 June, the offender had made a number of concerted attempts to cover her tracks. Between 23 and 27 June she made no less than 28 voice calls and sent 14 SMS messages to the deceasedâ€™s mobile telephone. Moreover, in an undated letter, postmarked 28 June, she wrote to the deceasedâ€™s mother asking her to get the deceased to telephone her, saying that she had been trying to ring him but that he would not respond to her messages. On 2 July, in a telephone conversation with the deceasedâ€™s mother, the offender said, â€œDavid really loved me and I loved David very muchâ€. 
     
      
    21 Late in June the offender and Mr Fordham moved out of the Maitland Road property. The offender and her two children moved into a refuge in Gosford. There the offender befriended a woman whom I shall call LS. On the evening of 16 July 2007 the offender told LS about the killing of the deceased. The next day LS reported the matter to the police. On the same day, 17 July 2007, the police interviewed the offender at Gosford Police Station. Her first reaction, when asked about the killing of the deceased, was, â€œI didnâ€™t do anything, it was Dean. I told him not to do it, and I am not the sort of person who would do something like thatâ€. She proceeded to describe the killing in a manner which placed all responsibility upon Mr Fordham. She said that he, Mr Fordham, was furious because the deceased had put him on his hit list. However, later in the interview she denied that she knew what was meant by a hit list, or that the deceased was capable of harming anyone. She did not call the ambulance or the police, she said, because she was scared of Mr Fordham. She described disposing of the body and returning to the Muswellbrook house where she said Mr Fordham forced her to clean the bloodstains. He, Mr Fordham, then proceeded to dispose of the bag containing the clothing they were wearing during the killing. 
     
      
    22 A further interview took place the next day, 18 July 2007. In this interview the police asked the offender about the account she had given to LS two days earlier, which was significantly more incriminatory than the account she had given to the police. She continued to downplay her role in the killing, saying that it was entirely Mr Fordhamâ€™s fault. She did not want to have anything to do with the killing, she said, but he made her play a role in it. She conceded that she stabbed the deceased once when she believed he was already dead. Later in the interview she said that she had become extremely angry because the deceased had threatened to harm herself and her children and tell the childrenâ€™s father, Mr Moslan, where they were living. 
     
      
    23 After this interview the offender took police to the location near Greta where the deceasedâ€™s body was found. 
     
      
    24 The offender was then charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty, and the trial was due to commence at Newcastle on 9 March 2009. In the meantime, Mr Fordham had pleaded guilty to murder and agreed to give evidence against the offender in her forthcoming trial. After some negotiations between the Crown and the defence, the offender pleaded guilty to murder. This took place in Sydney the day after the trial had been due to commence, namely on 10 March 2009. The offender will obviously get the benefit of this plea in reduction of sentence. It hardly qualifies as an early plea, and must therefore be at the lower end of the range. However, as Mr Ramage QC, who appeared for the offender, pointed out, a lengthy trial involving a large number of witnesses was thereby averted. It was therefore of real utilitarian value. 
     
      
    25 This takes me to a consideration of the objective seriousness of this offence, which is the starting point in assessing the complex series of factors to be taken into account on sentence. I turn first to the aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as they relate to the offence as opposed to the offender. The aggravating features which are not inherent in the offence of murder are, pursuant to s 21A(2)(c), that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon; pursuant to paragraph (2)(e), that the offence was committed in company; and, pursuant to paragraph (2)(n), that it was part of a planned criminal activity. There are no mitigating factors in relation to the offence as opposed to the offender. 
     
      
    26 By far the most significant aggravating factor is the fact that the killing was deliberately and meticulously planned. 
     
      
    27 At this point it is appropriate to go back to the two significant factual matters which were disputed on sentence. These were: first, whether it was the offender or Mr Fordham who first conceived of the killing and directed its planning; and second, whether the offender sought to dissuade Mr Fordham from proceeding with the killing shortly before it was to take place. 
     
      
    28 I have already indicated my finding on the first matter, namely, that it was the offender who conceived the idea of killing the deceased. This is consistent with what she told LS, with the evidence of Mr Fordham and with virtually all the surrounding facts. It was she, not Mr Fordham, who received the so-called threats in the deceasedâ€™s SMS messages. It was she, not Mr Fordham, who wrote the various notes setting out the methods of executing the killing and disposing of the body afterwards. Mr Fordham, as I have said, is a person of very limited education and intelligence and I have no doubt that he was a follower rather than an initiator in this plan; a willing follower no doubt, but a follower nonetheless. 
     
      
    29 I also do not accept that the offender had a last minute change of heart and tried to persuade Mr Fordham to desist from the planned enterprise. Again, this was never mentioned to LS and is inconsistent with other evidence in the case. The telephone call from the offender to Mr Fordham shortly before returning home in the early hours of 23 June lasted only 21 seconds. Had she been genuinely trying to persuade him to desist from their planned venture, one would expect it to have been a longer call. Moreover, the offender admitted that, after the deceased had started to run away down the road, she urged Mr Fordham to go after him and bring him back. In her evidence she sought to give explanations for this which were both inconsistent and unconvincing. Indeed, there were many unsatisfactory aspects of her evidence. It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail them here, but there were numerous inconsistencies, on matters of substance, between the various versions that she gave to LS, to the police and to the court. There were also some matters on which her evidence was inherently implausible. 
     
      
    30 The killing was a particularly brutal one, involving no less than 35 stab wounds. Certainly the offender physically inflicted only one of these and was not present when most of the others were inflicted. Nevertheless, it was she who conceived the killing and planned its execution. It was she who did a great deal afterwards to dispose of any signs of the killing, and to deflect suspicion away from herself, particularly through making the various communications to the deceasedâ€™s mobile phone and to his mother. 
     
      
    31 What, then, motivated this bizarre series of events? To any objective observer the document which the offender described as the deceasedâ€™s hit list was clearly a list of telephone numbers. Certainly there were some veiled threats in the SMS messages sent by the deceased. The statement â€œI will make sure everyone knows where you areâ€ was particularly disturbing for the offender, as Mr Moslan was due out of gaol at about that time and she was very concerned that he should not be able to locate her and the children. Nevertheless, on any objective basis, it was a totally disproportionate response to these veiled threats, for the author to be lured to Muswellbrook and brutally murdered. 
     
      
    32 The answer, in my opinion, must lie in the offenderâ€™s massive ingestion of drugs, particularly marijuana, as part of the substance abuse disorder suffered by the offender. I shall be talking about her background shortly. It is, on any view, an extremely sad one. For quite some time before the killing of the deceased she had been smoking between 20 and 30 cones of cannabis each day. As Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, commented, this had a significant and deleterious impact upon her judgment. Mr Watson-Munro noted that she had suffered a significant substance abuse disorder dating back to her early teenage years. He considered that the offenderâ€™s drug intake had aggravated her underlying symptoms, which included symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. 
     
      
    33 It is well established that drug addiction is not in itself a mitigating factor in sentencing for serious offences. The court cannot be seen as in effect condoning drug use by imposing lesser penalties for drug-related crimes. Those who choose to embark on drugs in the first place, and then maintain their addiction, must, the authorities say, accept the consequences. On the other hand, it has also been said that where the original addiction is not a willed act, that might be taken into account in mitigation. 
     
      
    34 The present case is, on any way of looking at it, a most unusual one. The large amounts of marijuana taken by the offender had so distorted and affected her judgment that she actually believed that the deceased posed some sort of a threat to herself and her children. This belief had no factual foundation, and was essentially the product of the offenderâ€™s defective judgment, which was in turn caused by her drug abuse. 
     
      
    35 In this most unusual situation I propose to treat the offenderâ€™s misguided belief that the deceased posed some sort of threat to herself and her children as a mitigating factor in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence. Given the overall circumstances, it cannot be taken as a major mitigating factor, but it is not an insignificant one. 
     
      
    36 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this offence is â€œwell aboveâ€ the mid-range of seriousness for the crime of murder. Were it not for the offenderâ€™s belief that the deceased posed a threat to her and her children, a belief which was fuelled by her drug intake, I would have agreed with that assessment. Even with that mitigating factor, when one takes into account the degree of planning and the brutality of the killing (even though she was not physically present through much of it), I would still place this offence above the mid-range of objective seriousness, although not significantly so. 
     
      
    37 I turn now to discuss the offenderâ€™s personal background. She was born on 18 September 1986 and was only 20 years old at the time of this offence. She is now 22. She was born in Adelaide. Before she was born her parents separated and her mother commenced a relationship with another man. Until she was eight years old she believed that this manr was her real father. He used to assault her both physically and sexually and there was a great deal of violence in the home. At the age of 13 she discovered her real father. She went to live with him, but his partner was a woman much younger than him and only a few years older than the offender. The domestic relationships were difficult and, at about the age of 15, she left and went onto the streets where she effectively worked as a prostitute. It was there that she met the father of her children, Mr Moslan, with whom she maintained a relationship, albeit a difficult and not a constant one, for nearly two years. It was he who subsequently kidnapped and threatened the offender, leading to his conviction and imprisonment.  
     
      
    38 The offender did poorly at school and left at the age of 15. Since then she has acquired no training or skills, and has had no productive employment. 
     
      
    39 As I have already mentioned, the offender started to take marijuana or cannabis at the age of 12 and was already a heavy user at the age of 13. To quote Mr Watson-Munro, â€œin the absence of treatment for her already blossoming psychological problems, this drug offered her significant emotional release and in this setting she rapidly became addicted to itâ€. She remained addicted until her arrest and incarceration for this offence. 
     
      
    40 The offenderâ€™s children are being cared for in Barnardoâ€™s Homes. She has been separated from them since her incarceration. This has undoubtedly imposed a significant additional burden for her. 
     
      
    41 The offender has no prior convictions. This is a significant matter in her favour on sentence. 
     
      
    42 There are a number of mitigating features arising from the offenderâ€™s personal history. They are: 
     
      
    Â· her plea of guiltyÂ· her prior good characterÂ· her prospects of rehabilitationÂ· her youthÂ· her expressed remorse. 
     
      
    43 I have already referred to the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was entered. It was a late plea, but nevertheless had some real utilitarian value. I propose to reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 12.5% on account of this plea. 
     
      
    44 The next three factors, namely, the offenderâ€™s prior good character, her prospects of rehabilitation and her youth, are all interrelated. Given the offenderâ€™s sad and disjointed upbringing, her time on the streets working as a prostitute, and the extent and duration of her cannabis addiction, it is somewhat of a surprise, even for a person so young, that she has no prior convictions. This must, as Mr Ramage submitted, stand her in good stead so far as her prospects of rehabilitation are concerned. I think I must assume that, if she can remain drug free, her prospects of rehabilitation will be good. She will be a different person when she comes out of prison, approximately twice the age that she was when she first met the deceased. She will, however, require a great deal of assistance and support. It is therefore appropriate that there be a significant period of parole. This constitutes special circumstances which break the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the total sentence. However, given the length of the overall sentence I am obliged to impose, this factor will not significantly affect the pattern of the sentence. 
     
      
    45 The offender has expressed remorse for this killing. The Crown submitted that I should not accept the genuineness of these statements of remorse, particularly given the concerted attempts the offender made to cover her tracks after the killing. However, as Mr Ramage pointed out, the fact that she attempted to escape detection for this crime is not necessarily inconsistent with remorse. I think I should give her the benefit of the doubt on this matter and treat her expressed remorse as genuine. 
     
      
    46 An extremely moving victim impact statement was read in court by the deceasedâ€™s mother, Mrs Jean Harrison. I would like to convey the Courtâ€™s and my own sincere condolences to the relatives of the deceased, particularly his parents who are here and who have been devastated by his death. 
     
      
    47 The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years. This has no direct application following a plea of guilty, but it remains a reference point in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    48 This is one of those cases where the major sentencing considerations point in different directions. Those relating to the offence itself almost all point in one direction, which is towards a heavier sentence. Those relating to the offender personally almost all point in the opposite direction, which is towards a lighter one. 
     
      
    49 The offender has been in custody since 17 July 2007 and her sentence must commence on that date. 
     
      
    50 Emma Barrett, for the murder of David Harrison, I sentence you to imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing on 17 July 2007 and expiring on 16 July 2023. That will be the first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole. I specify an additional term of six years, commencing on 17 July 2023 and expiring on 16 July 2029.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. I am sentencing Justin James Martin for the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. That is an offence under s25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
       and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. The drugs to which that particular section apply do not include cannabis and in this case the drugs which were being supplied on an ongoing basis were methylamphetamine. Mr Martin pleaded guilty, it is accepted, at the earliest opportunity. 
       
       
      2. Briefly this is what happened. Mr Martin was identified by the police intelligence as a supplier of amphetamines in the Armidale area. Police set up an operation involving undercover operatives. Those undercover operatives made contact with Mr Martin over a period of some days and he supplied them with drugs on each of the days. 
       
       
      3. On 11 September 2006 he supplied them with .2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $80. On 12 September 2006 he supplied the same amount of drugs for the same amount of money. On the same day the undercover operative received a text message from Mr Martin indicating that he, Mr Martin, could organise the supply of further methylamphetamine from another source. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with .4 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $100. The next day, 13 September 2006, the amount was increased again. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with 31/2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $750. The final supply was on 19 September 2006, once again the quantity was increased. The undercover operatives handed Mr Martin $1,300 and in return he supplied them with 7 grams of methylamphetamine.  
       
       
      4. On the same day they indicated that they would pay $2,400 for 14 grams. Some days later a transaction occurred in which that amount of methylamphetamine was supplied in exchange for $2,400. On the day of that supply, which was 26 September 2006, the police terminated the operation and arrested Mr Martin. He made full admissions in his record of interview after his arrest. 
       
       
      5. The offences, I have said, carry a maximum of twenty years. In  
      Regina v Smiroldo 
       (2000) 112 A Crim R 47, Hulme J, with whom Sheller JA and Dowd J agreed, discussed s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      ,  
       
        
         
          
          â€œ 
          It was introduced 
          â€, his Honour said, â€œ 
          to target dealers who had organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of the drug legislation by dealing only in small quantities at a time 
          .â€ 
           
          
         
        
       
      His Honour observed that the Minister said that the quantity of drugs supplied was, so far as s 25A was concerned, immaterial. On the other hand Hulme J pointed out that obviously, in accordance with sentencing principle, the amount or the quantity of the drug should be a relevant factor for sentencing. 
       
        
         
          
          â€œ 
          It would be relevant to consider 
          â€, his Honour said at [14], â€œ 
          whether an offender, convicted of an offence under the section had sold three lots of 1 kilogram each or three lots of 1 gram. 
          â€ 
          
         
        
       
      His Honour went on to say in the following paragraph 
       
       
        
         
          
          â€œ 
          The persons at whom s 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation 
          .â€ 
           
          
         
        
       
      6. In this case the magnitude of the operation was relatively modest. As Mr Falcomata, who appears for Mr Martin, pointed out, the overall quantity of the drugs involved were some 10 grams, that is twice the indictable amount. It was, he pointed out, significantly below the commercial quantity, which is 250 grams. It was, it seems, a relatively small scale street enterprise. In addition it is to be noted that in accordance with the evidence of Mr Martin, whom Mr Falcomata called to give evidence, the remuneration he received for his drug supplying activities was in the form of helping himself to the drug which was supplied, a process referred to as taxing. On the other hand it is clear that Mr Martin was prepared to increase the amounts which he sold in response to the demand of those to whom he was selling it. He did not appear to baulk at the opportunity of increasing the amount sold. 
       
       
      7. Mr Martin, so far as his personal factors are concerned, has pleaded guilty, as I have indicated. Not only that but he has told the police that he is prepared to give evidence against the person supplying him, a man named Shane Young. That person is facing trial and there is, amongst the exhibits, an undertaking by Mr Martin that he will give evidence against Mr Young. He confirmed that, at least in skeletal outline, in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. 
       
       
      8. Mr Martin has no record of previous offending for this type of behaviour. His record contains only a couple of traffic matters. He is therefore not in need of a particularly strong degree of personal deterrence, which would be the case for someone with a criminal record which was relevant. 
       
       
      9. There was also tendered in the proceedings a pre-sentence report. It refers to Mr Martinâ€™s history of drug taking, which was confirmed by Mr Martin in his own evidence. In his own evidence he indicated that he had used alcohol and cannabis from a young age. He stopped drinking alcohol after his second traffic conviction. He smoked cannabis for about five years. He was drug free for some years from 2002, but in 2005 commenced to use amphetamines. He became addicted fairly quickly. 
       
       
      10. Whilst I am referring to his evidence, he has a child, a boy named Corey, born on 16 April 2005. The mother of his son has moved to Western Australia. She moved some five months ago because Mr Martin was in prison. It is clear that Mr Martin is attached to his son emotionally and misses the opportunity to see him. Mr Martin assures me that he will remain drug free and will not commit this sort of offence again. Whilst he has been in remand he has seen a counsellor concerning his drug activity and he is going to be or has been assessed for a residential drug rehabilitation facility called The Glen. 
       
       
      11. Returning to the pre-sentence report, it says that he, Mr Martin, 
       
        
         
          
          â€œ 
          recognises that he will encounter different pressures upon his return to the community, and the environment of a residential rehabilitation facility may allow him to develop strategies which will assist him to remain drug free 
          .â€ 
           
          
         
        
       
      It noted that he appeared genuine in his expressions of remorse. It offered an opportunity to supervise Mr Martin and to monitor his progress and performance. It assessed him as suitable for both Community Service and Periodic Detention. He has demonstrated his interest in rehabilitation by the courses which he has undertaken in prison, as well as by a previous course which he undertook concerning persons who drive with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood. I note that he ceased drinking alcohol after one of those offences.  
       
       
      12. Mr Falcomata called Ms Cheryl Jones, Mr Martinâ€™s mother. She noticed an improvement in her son since he has been in custody and made it clear that on his release, she will provide a home for him and support his rehabilitation. 
       
       
      13. So the question is what sentence I should impose upon Mr Martin. Mr Falcomata submits that a non parole period in the order of eighteen months would be appropriate, and the Crown Prosecutor does not add anything by way of submissions apart from reminding me to bear in mind the discount and the appropriate stage at which to apply it. 
       
       
      14. This is a serious offence created, as I said, by Parliament to target those who make it a business to sell drugs in the community. That is exactly the business that Mr Martin was engaged in. The fact that he did not derive a benefit in the form of money but instead in the form of drugs for his own use, does not reduce the fact that he was engaged in a business. The fact that he was being paid small amounts in the form of supporting his own drug addiction does reduce the criminality of the behaviour, nevertheless he was prepared to increase the amounts in accordance with demand. 
       
       
      15. Parliament, as I said, has fixed a maximum penalty of some twenty years imprisonment for this sort of offending. Taking into account that the overall amounts supplied by Mr Martin were relatively small and that the business enterprise was relatively small in its scale. In my opinion an appropriate commencing place before discounts for an offence such as this, is less than the halfway figure of ten years, and it seems to me that a figure of eight years overall imprisonment would be an appropriate starting place.  
       
       
      16. However Mr Martin has pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse and has also indicated that he is prepared to assist the authorities. Mr Falcomata has referred me to s 23 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        
      and I have taken into account the relevant factors there. In accordance with the authorities it seems to me that an appropriate discount is in the region of forty percent for his combined assistance and the plea of guilty, including remorse. This reduces the overall sentence to something over four and a half years.  
       
       
      17. However I also take into account that his prospects of rehabilitation appear to be quite good. He has demonstrated in the past his capacity for rehabilitation and his prospects on being released from prison are good because of his close and supporting relationship with his mother. In addition he is serving, so far, his custody in protection. That is because of his size, he is a relatively small stature, and his lack of confidence. He will therefore serve his term of imprisonment in somewhat harsher conditions or more deprived conditions than might otherwise have been the case. 
       
       
      18. Taking these various factors into account, I am prepared to further reduce the sentence to just over three years. I have in mind, as the overall penalty, a sentence of forty months. Mr Falcomata invited me to set a parole period which is longer than the normal statutory ratio. There are, I am satisfied, special circumstances which warrant this. In this case his need for supervised rehabilitation would be assisted or promoted by a longer than normal parole period. I am therefore going to set a non parole period of twenty months. The sentences will all date from the date of his arrest, 26 September 2006. 
       
       
      19. So Mr Martin I am going to sentence you to an overall period of three years and four months, that is forty months, commencing 26 September 2006 and concluding on 25 January 2010. I set a non parole period for the sentence, which is the minimum period that you have to be kept in detention, of one year and eight months, that is twenty months, to commence on 26 September 2006 and to expire on 25 May 2010. The balance of the term is also to be one year and eight months, that is twenty months, it will commence on 26 May 2008 and expire on 25 January 2010. The earliest date at which it appears that you will be eligible for release to parole is therefore 25 May 2008. 
       
       
      So I do not make a parole order, do I gentlemen, because it is over three years. 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes thatâ€™s right. 
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Nor do I fix conditions. I think that is probably all Mr Crown-- 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --and Mr Falcomata. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thereâ€™s no other orders I need to make. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Martin do you understand you have been sentenced to three years and four months, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: That is forty months, it all dates from when you were arrested on 26 September last year, half you must serve, the other half on parole, and that is provided the Parole Board releases you. I cannot order that, it is a matter for the Parole Board or the Parole Authority, but you will become eligible to be considered for release on parole on 25 May 2008 and your overall sentence after parole expires 25 January 2010, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
       
       oOo

definitively on whether a circumcision performed by a person without medical
training can ever be considered reasonable and in the childâ€™s best interest.

2767076,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sribounheuang [2015] NSWSC 901,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 3 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1) of the Act that certain funds be transferred to an account held by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all interest of the defendant in the property specified in Schedule One; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff, within 21 days, a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendantâ€™s illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 3 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	



	
	Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015; and
	
	
	Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 3 July 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).
	



	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


â€œ10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)Â Â Â Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

â€¦

(3)Â Â Â The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)Â Â Â Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)Â Â Â Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)Â Â Â in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)Â Â Â the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activitiesâ€¦

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based â€¦

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.â€


	
	The plaintiffâ€™s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1).
	
	
	The plaintiffâ€™s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA). These are serious criminal offences within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the DMTA are â€œdrug trafficking offencesâ€. The Facts Sheet records that the defendant was charged with the offences described therein on 2 July 2015 following the execution of search warrants at premises at Blair Athol, New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He deposed to a conversation he had with Detective Christopher Eisenhuth, who had prepared the Facts Sheet on the basis of information provided by investigating police officers. Detective Eisenhuth informed Mr Spark that the facts set out are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he caused to be made into the defendantâ€™s bank accounts.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that Mr Sparkâ€™s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Sparkâ€™s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Sparkâ€™s evidence. I accept Mr Sparkâ€™s evidence as to the speed with funds can be concealed or disposed of, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendantâ€™s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.
	


Orders


	
	Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor being noted) and;

		08 July 2015",2/7/2015 0:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708726,Tattersall v R [2011] NSWCCA 282,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of detaining Steven Jiminez without his consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely psychological, and at the time of detaining, actual bodily harm was occasioned to Jiminez. The offence was contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty being 25 years imprisonment.  2The sentencing judge was also required to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of deem supply of a prohibited drug, being 5.3 grams of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 (NSW).  3The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 14 years and 5 months comprising a non-parole period of 11 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 5 months. There are two grounds of appeal being:  Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in having regard to material that was not in evidence before him.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive.  4The facts were not in dispute and are as follows:  5The co-offender Nadia Donn befriended a woman called Amanda Sutton in 2006. Both had interests in common and through those interests met the applicant. Sutton became involved in a relationship with the applicant and they moved into a house together. The victim in this matter is Stephen Jimenez. At about this time he was living in Nowra and befriended the co-offenders being Ben Thomas and his girlfriend Nadia Donn. Donn and Thomas introduced Jimenez to Sutton and the applicant. Jimenez eventually moved to Warilla, a suburb of Wollongong.  6Shortly thereafter the applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. Donn spent a lot of time with Sutton whilst the applicant was in custody. She encouraged Sutton to take up with Jimenez and before long Sutton and Jimenez developed a casual sexual relationship. The applicant was released from custody on 20 February 2010 and stayed in a caravan in his brother's backyard in Nowra. At this time Donn fell out with Sutton and told the applicant's brother about Sutton's sexual relationship with Stephen Jimenez. She expected that information to get back to the applicant.  7At about 9pm on Monday 22 February 2010 the applicant arrived at Donn's house. The applicant asked Thomas if he had been ""rooting Sutton"". Donn said ""No it was junior, Stephen (being the victim) and Dwayne"". The applicant directed Donn and Thomas to attend his caravan. When they got there the applicant took Jimenez's number from Donn's phone. The applicant called the number. Donn and Thomas heard the applicant talking to someone on the phone and becoming very agitated. He appeared to be speaking to someone called Rob. At the time the victim Jimenez was visiting Rob Menz at William Avenue, Warilla. At about 9.30pm Jimenez's mobile phone rang. Menz picked it up and answered. He heard a male voice ask ""Where's Amanda?"" Menz replied ""Hang on buddy, this is not Stephen, I just answered his phone"". The male then said ""I'm looking for Amanda. Is Stephen with Amanda? I just got out of gaol, I don't even have any clothes, I want to know where my things are"". Menz replied ""No they haven't been together since new year"". The male asked ""Where is he?"" Menz replied ""Dunno"".  8The phone rang again and was answered this time by Jimenez. The male asked ""Where are you?"" Jimenez replied ""In Fairy Meadow"". The male said:  ""Were you with my missus cunt? I'm coming to get you. You're not at Fairy Meadow are you cunt, you're at William Street aren't you cunt. Stay put I'm coming to get you cunt. I'll be there in twenty minutes, I'm leaving now"".  9The applicant then directed Donn and Thomas to pick up Jimenez. They were joined by another co-offender Shaun Burne. Donn drove the three of them back to her house where they changed cars and then Thomas drove them to William Avenue, Warilla in his Mitsubishi Magna station wagon. In the meantime Jimenez drove to Warilla Police Station to report the applicant's threat. H e returned to Menz's home in William Avenue. While he was there he received a call from a male calling himself ""Jason."" The male said he would be at the house in twenty minutes. Jimenez went and sat in his car so that he could drive to the police station if need be. He waited for an hour and then phoned Donn. The male who called himself ""Jason"" answered the phone. He confirmed that they were on their way and said ""You want to be there cunt"".  10Shortly thereafter Jimenez heard a car pull up in the street. He saw Donn and Thomas sitting in Thomas's Magna station wagon. He also saw another male in the back seat of the car. Donn and Thomas saw him and yelled out ""Are you coming or what?"" Jimenez replied, ""I don't know, who is that?"" Burne replied, ""I'm Shaun, Jason's cousin. Are you going to get in the car? The longer you keep Jason waiting the shiftier he gets.""  11Jimenez then agreed to follow them in his red Daihatsu Charade. They travelled in convoy to Albion Park. At one point Jimenez phoned Donn to ask where they were going. Thomas answered the phone and told him ""Jason is already at a house and he's waiting for us. We are driving there"". Jimenez said ""I want to meet in a public place"". Thomas replied ""We can't do that, it will make him more shitty. You are better off just going there"".  12When they arrived at Albion Park both cars stopped and Burne got into Jimenez's car. They then drove to the home of the co-offender Matthew Bool and Stephanie Ireland at 5 Murragan Street, Albion Park Rail. The applicant had earlier phoned Bool to tell him that he was coming over to his house with a couple of his mates. He turned up on his motorbike at about midnight. Once inside he told Bool and Ireland, ""I've got something to do. We got to go fucking sort this fellow out"".  13The others arrived a short time later. They were met by the applicant who said to Jimenez ""Get in here now cunt"". Jimenez walked into the house. He was followed closely by Thomas, Donn and Burne. The applicant punched him in the head as he walked past. Jimenez was then told to stand in the kitchen area and was then punched causing him to fall to the floor. He was then punched and kicked by the applicant as Thomas, Donn and Burne sat around the kitchen area watching. At some point the applicant told Thomas to get a baseball bat from the car. Thomas left and then returned with a baseball bat. The applicant started to hit Jimenez with the baseball bat and then he continued to hit and kick the victim whilst the others watched.  14At one point Jimenez heard something crack in his left ankle and felt a burst of intense pain in his left leg. He screamed and was told by the applicant to ""Shut the fuck up, you're going to wake up the kids"". There were five children in the house aged two, four, six, ten and eleven. They were sleeping in the back bedroom. Ireland checked on the children about eight or nine times during the night, otherwise she remained with the others.  15A little while later the applicant told Jimenez to get up and go out to the backyard. Jimenez picked himself up from the kitchen floor and limped out to the backyard. Once outside the applicant screamed at Jimenez, ""Have you learnt your lesson cunt. I'm going to overdose you on heroin and leave you to die cunt"". The applicant started hitting him with a baseball bat again. Jimenez fell to the ground. After a time the applicant said, ""That's what a dirty cunt gets"".  16At this point the offender Shaun Burne said ""It's my turn now, it's my turn now"". The applicant made Jimenez stand up. Burne then punched Jimenez about five times and then kicked him in the ribs. Jimenez fell to the ground again. Burne then said, ""Get back inside you dumb little cunt"". Back inside the house the applicant asked Bool to get his tattoo gun so that he could write ""dog"" on Jimenez's forehead. Ireland got the tattoo gun and gave it to Bool who in turn set it up and gave it to the applicant. Jimenez was made to lie on the kitchen floor as the applicant used his right hand to tattoo the word ""dog"" on his forehead. He took about ten minutes. Burne was standing nearby. Donn, Thomas and Bool were sitting nearby.  17When the applicant was finished tattooing Jimenez's forehead he and Burne again hit Jimenez. Donn was sitting nearby looking at a tattoo book. The applicant made a number of telephone calls to Robert Menz during the early hours of that morning. During the calls Menz could hear Jimenez getting ""flogged"". At one point the applicant said, ""Your mate's having fun here, you're next, this is going to happen to you"". Jimenez was also forced to sign over ownership of his Daihatsu Charade to the applicant. The document to be signed was prepared by Donn. Thomas drove the vehicle away from the scene in an attempt to conceal it.  18Jimenez was then taken out to the backyard in the early hours of the morning. Bool directed him to sit on a chair in the carport. The applicant asked him, ""What are you meant to say now cunt?"" Jimenez replied, ""Thank you for stopping and I'm sorry for what I've done"". Some time later the applicant said to Jimenez:  ""Ben and Nadia are going to take you to a Sydney hospital. This is what you are going to say. You got bashed by five or six wogs in a park and that you signed your car over to a friend earlier today and Ben and Nadia found you in a park. I will kill you and come after your family if you tell the cops"".  19At about 7.30am Donn and Thomas drove Jimenez to Wollongong Hospital in Thomas' car. With his significant injuries Jimenez had difficulty walking so Donn and Thomas helped him into the hospital and left him with the triage nurse. They then drove to Campbelltown trying to find the address of the person referred to as ""junior"" for the applicant. The applicant left about twenty minutes after Thomas and Donn. He phoned Bool some time later and told him to get rid of the tattoo gun. Ireland took the tattoo gun and put it into a friend's garbage bin.  20At about 11am Donn and Thomas stopped at 5 Murragan Street on their way back from Campbelltown and picked up the baseball bat. They were joined by Bool and Burne. They then went to the place where Thomas had concealed Jimenez's Daihatsu Charade. Thomas drove the Charade to Kiama bends lookout where he dumped it and was then picked up by Donn, Bool and Burne and driven home to Nowra.  21Jimenez was examined at Wollongong Hospital. He had a painful left ankle, left forearm and right elbow. X-rays revealed a fractured left ankle. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left ankle on 26 February 2010 and it was put into a back slab. The injury was consistent with a direct blow to the ankle and surgery was required. He also had the word ""dog"" tattooed on his forehead in green ink.  22Dr Angelo Tsirbas, an ocular plastic surgeon reported that the victim has a severe disability in the vision of his left eye so as to be classed as legally blind in that eye.  23The sentencing judge described the factual circumstances as demonstrating ""the sickening nature of the offence."" His Honour was satisfied that the offender organised for several of his co-offenders to bring the victim to the premises in Murragan Street. Once inside the victim who was 18 years of age was outnumbered and vulnerable. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender then subjected the victim to a brutal bashing that commenced shortly after midnight and did not end until he was taken to the hospital at 7.30 am. Part of the brutality included a threat by the offender that he would be overdosed and left to die. The offender threatened the victim indicating that he and his family would be killed if he spoke to the police. The sentencing judge found that the offence was aggravated by a number of factors including the actual use of a weapon (the baseball bat) and that gratuitous cruelty was involved. His Honour also regarded the use of the tattoo gun as an aggravating feature. His Honour was satisfied that the victim suffered substantial injury and emotional harm well in excess of the actual bodily harm which his Honour described as an element of the offence. His Honour said:  ""During the period of about 7 hours, so completely broken was the spirit of the victim, that he ultimately told the offender what he believed the offender wanted to hear.""  24His Honour was also satisfied that:  ""Callous and calculating nature of the offending conduct was further demonstrated in the act of the offender telephoning Robert Menz, the victim's friend, so he could hear the screams of the victim in the background and threatening Menz this was going to happen to him.""  25His Honour found that the applicant was the ring leader of the criminal enterprise and that his co-offenders were in fear of him and concerned for their own safety if they opposed the applicant's actions. His Honour concluded that the case fell just outside the worst category of offence of its kind, but, mindful of the fact that the applicant had ordered his co-offenders to take the victim to hospital ultimately concluded that the offence ""falls towards the very high end of the range but just short of worst case category.""  26The applicant was aged 35 at the time of sentencing. He has a criminal record for a variety of offences including common assault, custody of a knife in a public place, contravening an apprehended violence order and driving whilst disqualified. He has on previous occasions breached his parole conditions. Following his previous incarceration he was released from custody on 20 February 2010. The offences the subject of the present proceedings were committed 2 days later.  27The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant's conduct ""displayed a viciousness and callousness not often seen."" His Honour said that ""when giving evidence I did not detect any feeling of sympathy for the victim's suffering during the offence or indeed empathy for the continuing psychological damage the victim would experience in the future."" His Honour concluded that he was unable to make a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation nor that he would be unlikely to re-offend.  28The applicant pleaded guilty and although the plea was entered at a relatively late stage his Honour allowed a discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of the plea. His Honour was not persuaded that there were special circumstances.  Ground 1: To that extent the trial judge's summary of the defence case was also inadequate.  29Under this ground of appeal the applicant challenges the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant was the ring leader and that his co-offenders were afraid for their own safety. It was submitted that the evidence could not support these findings and furthermore that the propositions were not put to the applicant during the course of his cross examination. It was submitted that accordingly his Honour erred in having regard to these matters in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.  30The sentencing judge was also responsible for sentencing the applicant's co-offenders. In the remarks on sentence for those offenders his Honour indicated that he was satisfied that each of the co-offenders had been afraid of the applicant at the time of the offence. It is apparent from the transcript of the hearing in relation to the applicant that when he gave evidence he was asked questions by his own counsel in which he acknowledged that he knew from the Crown case statement and from the material that his co-offenders tendered in their own proceedings, that the other offenders had said they were fearful of the applicant at the time Mr Jiminez was detained. In the course of submissions in this Court the applicant's counsel acknowledged that his Honour had sentenced the other offenders and was accordingly familiar with the circumstances of the offence. It was implicit if not expressed that counsel acknowledged that his Honour could have regard to his findings in the other proceedings when sentencing the applicant. Counsel acknowledged that he could not submit that the applicant should be sentenced at the level of the other offenders indicating ""that's clearly not an available submission, his role is significantly greater than that of the others who have been previously sentenced."" Counsel also acknowledged that his client had ""an extensive criminal history, extending over many years.""  31In these circumstances I am satisfied it was plain to the applicant's counsel that after having regard to all of the evidentiary material which counsel acknowledged was available to the sentencing judge his Honour would find that the applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise and that the co-offenders had participated because of threats made against them by the applicant. I am not satisfied that his Honour erred and would reject ground 1 of the appeal.  Ground 2: the sentence is manifestly excessive  32There can be no doubt that the applicant committed a very serious offence. The victim was seriously injured in the course of the events and has been left legally blind in his left eye. He was brutally bashed with a baseball bat and detained for more than 7 hours. Apart from the physical injuries he was threatened with death. Death threats were also made against his family if the matter was reported to the police.  33Apart from the other substantial physical injuries and emotional harm the applicant inflicted a large tattoo of the word ""dog"" on the victim's forehead. The applicant was the ring leader of the enterprise.  34The applicant said he committed the offence because he had felt ""a bit upset"" when he learned of the sexual relationship between his former partner and the victim. He also said that he was ""off his head"" on drugs or alcohol at the time. To my mind neither of these matters justified or ameliorated the seriousness of the offence. Apart from the primary offence his Honour also had to have regard to the matter on the Form 1. The offence was committed within 2 days of the applicant being released from custody having previously breached his parole. His objective circumstances include a criminal history which demonstrate persistent disregard for the law. The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant would not re-offend.  35In all of these circumstances I am not persuaded that the sentence which his Honour imposed was erroneously excessive.  36In the result I am of the opinion that the applicant's application was entirely without merit. I would refuse leave to appeal.  37LATHAM J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  38HARRISON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  **********

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Timothy Michael Donnelly (the applicant) returned to Australia from overseas at 7.30 am on 11 November 2004. He was a passenger on a British Airways flight from London via Singapore. Having cleared Customs, he went to a flat in Neutral Bay. 
     
      
    4 At approximately 2.50 pm on 13 November 2004, Mr Donnelly presented at the Emergency Department of the Royal North Shore Hospital. He complained of severe abdominal pain. He disclosed to medical staff that, before leaving London, he had swallowed a number of pellets made from plastic and ducting tape containing the drug ecstasy. He had already regurgitated a small number of the pellets. 
     
      
    5 An x-ray was undertaken and revealed a large number of foreign objects in the stomach and intestines. He was suffering from severe abdominal obstruction and required immediate surgery. 
     
      
    6 The police were notified. At 4.45 pm Mr Donnelly underwent a laparotomy. Sixty-five pellets were removed. The operation was witnessed by the police who took possession of the pellets. 
     
      
    7 Later the same evening, the police searched Mr Donnelly's flat at Neutral Bay. The person with whom Mr Donnelly shared the flat handed the police a further 12 pellets, being the pellets he had regurgitated the previous day. 
     
      
    8 Each pellet was later examined. There were 77 pellets in all, each weighing about 5 mgs. One pellet contained 4.7 grams of cocaine. The remaining 76 contained the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) in powder form. 
     
      
    9 On Sunday 14 November 2004, the police spoke to Mr Donnelly at the hospital. He was informed that he was under arrest for the possession of prohibited imports. He was also formally cautioned. 
     
      
    10 On 17 November 2004, a bedside court was conducted. Once discharged from hospital, Mr Donnelly remained in custody. Pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 2 February 2005. When the matter came before Nield DCJ on 22 April 2005, the charges were reformulated and can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : That on 11 November 2004, he was in possession of a prohibited import, contrary to s233B(1)(a)(vi) of the Customs Act 1901, namely ecstasy, in an amount not less than the trafficable quantity of that drug. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : Further, that on the same day and contrary to the same section, he was in possession of the prohibited import cocaine, in a quantity not less than the trafficable quantity. 
        
       
      
    11 The Commonwealth Act, unlike the State Act, is concerned with the quantity of pure drug imported. In each case the drugs had a high level of purity, namely: 
     
      
    Â· Ecstasy: 278.69 grams pure MDMA (representing over 77% of the 362.3 grams imported). 
     
      
    Â· Cocaine: 3.9 grams pure (representing 84.6% of the 4.7 grams imported). 
     
      
    12 A ""trafficable quantity"" of MDMA or ecstasy under the Customs Act is 0.5 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 500 grams. Accordingly, as noted by his Honour, the amount imported exceeded by many times the trafficable quantity and was over half of a commercial quantity. 
     
      
    13 In the case of cocaine, a ""trafficable quantity"" is 2 grams and a ""commercial quantity"" is 2 kilograms. The amount imported, therefore, was just over the trafficable quantity. 
     
      
       
      Issues before the Sentencing Judge. 
       
      
    14 As mentioned, Mr Donnelly came before Judge Nield in the District Court on 22 April 2005 for sentence. He was represented by Mr Sutherland SC. In an opening address, counsel identified the issue. The penalty section under the Customs Act, s235(2)(d)(i), at that time fixed a maximum penalty in respect of each charge of a fine not exceeding $550,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both. However, where the Court is satisfied (the onus being upon the offender) that the offence was not ""for a purpose related to the sale of, or other commercial dealing in, the drugs"", the maximum penalty for each offence was a fine not exceeding $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both (s235(3) and s235(2)(e)) (since repealed). It was Mr Donnelly's case that the drugs were imported for his personal use. They were not imported with a view to sale.  
     
      
    15 The sentencing proceedings, which I will shortly describe, continued over a number of days. His Honour reserved his judgment. On 12 August 2005 he passed sentence. I will examine his reasons shortly. He expressed his conclusion in these terms: (ROS paras 29/30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""29. I am not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use. On the contrary, the quantity of MDMA that he imported into Australia and the value, both wholesale value and street value, of the tablets that could be produced from that quantity of MDMA powder suggest, quite obviously, that he imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially. 
        
       
       
        
        30. However, on the other hand, as the quantity is small and the potential street value is small, I am satisfied that the offender imported the cocaine for his own use, to use his words 'for a bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour therefore sentenced Mr Donnelly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : Imprisonment for 6 years 9 months commencing on 13 November 2004 expiring on 12 August 2011; with a non parole period of 4 years commencing on 13 November 2004 and expiring on 12 November 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : A concurrent sentence of 11 months and 7 days. 
        
       
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    17 The Notice of Appeal identified four grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    18 Before dealing with the arguments, I should describe the evidence given during the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Proceedings. 
       
      
    19 When the sentencing proceedings began on 22 April 2005, the Crown tendered a number of documents. There was no issue concerning the circumstances of importation. The agreed facts included the following material as to the value of the drugs imported. In respect of cocaine, the following was said: (AB p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Based on a figure of between $200 and $300 per gram for impure cocaine, the street value of the cocaine seized from the Defendant is about $2,228 and $2,340."" 
        
       
      
    20 As to the ecstasy, the agreed facts were in these terms: (AB p12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Imported MDMA tablets normally have a purity of 30% to 50% and a weight of 0.2 to 0.3 of a gram. Using this range, an ecstasy tablet has from 0.06 to 0.15 of a gram of pure MDMA. The MDMA powder would produce between 3095 (0.3 gram) to 4643 (0.2 gram) tablets at 30% purity. The MDMA powder would produce between 1857 (03. gram) to 2786 (0.2 gram) tablets at 50% purity. 
        
       
       
        
        In November 2004, the street value of MDMA tablets in NSW ranged from $30 to $60 with $50 being the more typical price. Based on these figures, the street value of the MDMA is between $92,850 and $232,150. Based on a figure of $20 per tablet for MDMA as a bulk price, the wholesale value of the MDMA is between $37,140 and $92,860."" 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown also tendered a statement by Det Sgt Stipnieks, an officer in the Australian Federal Police experienced in drug matters. Sgt Stipnieks said that commercial importations of ecstasy in powder form were extremely rare (8.7.05: T2). Ecstasy was soluble. It could be ingested by snorting or in liquid form. When cross examined by counsel for Mr Donnelly, Sgt Stipnieks said this: (8.7.05: T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. There would need to be a refining and/or manufacturing process undertaken by somebody to turn it into the tablet form? 
         
        A. No, it would only require a pill press. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It would require firstly somebody to cut it with an appropriate substance -- 
         
        A. It could be cut down further from the imported seizure, yes. I agree with that."" 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown also tendered a report of the Probation and Parole Service dated 21 April 2005. The report included a history of Mr Donnelly's involvement with drugs. Mr Donnelly, in his evidence, enlarged upon that history. His Honour, in his remarks, accepted that Mr Donnelly had, in the years preceding 11 November 2004, a significant involvement with drugs. His Honour said this: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""5. Whilst at the senior school at Newington College, he commenced to smoke cannabis and to use other prohibited drugs. Whilst at school, he was able to keep his use of prohibited drugs hidden and under control."" 
        
       
      
    23 Having left school, the applicant worked for his father. His drug use increased. His Honour continued: (ROS 2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""7. Then, during 1996, he was driving a motor vehicle which was involved in a collision with a cliff face on the Sydney-Newcastle freeway, which collision resulted in the death of his girlfriend. A search of his car revealed that he was in possession of prohibited drugs and analysis of a sample of his blood revealed that he had been driving the car with MDMA, commonly called ecstasy, in his blood. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs. He was dealt with for the offences of dangerous driving causing death and possession of prohibited drugs at the end of 1997. He was sentenced to imprisonment for one year six months, with a non-parole period of twelve months to be served by home detention, and a parole period of six months, for the offence of dangerous driving causing death and he was fined $1,000 for each of the two offences of possessing a prohibited drug."" 
        
       
      
    24 Having completed his sentence, Mr Donnelly resumed the use of prohibited drugs, principally ecstasy. He said he used them ""on a recreational basis"" (22.4.05: T14). In 2001 he moved to London. He gave the following history to the Probation Officer concerning his drug use once in London: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly reported that after moving to London in 2001 he began using ecstasy and cocaine heavily. After the death of his father, in mid 2003, his usage increased, particularly ecstasy usage. He claimed he was using round 1 gram of ecstasy daily."" 
        
       
      
    25 After his father's death, Mr Donnelly received an inheritance of $100,000 and an annuity of $30,000. He travelled extensively. He had a Brazilian girlfriend and spent some time in South America and Europe, where he continued his use of drugs. He squandered much of his inheritance. The Probation Officer concluded her report in these terms: (AB p19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Donnelly has had a longstanding problem with abuse of illicit drugs; which appears to be a substantial factor in his motivation to commit the offences."" 
        
       
      
    26 As mentioned, his Honour accepted that Mr Donnelly was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy before the offence (ROS para 28). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant's Evidence. 
       
      
    27 The applicant's credibility was obviously fundamental if he hoped to persuade his Honour (on the balance of probabilities) that the drugs he imported were for his own use. Whilst he was a heavy drug user, the amount of ecstasy imported (362.3 grams) was very substantial. When first called to give evidence, the applicant sought to explain that amount by the following evidence: (22.4.05: T20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And did you continue your usage of ecstasy in London? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How much ecstasy would you take in a day? 
         
        A. In powder form anywhere up to a gram. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about in tablet form? 
         
        A. I very rarely took tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now there's not a lot of powder form ecstasy seen in this country, how do you use it in powder form? 
         
        A. You can snort it or eat it, mix it with drinks."" 
        
       
      
    28 His evidence continued: (22.4.05: T22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. And so far as the ecstasy was concerned the quantity that you purchased I think in bulk terms is about 360-odd grams -- 
         
        A. That's correct."" 
        
       
      
    29 Mr Donnelly then said this: (22.4.05: T22/23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... Did you propose to sell any of that ecstasy? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you propose to do with it? 
         
        A. To use it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long did you think, without using a slide rule and a calculator, but how long did you think it would last? 
         
        A. I figured about a year."" 
        
       
      
    30 The evidence that he used a gram a day, in the context of an importation of 362.3 grams and 365 days in a year, was an important aspect of Mr Donnelly's testimony. His evidence continued as follows: (22.4.05: T23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SUTHERLAND: Q. How regularly were you using a gram a day? 
         
        A. Almost every day of the week, it varied, on weekends I'd use more, some days I'd use less. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I appreciate this comes from your perception as opposed to an external perception but what effect on your day to day life did it have? 
         
        A. Well it seemed normal at the time. Looking back on it with a clear head it had a pretty detrimental effect. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But how did you perceive it at the time? 
         
        A. I felt pretty normal to be honest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And for what period of time or what length in your life had you been using effectively a gram a day? 
         
        A. Two or three years, two years."" 
        
       
      
    31 During cross examination by the Crown, his Honour asked a number of questions, including the following: (22.4.05: T33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. Did you know the purity of the MDMA that you'd purchased? 
         
        A. I'd tested it but I didn't know what the purity is mathematically. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It exceeds seventy per cent, you know that now? 
         
        A. I do now yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that's greater than the street percentage isn't it? 
         
        A. I don't know what the street percentage is to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour also asked the following questions: (22.4.05: T34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Q. What the Crown Prosecutor is asking you is that you know that MDMA is usually sold in tablet form? 
         
        A. Yes sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you know that tablets are made from powder? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the tablets that are made from powder have an admixture of MDMA and other things, you know that don't you? 
         
        A. I've heard that happens yeah sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know you could have cut the powder that you brought into Australia by fifty per cent, don't you? 
         
        A. I never even considered it to be honest."" 
        
       
      
    33 At the end of the examination, Mr Sutherland, counsel for Mr Donnelly, said this: (22.4.05: T38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your Honour if I can candidly say I was just a little concerned in relation to some of the questions from your Honour as to whether or not in the circumstances your Honour might be assisted by some pharmacological evidence which I don't have available today ..."" 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Sutherland continued: (T39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I must say my perception sitting here and just listening to the few questions that your Honour did ask gave me cause for pause to think that maybe that is evidence of a kind that might be of some assistance to your Honour if your Honour were felt weighed down by the healthy judicial scepticism, based on experience of course, of the purity of this particular substance."" 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour acknowledged that Mr Sutherland's perception was right and that he was sceptical (T39). The matter was adjourned to enable the applicant to place before the Court pharmacological evidence as foreshadowed by Mr Sutherland.  
     
      
    36 The proceedings resumed on 8 July 2005. A report had, in the meantime, been procured from Associate Professor Starmer, the professor of pharmacology at the University of Sydney. Professor Starmer's report included these words: (AB 38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""14. The residual effects after MDMA (75 - 150 mg) include exhaustion, fatigue, depression, nausea, numbness, feelings of coldness, anxiety attacks, persistent insomnia, rage reactions, psychosis and, possibly, flashbacks. The residual effects of MDMA may persist for period of several hours up to two weeks after drug ingestion. Users develop a rapid tolerance to MDMA. Most users will therefore (for financial reasons) allow an interval of at least a week between doses of the drug. More frequent use of MDMA results in a reduction of the pleasant effects and an increase in the unpleasant effects of the drug. If Mr Donnelly planned to take ecstasy tablets every day, the desired effects are likely to have become progressively less evident. ..."" 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Donnelly was recalled. He described, for the first time, certain adverse side effects of ecstasy. The examination in chief was in these terms: (8.7.05: T2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When your usage increased, and I think you explained to his Honour initially upwards of something in the order of five days a week or thereabouts? 
         
        A. Sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did the increased usage, that is where you were not having a gap of four or five or days or a week in between usage. What difference if any did that make to you? 
         
        A. Well, the drug would work again. It stops working when you do it every day over a period of time, so you need to take a couple of days off to make it work properly again. You start to feel pretty, pretty sick after a while as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am sorry, I missed that last -- ? 
         
        A. You start to feel pretty sick after long periods of using it."" 
        
       
      
    38 Given these effects, Mr Donnelly described his practice in taking the drug in these terms: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. If you got to the stage during your heavy usage where you were feeling nauseous and sick, so you took a day or a couple of days off, would you be off the drug completely or would you use it in any way? 
         
        A. I'd still taste a little bit or snort a tiny amount even on days off, but just enough to get the taste and the feel, not really for a drugs effect."" 
        
       
      
    39 He was asked about Professor Starmer's report: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You understand that during the adjournment period, your solicitor has obtained from Professor Starmer as you just saw me tender --? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- a report. Have you seen that report? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    40 When cross examined, Mr Donnelly said this: (T5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Sir, you said that you have not seen this report by Professor Starmer? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you discussed it with your legal representatives at all? 
         
        A. I spoke briefly to Michael Kirby this morning."" 
        
       
      
    41 When questioned further, Mr Donnelly added: (T5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you talk about how the report indicates that people who use MDMA more frequently than once a week tend to have a result where the pleasant effect is reduced and there is an increase in the unpleasant effects? 
         
        A. He -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you discuss that? 
         
        A. -- he read me a small excerpt from the report, I think that was one of the lines yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did discuss that? 
         
        A. Yeah he read me a small excerpt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you also discuss the unpleasant, what those unpleasant effects are for example, depression, restlessness, nausea, did you discuss those things? 
         
        A. No I don't think so."" 
        
       
      
    42 It was put to Mr Donnelly that he had changed his account, and had tailored his evidence so that it did not conflict with that of Professor Starmer. He denied that suggestion, providing the following explanation: (T7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. No what I've done is I've taken the average of say I was using seven grams a week and just divided it by the days. I was using the drug every day and mostly I'd be using a gram a day."" 
        
       
      
    43 Against this background, let me turn to the grounds of appeal. It is convenient to deal with a number of grounds together. 
     
      
       
      Arguments on Appeal. 
       
       
      (a) That the sentencing judge failed to give any or any sufficient reasons for finding that he was not satisfied that the offender imported the MDMA into Australia for his own personal use; and 
       
       
      (b) That the sentencing judge should have held that the maximum sentence applicable to each charge was a fine of $2,200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both (Customs Act 1901 section 235). 
       
       
      (c) That the sentence imposed exceeded the available statutory maximum. 
       
      
    44 Mr Glissan QC appeared for Mr Donnelly on the appeal. He submitted that the material before the sentencing Judge amounted to a powerful case that his motivation was personal, not commercial. He was a regular and heavy user of ecstasy, as his Honour accepted. He was psychologically dependant upon it. He could be expected to need the drug once he returned to Australia. It was much cheaper in London. Whilst he had a number of convictions, none related to drug dealing. Unusually, the drug was in powder form, rather than tablet form. He was in the habit of using the drug in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks had not previously heard of an importation of ecstasy in powder form. Sgt Stipnieks agreed that the drug was much more readily saleable and valuable in tablet form. There was no evidence that Mr Donnelly had a pill press or the know-how or connections to transform the drugs from powder to tablet. 
     
      
    45 These were all matters said to support his claim that he imported the drugs for personal use. They were matters in the applicant's submission, that his Honour was obliged to weigh and accept or reject. Instead, his Honour had, in the passage already quoted (para 29) (supra para 13), simply adverted to the quantity and value of the drugs imported. In written submissions, the applicant said this in respect of that approach: 
     
      
       
        
        ""22. These do not, it is submitted, amount to reasons at all. There was no issue about the quantity or the commercial value of the drug beyond that identified above. More, there was no evidentiary basis for linking the accused at any past time with other than personal use of the drugs, nor quantity apart, for doing so on this occasion. To the contrary his long history of addiction, so carefully weighed by his Honour, argued strongly for the defence he advanced."" 
        
       
      
    46 There was, according to the applicant, nothing beyond the quantity of the drugs which led his Honour to reject the applicant's case (para 26). 
     
      
    47 The Crown responded to these submissions by drawing attention to the findings his Honour made before his conclusions, which are set out above. Contrary to the applicant's submissions, his Honour did, according to the Crown, reject significant aspects of the applicant's evidence. He said this: (ROS p7/8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""27. The offender claims that, as he was a regular and heavy user of MDMA, using up to a gram of it almost every day of the week, something that he had done for two or three years, he purchased the MDMA which he imported into Australia for his own use, purchasing sufficient to last him about a year. Also, he claims that he purchased the cocaine which he imported into Australia for his own personal use so that he could have a 'little bit of fun'."" 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour continued, making the following adverse finding against the applicant: (ROS p8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. I do not doubt that MDMA and cocaine are widely available, easily obtainable and cheaper to purchase in London than in Sydney. I do not doubt that the offender was a regular and heavy user of MDMA at the time of his arrest and that he had been such a user of it for two or three years before his arrest,  
        although I doubt that he used as much of it each day and that he used it almost every day as he claimed 
        . ..."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    49 The remarks continued, again commenting adversely upon the applicant's evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""28. ... Also, I do not doubt that he had used other prohibited drugs, including cocaine, before his arrest.  
        However, I do not accept that he did not know the approximate purity of street quality MDMA and the approximate purity of MDMA that he had purchased. 
         A regular and heavy user of a prohibited drug, whether it was heroin, cocaine, amphetamine or MDMA, would want to know the approximate purity of the drug being purchased so as to ensure value for money, and being used so as not to endanger his or her own life."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    50 It was within that context that his Honour stated that he was not satisfied that the applicant had imported the MDMA for his own personal use (ROS para 29), referring to the value of the drugs, both wholesale and street value. It was, he said, quite obvious that he had ""imported it into Australia to deal with it commercially"" (ROS para 29). 
     
      
    51 In my view, his Honour provided adequate reasons. He made it clear that he did not accept the applicant's evidence concerning the level of his use, one gram per day. The suggestion of a year's supply of drugs for personal use, imported at some personal risk, both physically and legally, stretches one's credulity. That evidence having been rejected, so that the supply was plainly for more than a year (and perhaps considerably more), it is hardly surprising that his Honour was not persuaded on the civil onus. 
     
      
    52 I would reject grounds (a), (b) and (c). 
     
      
       
      (d) In the alternative, that the sentence imposed was too severe. 
       
      
    53 This aspect was not the subject of written or oral submissions. The sentence was plainly within range. It was not too severe. I would likewise reject ground (d). 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    54 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. But the appeal dismissed.

BLACKBURN J. 

I had come to the  conclusion  that  this  appeal  should 

be dismissed, and  I had  prepared reasons for  judgment 

supporting  that  conclusion.  Having  afterwards had  the great 
advantage of an  opportunity  to  read  the  reasons for judgment 
prepared  by  my  brethren, I am  now  convinced, by  their 
searching  examination of  the  legislative  history,  that s . 5 5 6  
of the  Crimes Act  1900  (N.S.W.)  in  its  application  to  the 
Australian  Capital  Territory,  must be  construed  as  barring 
both civil and  criminal  proceedings;  that  White v.  Ellis 
( 1 9 8 3 )   47  A.C.T.R.7? 
that  the  appeal  must  be  allowed. 

must in  this  respect  be  overruled:  and 

This result is capable  of  causing  grave  injustice. 

Section 556  was  originally  intended, as my  brethren 
demonstrate, to prevent  multiplicity  of  actions  and  to  put a 
person  aggrieved  by an  act  which is both a  crime and a  tort  to 
his  election  to  institute  either  civil or criminal 

proceedings.  In  modern  times,  when  criminal  prosecutions are 

almost  invariably  initiated  by  the police,  when  the  law of 
tort is so much  more  highly  developed,  and  awards of damages 
are so much  larger,  the  section is capable  of  providing  a 
totally  unmeritorious  defence  to  an  action  for  damages. 

I agree  with  the  order  proposed  by  my  brethren.

In  the introductlon  to  the  work  clted  Greaves  drew 

atteqtion  to the  difflculties  attendant  upon  the  consoildation 
of statutes.  At p.xv  the  learned author said: 

""Another difficulty  arlsing  from  such  a course 15, 
that a clause  In  one  statute  may.  elther  by  itself, 
o r   construed  wlth the  rest  of t:?at  statute,  bear 
one  meanlnq.  but  when  transferred  Into  a 
Consolldatlon  Act,  and  separated  from 
1 c s   former 
associated  clauses.  m d   placed  amongst  other 
clauses  taken  from  other A c t s ,   l t  may be open to an 
entirely different construccicn:  and. in  thls  point 
one  of  the  qreatest  difficultlos  in consolldatioc 
consists; f ~ r  it  is  hardly  possible. even wlth the 
greatest care, to  foresee the 2ffect of placl.nq  in 
the  same Act,  especially  ~f it  be  a l m q   Act. 
And  m such 
clauses  taken  from  different  Accs.

foreseen, a~? alberatlon  of some  kind  sust  be  made. 
and  then  the  question  lmmedxately  arises  what  that 
alteratior.  ought  to  be,  and. in  this  the  greatest 
lawyers  may  differ, and  lf  m y  alteration  ln che 
law  be  made,  It  at  once  ceases  to  be  mere 
consolldatlon.  If  the  effect  is not  fDreseen.  then 
the lzw  will be thrown  lnto  confuslon."" 

If tine  effect  is 

dilemma  arises.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal lawâ€”Fraudâ€”Employee
filing false expense accounts as a means of increasing salaryâ€”Belief by accused
of employer's sanctionâ€”Whether intention to defraudâ€”Conviction quashed by Court
of Appealâ€”Whether quashing based on grounds of lawâ€”Whether quashing should be
upheldâ€”Criminal CodeÂ  1953â€”54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The respondent, the Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police, was
convicted at trial under s. 323(1)Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ  on a number of
counts charging him with having defrauded the public and the Government of the Province
 of Quebec of various sums of money. In 1952, he applied for an increase in his
salary. He was told by the head of his Department, the Solicitor General who
had referred his application to the Attorney General, that he was entitled to
an increase but due to the fact that a general survey of salaries in the Civil
Service was in progress, an increase could not be granted at the time. However,
he was told that he could draw a certain amount per month by way of expenses. A
large number of the expense accounts which were thereafter submitted by the
respondent were admittedly fictitious. This practice continued until 1960 when
his salary was increased. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts
ceased. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave
to appeal to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting):
The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of guilty restored.

[Page 175]

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the
uncontradicted evidence of the respondent himself, no other conclusion could be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, no other conclusion in
law could be reached save that he had defrauded the provincial government and
the public of the amounts which he thus obtained. With the exception of certain
counts in the indictment on which he was acquitted, there was no evidence on
the basis of which any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to
the respondent having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of
expenses which were fictitious and false. On an appeal from a conviction, if an
Appellate Court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is
not capable of creating any doubt, there is an error in law. It is no answer to
a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the
accused nor is the proposition that the province and the public were not
defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely
because the respondent's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought
it ought to be. To hold so was an error in law.

The guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depended
upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Courts below. This
raised questions of law in respect of which there was error. There was,
therefore, a right of appeal to this Court by the Crown.

Per Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting:
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed
fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense. It
follows that this Court had no power to review the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, since it is a well-settled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal
to this Court is limited to questions of law in the strict sense and that when
a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and
the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be
dismissed.

LE JUGE EN CHEF
(dissident):â€”Mon collÃ¨gue M. le Juge
Cartwright a rÃ©sumÃ© tous les faits essentiels Ã  la dÃ©termination de cette
cause, et il est donc inutile de les relater de nouveau. ll me suffira de dire
simplement que le juge de premiÃ¨re instance a acquittÃ© le prÃ©venu sous sept des
chefs d'accusation, qu'il l'a trouvÃ© coupable de tentative 

[Page 176]

de fraude sous trois chefs
distincts et a rendu un jugement de culpabilitÃ© sous tous les autres chefs.

La Cour du banc de la reine[2]
a cassÃ© le jugement rendu en premiÃ¨re instance, et permission spÃ©ciale a Ã©tÃ©
accordÃ©e au prÃ©venu de loger un appel devant cette Cour. (Code Criminel
598).

Cet appel cependant ne peut
porter que sur des questions de droit et nullement sur des questions de faits
ou des questions mixtes de droit et de faits.

Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il
me semble clair que la majoritÃ© de la Cour du banc de la reine, en dÃ©livrant
son jugement, a fait reposer en partie ses conclusions sur des questions de
faits, ou au moins sur des questions mixtes de droit et de faits qu'il nous est
interdit de reviser.

II faut, pour que la Cour SuprÃªme
du Canada ait juridiction, qu'il s'agisse d'une question de droit stricte dans
le vrai sens du mot. (508 C. Cr) (Rex. v. DÃ©cary[3]
).

Comme je crois que cet appel
comporte l'apprÃ©ciation de questions de faits, je suis d'opinion que cette Cour
n'a pas juridiction et que l'appel doit Ãªtre rejetÃ©.

The judgment of Cartwright and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):â€”This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the
District of Quebec1, dated July 26, 1963, allowing an appeal from the judgment
of His Honour Judge Dumontier dated September 28,1962, and directing that the
respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted.

On July 16, 1962, the
respondent, who had elected to be tried by a Judge without a jury, was
arraigned before His Honour Judge Dumontier on an indictment containing three
counts to which he pleaded ""not guilty"". We are concerned only with
count 3, which reads as follows:

QuÃ©bec, pour une somme d'au moins $8,999.10, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21.

[Page 177]

On July 17, 1962, the learned
trial judge ordered that this count be divided into 235 separate counts which
are set out in his judgment and in that of the Court of Queen's Bench. The
first of these reads as follows:â€”

3.-1. Le ou vers le 31 mai
1952, dans les citÃ© et district de QuÃ©bec, Ã©tant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs donc Commandant Ã  QuÃ©bec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dÃ©penses faux et fictifs pour lui-mÃªme, fraudÃ© le public en gÃ©nÃ©ral
et le Gouvernement de la Province de QuÃ©bec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The remaining 234 counts were
similarly worded except as to date and amount; the last charged an offence
committed on May 9, 1960.

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

While the printed record consists
of many volumes the relevant facts may be stated comparatively briefly.

In May, 1940, the respondent was
appointed Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police at a yearly salary of $4,000; in
August, 1941, this was increased to $4,500. In 1952 the respondent applied for
an increase in salary to the then Solicitor-General who referred the matter to
Mr. Duplessis who was then both Attorney-General and Prime Minister. Mr.
Duplessis told the Solicitor-General that an enquiry was going on before the
Civil Service Commission into the question of raising the salaries of the
Quebec Liquor Police and of civil servants in general and that if he granted
the respondent an increase he would immediately be pressed with requests by
others and then said words to the following effect:

Vous direz Ã  Lemire, ou vous
lui ferez dire que je l'autorise Ã  retirer cinquante piastres ($50.00) par
mois, Ã  titre de frais de reprÃ©sentation, ou de dÃ©penses,

The evidence of the Solicitor-General
continued:

De retour Ã  mon
bureau, j'ai dit Ã  Lemire â€” je ne sais pas si c'est Ã  lui personnellement ou si
c'est peut-Ãªtre Ã  CÃ´tÃ©, ma mÃ©moire n'est pas assez fidÃ¨le pour vous l'affirmer
que je l'ai dit Ã  lui â€” mais je sais qu'il l'a su, ou Ã  son adjoint, qui Ã©tait
Wellie CÃ´tÃ©, que le Procureur GÃ©nÃ©ral l'autorisait Ã  retirer mensuellement un
montant de cinquante dollars ($50.00) Ã  titre de frais de reprÃ©sentation, et
que dans le fond, Ã©tait pour tenir lieu d'une augmentation de salaire qui
s'Ã©levait Ã  six cents piastres ($600.00) par annÃ©e.

[Page 178]

The substance of this
conversation was communicated to the respondent by Wellie CÃ´tÃ© who had been
appointed associate director of the Quebec Liquor Police in January, 1951, and
of whom Tremblay C.J. says that unofficially he was the respondent's superior.
At this time CÃ´tÃ© handed the respondent a cheque of the QuÃ©bec Liquor Police
for $50. Some days later CÃ´tÃ© presented a document to the respondent for
signature. This was a printed form partially filled in in typewriting. The
following phrase was type-written:

DÃ©placement et frais de
sÃ©jour pour surveillance du travail.

Several blank spaces in the form
intended for the insertion of details were left blank. Above the signature of
the respondent appeared the following certificate:

Je certifie que les dÃ©penses
plus haut mentionnÃ©es ont Ã©tÃ© nÃ©cessairement encourues dans l'intÃ©rÃªt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordÃ©es.

The form did not specify any
""cause"". It was dated ""May"".

Thereafter from time to time CÃ´tÃ©
presented the respondent with a cheque and a similar form which the respondent
signed and in this manner the respondent received amounts totalling $50 a month
until the form dated February 17, 1953, was returned to the respondent marked
""annulÃ©"".

On receipt of this the respondent
went to the office of the Provincial Auditor and had an interview with an
employee. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence of their conversation was
inadmissible and we do not know what was said between them. The question
whether this evidence was rightly excluded is not before us, and consequently,
I express no opinion on it.

Following this interview the
forms signed by the respondent were filled up in detail, specifying the place
visited, the hotel at which respondent stayed, the amount paid for railway fare
and the price paid for meals. There appears to be no doubt that a large number
of these forms were entirely false in fact and described trips which the respondent
had not taken.

In the year 1954 CÃ´tÃ© advised the
respondent that he was authorized to draw $100 a month in this manner instead
of $50. This practice continued until May, 1960, when the respondent's annual
salary was increased to 

[Page 179]

$7,400 and he ceased to withdraw
any further sums in augmentation of his salary.

The learned trial judge finds as
a fact that the authorization to withdraw the sum of $50 was given orally by
the Attorney-General and communicated to the respondent but concluded as a
matter of law that it was ""nulle, de nullitÃ© absolue"". He goes on to
hold that the respondent could not have had an honest belief that he was
entitled to obtain the moneys which he did obtain by rendering expense accounts
which were false in fact. He finds as a fact that the great majority of the
expense accounts signed by the respondent were false and fictitious but does
not specify which particular ones were false and finds that about twice a year
the respondent went on trips of inspection in connection with which he would
have been entitled to receive his expenses. He does not make an express finding
as to whether CÃ´tÃ© told the respondent he was authorized to draw $100 monthly
instead of $50. At the time of the trial both the Attorney-General and CÃ´tÃ© had
died.

The respondent appealed against
his convictions. On October 1, 1962, the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side,
granted him leave to appeal on questions of fact.

The appeal was heard by a Court
composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ. The appeal was
allowed and it was directed that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts
on which he had been convicted. All the members of the Court reached the same
result but each gave separate reasons.

On October 2, 1963, leave was
granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court on the following three questions:

1. La Cour d'Appel du
district de QuÃ©bec a-t-elle errÃ© en droit dans l'interprÃ©tation et
l'application de l'article 592(1)Â  (a) de Code CriminelÂ  du Canada?

2. La Cour d'Appel du
district de QuÃ©bec a-t-elle errÃ© si elle a ignorÃ© les lois gouvernant la
manipulation et la dÃ©pense des deniers publics et a-t-elle mal interprÃ©tÃ© les
lois applicables dans l'espÃ©ce?

3. La Cour d'Appel du
district de QuÃ©bec a-t-elle errÃ© en droit dans l'interprÃ©tation et
l'application de l'article 323(1)Â  du Code CriminelÂ ?

This leave was granted pursuant
to s. 598(1)Â (b) of the Criminal CodeÂ . Authority is not required for the
wellsettled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal is limited to
questions of law in the strict sense.

[Page 180]

It is clear from the judgment of
this Court in The Queen v. Warner[4],
that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which
one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this
Court must be dismissed.

I am satisfied that in the case
at bar the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of
mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense.

Tremblay C.J. holds that as to
the first 17 counts, in regard to which the certificates signed by the
respondent named no ""cause"" and gave no details, the money was paid
over to the respondent before he signed the certificates which constituted
rather receipts for money paid than demands for payment and that no one was in
fact deceived or induced to pay over the money by any representation on the
part of the respondent. This is a finding of fact or, at the highest from the
point of view of the appellant, a mixed finding of fact and law.

As to the remainder of the counts
the learned Chief Justice expresses himself as follows:

Quant aux autres
chefs, entre en jeu une considÃ©ration diffÃ©rente qui me paraÃ®t pÃ©remptoire.

La preuve rÃ©vÃ©le hors de
tout douteâ€”l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admisque certains frais inscrits sur les
formules n'ont pas Ã©tÃ© encourus par l'appelant. Mais il rÃ©sulte aussi de la
preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvÃ© hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces
frais n'a Ã©tÃ© encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du
doigt ceux qui ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©ellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas Ã©tÃ©. La seule preuve apportÃ©e par la Couronne sur
ce point rÃ©vÃ¨le que l'appelant Ã©tait Ã  son bureau de QuÃ©bec la plupart du
temps. Les tÃ©moins admettent cependant
qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par annÃ©e. L'appelant a retrouvÃ© deux formules
qui contenaient des frais rÃ©ellement encourus. Il a jurÃ© qu'il y en avait
sÃ»rement d'autres mais que sa mÃ©moire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer
aprÃ¨s tant d'annÃ©es. Il faut dire que l'appelant Ã©tait Ã¢gÃ© de 74 ans lors de
son tÃ©moignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne,
me paraÃ®t nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs,
le premier juge a acquittÃ© l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu
prÃ©ciser. De son propre chef, il a retranchÃ© du montant allÃ©guÃ© dans d'autres
chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit
de recouvrer.

De ce qui prÃ©cÃ¨de il
rÃ©sulte que, mÃªme si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalitÃ© entre le
paiement et les reprÃ©sentations, je ne puis dire quant Ã  quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les reprÃ©sentations sont fausses et quant Ã  quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numÃ©ro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numÃ©ro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a Ã©tÃ© acquittÃ©. Le substitut du procureur gÃ©nÃ©ral a d'ailleurs
franchement admis

[Page 181]

lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation prÃ©cis sont bien fondÃ©s. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun n'a Ã©tÃ© prouvÃ© hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit Ãªtre acquittÃ© sur tous les chefs.

This appears to me to be a
finding of fact. The learned Chief Justice has considered the evidence and
reached the conclusion that it does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt,
the guilt of the accused upon any of the counts on which he was convicted. I
find it impossible to say that the question whether he was right in reaching
this conclusion is one of law in the strict sense.

TASCHEREAU J. delivered the
following reasons:

Les faits rÃ©vÃ©lÃ©s par la
preuve et qu'ont exposÃ©s M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Casey dÃ©montrent que
de graves irrÃ©gularitÃ©s ont Ã©tÃ© commises par l'appelant. Mais la question vitale est celle de savoir si
Lemire, un homme maintenant Ã¢gÃ© de 74 ans qui a Ã©tÃ© directeur de la police des
liqueurs Ã  QuÃ©bec, pendant vingt ans, avait l'intention coupable de frauder le
public et le gouvernement de la Province de QuÃ©bec, lorsqu'il a posÃ© les actes
qu'on lui reproche.

L'Ã©tude du dossier m'a convaincu
qu'il fallait rÃ©pondre nÃ©gativement Ã¢ cette question. Aussi, commes mes
collÃ¨gues, j'accueillerais l'appel et libÃ©rerais l'accusÃ©:

The first paragraph accurately
states a question which the Court of Appeal was called upon to answer. It
involves an inquiry into the respondent's state of mind. The state of a man's
mind is, in the often quoted words of Bowen L.J., as much a fact as the state
of his digestion; vide Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5].
The decision of Taschereau J. to allow the appeal appears to me to be based on
a finding of fact certainly it cannot be said that the sole ground on which he
has proceeded is a question of law in the strict sense.

From this it appears that a
majority of the Court of Appeal, in quashing the convictions, have proceeded on
grounds which this Court has no power to review and it follows that the appeal
must be dismissed.

Having reached this conclusion it
becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether it could be said that the
judgment of Casey J. was based only on grounds which this Court has
jurisdiction to review and I express no opinion on that question.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 182]

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:â€”The material facts
involved in this case are not in dispute. At all relevant times the respondent
Lemire (hereinafter referred to as ""Lemire"") was the Chief of the
Quebec Liquor Police. There was an Associate Chief, one Wellie CÃ´tÃ©, who was in
fact, though not in name, the real head of the force. In the year 1952 Lemire
applied to the Solicitor-General of Quebec for an increase in his salary, which was then $4,500
per annum. The Solicitor-General referred the application to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Duplessis, who was then also the Prime Minister of the Province. The
latter, while he approved of an increase for Lemire, was not prepared to grant
it, because it might provoke other similar requests, and the whole salary
structure of the Quebec civil service was then under review. He told the
Solicitor-General to tell Lemire that he would authorize Lemire to draw $50 per
month by way of expenses. This information was communicated to Lemire by CÃ´tÃ©.

I agree with Casey J. in the
Court[6] below
when he says that the instructions given by the Attorney-General necessarily
implied the making of fictitious expense accounts.

Lemire commenced, in May, 1952,
to put in expense accounts, initially for $50 per month and then, commencing on
July 15, 1952, for $25 for each half month, represented to be for ""Frais
de dÃ©placement et de sÃ©jour pour surveillance du travail."" Each of these
expense accounts contained the following certificate, signed by Lemire:

Je certifie que les dÃ©penses
plus haut mentionnÃ©es ont Ã©tÃ© nÃ©cessairement encourues dans l'intÃ©rÃªt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordÃ©es.

The expense account dated
February 14, 1953, was returned to Lemire, by the Provincial Auditor's
Department, marked ""annulÃ©"". Lemire then saw an employee of that
Department who is unkown. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence by Lemire
as to his interview with the employee was not admissible. In any event Lemire
filed an expense account, dated February
 15, 1953, purporting to contain the
details of his expenditures, totalling $25.

[Page 183]

Thereafter, until the beginning
of the year 1954, he proceeded to file two, and occasionally three, expense
accounts each month, appearing to contain items of expenditure which he had
incurred, each one of which contained the certificate previously quoted. Each
of these was for an odd amount and not for an even $25.

Early in the year 1954 Lemire
says that he was advised by CÃ´tÃ© that his monthly expense accounts could be
increased to $100. At the time of the trial CÃ´tÃ© was dead. Evidence was given
by the former Solicitor-General that he was unaware of any authority having
been given for any increase beyond the initial, fixed amount of $50 per month.
Commencing in 1954, Lemire's total expense accounts rendered each month became
larger. In most instances two accounts were filed in each month, although on
some occasions there would be three or more.

This practice continued until the
year 1960, when Lemire received a salary increase to $7,400 per annum.
Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased.

The procedure respecting expense
accounts was that two forms were required to be filed, one white and one
yellow, the latter being retained in the office of the Liquor Police. The white
one, signed by the person seeking payment of expenses, had to be verified by
the accountant of the Liquor Police, was then forwarded to the Department of
the Attorney-General and, from there, was transmitted to the office of the
Provincial Auditor for approval. Section 17 of the Provincial Audit Act,
R.S.Q. 1941, c.72, required that such accounts be examined and that it be
ascertained that the payments charged be supported by voucher.

It is clear, from this brief
outline of the facts, the material portions of which are admitted by Lemire,
that, over a period of years, he submitted expense accounts which he knew to be
false and obtained payment out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec of those amounts which were claimed in the expense accounts.

Lemire was charged under s.
323(1)Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ , which provides:

323. (1) Every one who, by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false
pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person,
whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security, is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

[Page 184]

The learned trial judge required
that the original count, which had charged Lemire with defrauding the public
and, in particular, the Government of the Province of Quebec, of the sum of $8,999.10,
be divided into 235 separate counts, each dealing with one expense account.

Count No. 1 will serve as an
example of the form in which these various charges were made:

1. le ou vers le 31
mai 1952, dans les citÃ© et district de QuÃ©bec, Ã©tant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs dont Commandant Ã  QuÃ©bec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dÃ©penses faux et fictifs pour lui-mÃªme, fraudÃ© le public en gÃ©nÃ©ral
et le Gouvernement de la Province de QuÃ©bec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

Lemire's appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[7], was
allowed by unanimous decision. The Court was composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and
Casey and Taschereau JJ., each of whom gave separate reasons.

As to the first 17 counts, which
dealt with those expense accounts rendered by Lemire prior to and including
that dated February 14, 1953, which was annulled by the Auditor-General, Tremblay
C.J. says:

Pour ces 17 premiers
cas, l'appelant tÃ©moigne, et il n'est pas contredit, que les chÃ¨ques lui
Ã©taient remis soit avant, soit au moment mÃªme oÃ¹ on lui demandait de signer les
formules. Ce ne sont donc pas les
reprÃ©sentations contenues dans ces formules qui ont amenÃ© le consentement au
paiement. C'Ã©tait un reÃ§u que l'appelant signait plutÃ´t qu'une demande de
paiement.

De plus, il ne me paraÃ®t pas
raisonnable de croire que quelqu'un ait pu Ãªtre trompÃ© par ces formules. Bien
que la partie imprimÃ©e de la formule l'exigeÃ¢t, aucune date de dÃ©part ou de
retour, aucun dÃ©tail des supposÃ©s frais ne sont donnÃ©s. Le certificat qui rÃ©fÃ¨re Ã  Â«l'intÃ©rÃªt de cette causeÂ»
n'a pu tromper personne puisqu'aucune cause n'est mentionnÃ©e. ll manque donc un
Ã©lÃ©ment de l'offense: le lien de causalitÃ© entre le consentement au paiement et
les reprÃ©sentations de l'appelant. ll est possible que ceux qui ont payÃ©
n'avaient pas le pouvoir de disposer ainsi des fonds publics, mais il y aurait
alors recours civil en rÃ©pÃ©tition de l'indÃ» mais non crime de fraude.

L'on dira peut-Ãªtre
que ce raisonnement est exact quant au Â«gouvernement de la province de QuÃ©becÂ»
mais non quant Â«au public en gÃ©nÃ©ralÂ» que l'appelant est aussi accusÃ© d'avoir Â«fraudÃ©Â».
Si l'on considÃ¨re le public indÃ©pendamment de son mandataire, le gouvernement
de la province, il faut dÃ©cider que, si l'appelant est coupable d'un crime, ce
n'est pas de

[Page 185]

celui de fraude,
parce que le public n'a jamais consenti au paiement et que le consentement de
la personne frustrÃ©e est un Ã©lÃ©ment essentiel du crime de fraude.

With respect, I think it is an
error in law to construe the forms signed by Lemire as being receipts, rather
than demands for payment, merely because, according to his evidence, after the
first occasion, the signed form was handed him by CÃ´tÃ© at the same time that he
received the cheque from CÃ´tÃ©. The cheques which were delivered by CÃ´tÃ© were
drawn on the account of the Liquor Police. They were signed by CÃ´tÃ©, as
director, and also by the accountant of the Liquor Police. They represented
payments from public funds, which, admittedly, could only be validly justified
by proper vouchers, and these CÃ´tÃ© had to obtain. Expense moneys were payable
only on the basis of a certified statement of actual expense. Each such
statement had to be verified and thereafter to be approved by the Auditor-General.
It is obvious that Lemire could not have continued to receive the cheques
without having provided the false statements which were the basis for their
issuance. The scheme must be examined as a whole and, when that is done, there
is no question but that false expense accounts were submitted by Lemire as a
basis for his receipt of public funds. This constitutes the ""lien de
causalite"" between the vouchers and the payments which the learned Chief
Justice felt was lacking in this case.

It is suggested that no one was
deceived by these expense accounts because they did not contain a detailed list
of the expenditures as contemplated by the form. To say this is to say either that
the persons required by law to check the forms were themselves also parties to
the fraud, or that they failed to perform their duties properly. However, even
if this be so, and whichever is the case, this does not provide Lemire with an
answer in law to the charges under s. 323(1)Â . Whether or not they deceived the
people who were supposed to check and verify them, the point is that, without
filing of the expense accounts, the payments to Lemire from public funds could
not have been obtained or continued. Section 323(1)Â , in addition to mentioning
deceit and falsehood, also refers to ""other fraudulent means"".
Whether or not they deceived the people who saw them, they were the necessary
means used to obtain the payments and without them the payments would not have

[Page 186]

been made. They were fraudulent.
In my opinion the ground taken in the second paragraph above quoted is wrong in
law.

In the third paragraph of the
passage above quoted it is said that the public was not defrauded because the
public never consented to the payment. There is here an error in law. The
public, through its elected representatives, had consented to the expenditure
of public funds only on the basis of compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures. In my opinion any one who, by fraudulently purporting to fulfill
those requirements, obtained payment of public moneys, to which he was not
lawfully entitled, would thereby have defrauded the public within the meaning
of s. 323(1)Â .

I find it impossible to see how,
on the uncontradicted evidence of Lemire himself, any other conclusion can be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, I do not see how any
other conclusion in law can be reached save that he had defrauded the
Provincial Government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained.

In this connection the reasoning
of Cartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of this Court in Cox
and Paton v. The Queen[8],
is relevant. In that case the accused were charged with having conspired to
commit an indictable offence; i.e., by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited. It was contended in argument that
there was no evidence that any official of that company had been deceived,
particularly as the president of the company and its controlling shareholder
was fully aware of all that was being done by the accused. Dealing with this
argument, Cartwright J., at p. 512, said:

In the course of argument on
this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was
no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they
intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false
representation made to the company or of any official of the company have been
deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished.
Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the
meaning of s. 597(1)Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ ,, I would reject this
argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to
the $200,000 which is the first i",19/11/1964 0:00,CA Supreme Court

1SIMPSON J: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: GJ, the appellant, seeks leave to appeal out of time pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed upon him by Sweeney DCJ on 15 March 2012. 

3The appellant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the following offences:

(i) Sequence 1: 

An offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which occurred between 16 September 2000 and 16 September 2002, with a victim who was under the age of sixteen years, namely aged seven or eight years. This offence carried a maximum penalty at the time of the commission of the offence of 20 years imprisonment. 

(ii) Sequence 9:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2006, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged twelve years. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to 
s 61M(1) is 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

(iii) Sequence 16:

An offence of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2006 and 16 September 2007 when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged thirteen years. 

(iv) Sequence 7: 

An offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being an offence that occurred between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was under sixteen years, namely aged fourteen years. 

(v) Sequence 11: 

An offence of using a child under fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period 16 September 2005 and 16 September 2007, when the victim was twelve and thirteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. 



(vi) Sequence 8:

An offence of using a child above fourteen years of age for pornographic purposes, contrary to s 91G(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, during the period between 16 September 2007 and 16 September 2008, when the victim was fourteen years of age. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

4All of the above offences were committed by the appellant on his youngest daughter. 

5When adhering to his pleas of guilty in the District Court, the appellant asked her Honour to take into account on sentence four offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act that had been placed on a Form 1. 

6The appellant was sentenced as follows (ROS 10):

The earliest date the appellant is eligible to be released on parole is 19 January 2018. 

8The Judge had reduced the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 


FACTS 

9An agreed statement of facts was tendered which the Judge summarised in her sentencing remarks. The appellant was born in 1960 and married his wife in 1988, having three children. The youngest child was the victim of the appellant's offending. The offences took place between 2000, when she was 7 or 8 years old and the middle of 2008, when she was 14 years old. 

10Shortly stated the facts are: 

Sequence 1: This offence occurred when the victim was 7 or 8 years old. The appellant went into her bedroom (which she shared with her older sister). The victim was asleep but awoke when he pulled her legs to the side of the bed. He pulled down her underpants, knelt on the floor and held her legs in the air. He licked her vagina for about two minutes. 

Sequence 11: On three separate occasions in March, May and July 2006 when the victim was 12 years old, the appellant photographed her naked body and vagina with his mobile telephone. He told her how to position her body before he took the photographs. On two other occasions, in October 2006 and June 2007, when she was 13, he engaged in the same conduct. All of this conduct was dealt with as one charge. 

Sequence 9: On one of the occasions in sequence 11 in 2006, the appellant took the victim's hand and moved it along the shaft of his penis.

Sequence 16: On one of the occasions in sequence 11, in 2006 or 2007, when she was 13, the appellant touched her vagina with one of his hands.

Sequence 8: On two occasions in January 2008 and August 2008, when the victim was 14, he used his mobile phone camera to photograph her body and vagina. This conduct was dealt with as one count. 

Sequence 7: When the victim was 14 and having a shower, the appellant got into the shower with her, kissed her on the lips and put his tongue in her mouth (Form 1 offence - sequence 4). He told her to put her hand on his penis and guided her hand along the shaft for about 10 minutes (Form 1 offence sequence 5). He then positioned her against the wall and stood behind her, rubbing his penis against her vagina and bottom, moving backwards and forwards for three to four minutes (sequence 7). 

The other Form 1 offences involved the appellant rubbing his penis against the victim's vagina (sequence 14) and moving her hand along the shaft (sequence 17). 







The appellant's subjective circumstances

11At the time he committed the offences, the appellant was aged 40 - 48 years. He was 52 years old when sentenced. 

12The appellant had worked all of his adult life as a coach driver and had no prior convictions. 

13In a report dated 21 November 2011, Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, observed that the appellant did not have a psychiatric disorder, nor did he have any substance abuse issues. The Judge noted that Dr Nielssen reported that the appellant acknowledged his offences and expressed remorse for his behaviour. Her Honour stated (ROS 7):

""Although [the appellant] did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, I accept Dr Nielssen's professional opinion and accept [the appellant] is remorseful, as also indicated by his early pleas of guilty.""

14The Judge related Dr Nielssen's dismissal of paedophilia and characterisation of the appellant's offences as ""intra-familial, opportunistic offences that do not appear to be the result of a primary disorder of deviant sexual interest"". Her Honour noted Dr Nielssen's opinion: ""that this category of offence is typically associated with a lower risk of re-offending"" (ROS 9). Her Honour observed (ROS 9): 

""Dr Nielssen's opinion bodes well for [the appellant's] prospects of rehabilitation.""

The adjournment application 

15The application for leave to appeal was filed on 11 September 2014 some 2 years 6 months after the appellant was sentenced. An affidavit of Malcolm Douglas Carr, the appellant's solicitor, was filed in Court, which sought to explain the delay in instituting the appeal. As Mr Carr was not instructed prior to 4 December 2013, there was no material before the Court as to what may have occurred prior to that date after the appellant was sentenced. Mr R Sweet, the appellant's counsel recognised the difficulties that created for the appellant and sought an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. 

16The application for the adjournment was refused, as the Court considered that the proposed appeal had no merit and there were no prospects of success, even if the appellant was able to provide in the future a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay in commencing the appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the rejection of the appellant's application did not cause any injustice to him.

Grounds of Appeal 

17The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely: 

1. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to apply the totality principles, having added up the sentences for each of the offences. 

2. Sweeney DCJ erred in law, causing her sentencing discretion to miscarry, in that she failed to give any or any adequate reasons as to why she had ordered some of the sentences to be served cumulatively upon other sentences imposed.

18The two grounds of appeal may be conveniently dealt with together. 

19The appellant submitted that, having reached the conclusion after sentencing the offender on six separate offences, that the total effective sentence was 9 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years, her Honour erred ""in that she failed to record that she had considered and/or clearly failed to comply [with] the totality principle"" (AWS 2.1.1). The appellant referred to the totality principle having two limbs, the first being that the total effective sentence must ""bear a proper relationship"" to the ""overall criminality"" involved in all the offences and the second limb being that the ""total effective sentence imposed on an offender"" should not constitute a ""crushing sentence"" (AWS 2.1.3).

20A further contention was that, having reached the conclusion that it was appropriate for there to be ""partial accumulation"" of the sentences, her Honour fell into error in giving absolutely no reasons at all as to why it was that she imposed sentences that were ""partly concurrent and partly accumulated"", other than stating she had done so to ""achieve an appropriate total sentence"" (AWS 3.1.1).

21The Crown referred to the Judge's findings in her remarks on sentence and submitted that it was obvious that she had considered the principle of totality. The Crown pointed out that an accumulation simpliciter of the individual non-parole periods would have resulted in an effective non-parole period of 12 years. The Crown contended that the Judge clearly took into account totality in reaching an effective non-parole period of half that length, and only two-thirds of the effective head sentence, having appropriately found special circumstances in order to adjust the ratio of individual non-parole periods to head sentences (CWS 35).

Consideration 

22As the appellant was being sentenced for more than one offence, the Judge was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57. The total sentence imposed must properly reflect the totality of the criminality: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219. Subject to the application of established principle, questions of accumulation or concurrence are discretionary: Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; [2007] NSWCCA1; R v XX (2009) 195 A Crim R 38; [2009] NSWCCA 115. 

23It is evident from her Honour's sentencing remarks that she carefully considered each of the offences and separately assessed their objective seriousness. After recounting the appellant's subjective case and determining that the sentences would be reduced by 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty, her Honour said (ROS 10): 

""To achieve an appropriate total sentence, the sentences will be partly concurrent and partially accumulated. I found special circumstances in the partial accumulation of the sentences to vary some of the non-parole periods"" (italics added) 


24In the exercise of her discretion, the Judge commenced the sentences for offence sequences 8, 9, 11 and 16 on 20 January 2012. The sentence for offence sequence 7, was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 11, as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2013. The sentence for offence sequence 1 (including Form 1 offences) was partially accumulated on the non-parole period of offence sequence 7 as the sentence commenced on 20 January 2014. 

25It is plain that the Judge undertook the task of separately determining the starting points and lengths of each of the sentences in order to give effect to the principle of totality. Her Honour was not obliged to otherwise explain the structure of the sentence. In my opinion, the total effective sentence was appropriate for all of the appellant's offending and was not a crushing sentence. Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal out of time be refused. 

26McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

Soon after it was boarded, an officer (under s 4 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) (â€˜the Actâ€™)) gave notice of seizure of the Mitra, along with its nets, traps, other equipment and catch, under s 106C of the Act. That notice began a process which would result in the Mitra and its equipment and catch being the forfeited to the Commonwealth of Australia, if it had been used to commit certain offences under the Act. The two relevant offences are using a foreign boat for commercial fishing in the AFZ, or having a foreign boat equipped for fishing possession in the AFZ. However, it is a defence to each of these offences if the Mitra was in the AFZ as a result of a mistaken but reasonable belief of fact.  2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The owners of the Mitra say that the â€˜mistake of factâ€™ defence is available to them because the Master of the Mitra plotted his position using the Geographical Positioning System (â€˜GPSâ€™) onboard the Mitra and he believed he was 11 nautical miles outside the AFZ. The owners say that in all the circumstances this was a reasonable mistake and they have therefore commenced these civil proceedings seeking a declaration that the Mitra is not forfeited and seeking to have the Mitra returned to them. 3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (â€˜AFMAâ€™) and the Commonwealth of Australia are the respondents in these proceedings. I will refer to them jointly in these reasons as AFMA. Â AFMA says that the Master did not have a reasonable mistaken belief as claimed, relying upon a number of inconsistencies between his evidence (and that of his crew) and other evidence they have called.Â  In particular, they rely upon evidence which they claim shows that the Mitra was used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. Because of these matters, AFMA says that the Master should not be believed when he claims to have made a mistake as to his location.Â  Further, AFMA says that if the Master did make any such mistake, it was not a reasonable mistake in all the circumstances so that the owners cannot avail themselves of the defence.  4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Before determining the central issues in these proceedings, it is necessary to determine certain threshold evidentiary issues raised by the parties in their written submissions.Â  The two evidentiary issues are who bears the onus of proof and what standard of proof applies to the central issues. The two central issues then to be determined are:  (a)Â Â Â  Was the Mitra being used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ? (b)Â Â  Did the Master have a mistaken but reasonable belief about his location? 5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  However, before turning to deal with these four issues, it is necessary to set out some of the factual background to explain how the Mitra came to be where it was at the time it was boarded. Further, while most of the facts relevant to these proceedings have been agreed between the parties and do not need to be set out here, it is necessary to set out certain of the agreed facts to clarify which elements of the offences under the Act are not in issue; and also to make it clear that the complicated processes at work under the Act are not in dispute. Finally, the relevant legislative provisions are set out below to make clear the various offences that may have applied to the Mitra in the circumstances and how the defence of a mistaken but reasonable belief may apply to those offences. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On 29 March 2008, the Mitra was fishing under licence in Indonesian waters quite some distance north of the AFZ.Â  The Master received a radio message from another fishing vessel in the area telling him that Indonesian Navy ships were conducting exercises in the vicinity and, because the Indonesian Navy had a reputation for â€œcausing troubleâ€ for foreign fishing vessels in Indonesian waters, the Master decided to leave that area to avoid contact with them.Â  As a result, the crew of the Mitra ceased fishing, pulled in the nets and set sail on a course south towards Australian waters. 7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Mitra sailed south for about seven hours, at the relatively high speed of about eight to ten knots.Â  As he came closer to Australian waters, the Master says that he saw a â€˜red lineâ€™ on the GPS monitor which he assumed was the line in the GPS he had previously been told was the border of the AFZ. At about 11.30pm on 29 March 2008, the Master stopped the Mitra at a point which he thought, by reference to the GPS, was about 11 nautical miles north of the â€˜red lineâ€™ and therefore 11 nautical miles north of the AFZ border.Â  At some point before the Master stopped the Mitra, the Chief Engineer of the Mitra, a Mr Xieu You Chai (â€˜the Chief Engineerâ€™) told the Master that he had detected some problem with the main engine and wanted an opportunity to work on it.Â  After the Master stopped the Mitra, he told the Chief Engineer that he could start work on the engine.Â   8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The owners say this work continued for about five hours and that the Mitra drifted on the tide during this period. AFMA says that this is the period when the Mitra was used for commercial fishing. If the owners are correct, then the Masterâ€™s actions are unimpeachable; but if AFMA is correct, then the Mitra was being used to commit an offence of the very kind that the enforcement provisions of the Act are intended to combat.  9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At about 4.30am on 30 March 2008, while the engineers were working on the engine, the Master says he detected a boat approaching.Â  He says he initially thought it was an Indonesian Navy boat but that it turned out to be an Australian Navy Patrol Boat, â€˜the HMAS Maryboroughâ€™.Â  At 5.12am a boarding party from the HMAS Maryborough boarded the Mitra.Â  It appears to be common ground that at the time of boarding, the engineers were working on the main engine of the Mitra and the engine was not operating. AFMA relies upon the observations of the boarding party to establish that the Mitra was used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. 10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As noted above, the agreed facts make it clear that certain elements of the offences under the Act are not in issue and that the complicated processes at work under the Act are not in dispute. The pertinent agreed facts are as follows (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â  The applicants are the owners of the Mitra which is a foreign boat within the meaning s 106A of the Act. (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â  Tay Shan Jang was the master of the Mitra and theMitra was in his possession and under his control at all relevant times. (c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Mitra is (and was) a fishing trawler which is (and was) equipped with nets, traps or other equipment for fishing within the meaning of s 101 (1) of the Act. (d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the time it was boarded, the Mitra was at a place about 7 nautical miles inside the AFZ. (e)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  None of the exceptions provided in ss 100(1)(a) and (b) and ss 101(1)(a) to (e) applied to the Mitra.  (f)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Chief Petty Officer Boatswain (â€˜CPOBâ€™) Ray Manley, an officer under s 4 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) (â€˜the Actâ€™), gave a notice of seizure of the Mitra along with its nets, traps, other equipment and catch (â€˜the seized thingsâ€™) under s 106C of the Act. (g)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On 7 April 2008, the owners, through their solicitors, made a claim for the return of the Mitra and the seized things. That claim was treated by Australian Fisheries Management Authority (""AFMA"") as a claim made under s 106E of the Act. (h)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On 10 April 2008, AFMA gave a notice under s 106F of the Act, that the Mitra and the seized things would be condemned as forfeited under s 106G(2) of the Act unless the owners instituted recovery proceedings within two months. (h)Â Â Â Â Â Â  The owners commenced these proceedings on 14 April 2008.Â  In their application, the owners seek declarations and orders, among others, as follows: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A declaration that the seized things are not forfeited pursuant to section 106G of the Act. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  An order that the seized things be delivered up and returned to the Applicants. THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS 11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  AFMA was established pursuant to s 5 of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 (Cth) (â€˜the Fisheries Administration Actâ€™).Â  Its functions and objectives are set out in ss 7 and 6 respectively of that Act, along with s 3 of the Act.Â  In essence, these provisions require AFMA to implement efficient and cost-effective fisheries management on behalf of the Commonwealth and to ensure that the exploitation of its fisheries resources is conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development as defined in s 6A of the Fisheries Administration Act.Â  This kind of legislation has been described as being â€œof great importance economically and politically to the preservation of Australian fishing interestsâ€ see Chiou Yaou Fa v Morris (1987) 87 FLR 36 (â€˜Morrisâ€™). 12Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The term â€˜AFZâ€™ is defined in s 4 of the Act to mean the Australian fishing zone which is, in turn, defined in that section as follows: â€˜(a)Â Â Â Â Â  the waters adjacent to Australia within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of Australia; and (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the waters adjacent to each external territory within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of the external Territory; Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  but does not include: (c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  coastal water of, or water tithing the limits of, a State or internal Territory; or (d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  waters that are excepted waters.â€™ â€˜Exclusive economic zoneâ€™ is defined in s 4 of the Act to mean â€œthe exclusive economic zone, within the meaning of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 (Cth)â€.Â   That definition, in turn, adopts the meaning in Articles 55 and 57 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provide as follows: The exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in this Part, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention. The exclusive economic zone shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. 13Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Part 6 of the Act (ss 83-108B) deals with surveillance and enforcement. Â The relevant enforcement provisions for foreign boats such as the Mitra are set out in Division 5 of Part 6 (ss 99-105) of the Act.Â  The purpose of these types of enforcement provisions is â€œto protect Australian fishing grounds from exploitation by the use of foreign boats without the permission of an Australian official: see Cheatley v The Queen (1972) 127 CLR 291 at 295-296 per Barwick CJ.Â  Leaving aside the question of the mistake of fact defence, the parties agree that the Mitra was involved in offences against ss 100 and 101 of the Act. The relevant parts of those sections are as follows: 100Â  Using foreign boat for fishing in AFZâ€”strict liability offence (1)Â Â Â Â Â Â  A person must not, at a place in the AFZ, use a foreign boat for commercial fishing unless: [it is agreed that these exceptions do not apply â€“ see above] â€¦ (2)Â Â Â Â Â Â  A person who contravenes subsectionÂ (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units. (2A)Â Â Â Â  Strict liability applies to subsectionÂ (2).  [emphasis added] 101Â  Having foreign boat equipped for fishingâ€”strict liability offence (1)Â Â Â Â Â Â  A person must not, at a place in the AFZ, have in his or her possession or in his or her charge a foreign boat equipped for fishing unless: [again, it is agreed that these exceptions do not apply â€“ see above] â€¦  (2)Â Â Â Â Â Â  A person who contravenes subsectionÂ (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units. (2A)Â Â Â Â  Strict liability applies to subsectionÂ (2). [emphasis added] 14Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As is apparent from ss 100(2A) and 101(2A) (above), offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2) of the Act are defined as strict liability offences.Â  S 3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) gives effect to the Criminal Code (the â€˜Criminal Codeâ€™) as a law of the Commonwealth and, under s 2.2(2) of the Criminal Code, that Code applies to the offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2) of the Act.Â  S 6.1 of the Criminal Code relevantly provides as follows: 6.1Â  Strict liability Â  (1)Â Â Â Â Â Â  If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of strict liability: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the defence of mistake of fact under sectionÂ 9.2 is available. â€¦  (3)Â Â Â Â Â Â  The existence of strict liability does not make any other defence unavailable.  [emphasis added] 15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  S 9.2 of the Criminal Code relevantly provides as follows: 9.2Â  Mistake of fact (strict liability) Â  (1)Â Â Â Â Â Â  A person is not criminally responsible for an offence that has a physical element for which there is no fault element if: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the physical element, the person considered whether or not facts existed, and is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted an offence.  [emphasis added] 16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is clear from these provisions that a mistake of fact as defined in s 9.2 can be relied upon to avoid criminal responsibility for a strict liability offence. Further, s 6.1 makes it clear that where an offence is described as an offence of strict liability (as here), the offence does not involve any fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence.Â  Given the size of the AFZ and the significant resources required to police it, it is not difficult to see why the legislature has decided to expressly exclude the need to prove a fault element in the prosecution of the offences under ss 100(2) and 101(2).Â  S 4.1 of the Criminal Code describes the â€˜physical elementsâ€™, as follows: A physical element of an offence may be: (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  conduct; or (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  a result of conduct; or (c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs. 17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because of these clear provisions of the Criminal Code (and others â€“ see [20] below), it is not necessary to delve into the sorts of questions that have arisen in numerous authorities over the years, as to whether fault is an element of the relevant offences under the Act, whether mistake of fact is a defence to those offences and who will bear the onus of proof on these issues: see, for example, MorrisÂ  at 52 to 61 (dealing with a prosecution under a predecessor to the Act), and He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 (â€˜He Kaw Tehâ€™) (dealing with a prosecution under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) prior to the introduction of the Criminal Code). The meaning of â€˜reasonable beliefâ€™ as used in s 9.2 of the Criminal Code will be considered later in these reasons. WHO BEARS THE ONUS OF PROOF AND WHAT STANDARD OF PROOF APPLIES? 18Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The two threshold evidentiary issues I need to consider before considering the two central issues are: who bears the onus of proof and what standard of proof applies to the two central issues? 19Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On these evidentiary issues, AFMA submitted that: Â a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The owners have an evidentiary onus to raise the defence of Â Â Â Â  mistake of fact under section 9.2 of the Criminal Code; b)Â Â Â Â Â  The owners discharged that onus by adducing evidence from the Master to the effect that he was operating under a mistake of fact at the time; c)Â Â Â Â Â Â  AFMA therefore bears the onus of negativing that defence; and d)Â Â Â Â Â  AFMA is required to discharge that onus on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. 20Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In my view, AFMA has correctly identified who bears the onus of proof and, with one qualification, it has correctly identified the standard of proof that applies in determining the two central issues.Â  Neither counsel referred me to s 13 of the Criminal Code which deals with the onus of proof in the prosecution of offences under the Criminal Code. Since AFMA has conceded that the owners have discharged their evidential onus (see 19(b) above), it follows from s 13 that AFMA bears the onus of disproving or negativing the defence of mistake of fact: see ss 13.3(2) and 13.1(2) respectively of the Criminal Code. 21Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As to the question of the applicable standard of proof, AFMA relied upon the decision of French J. in Olbers v Commonwealth of Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 229; 136 FCR 67 (â€˜Olbersâ€™).Â  In Olbers, French J had to consider the same sections of the Act as have arisen for consideration in this case.Â  In determining what approach he should take to the question of whether or not offences had been committed under ss 100 and 101 of the Act, his Honour observed (at [65]) that: â€œalthough these are civil proceedings a finding that offences had been committed is a serious matter and it is necessary that an appropriate degree of satisfaction be reached, albeit it is not necessary that I be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that offences have been committedâ€. 22Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  His Honourâ€™s observations are based upon Dixon Jâ€™s often quoted observations in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 and the long line of High Court authorities since then, including Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 67 ALJR 170.Â  In that case, in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Brennan, Deane, and Gaudron JJ their Honours observed that while â€œthe strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to proveâ€, such statements â€œshould not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proofâ€ (at 170 â€“ 171). Their Honours had earlier emphasised that the standard of proof in civil proceedings is the â€˜balance of probabilitiesâ€™, even where the matter sought to be proved involves criminal conduct.  23Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Based on these authorities and given the concession made by AFMA, I will therefore proceed on the basis that AFMA bears the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that: (a)Â Â Â  the Mitra was being used by a person or persons for commercial fishing in the AFZ in contravention of s 100(2); and (b)Â Â  the Mitra was not within the AFZ at the time as a result of a mistake of fact on the part of the Master under s 9.2 of the Criminal Code.  While the civil standard applies to the proof of these two issues, since they involve serious matters, namely contraventions of the Act, clear or cogent evidence is required to prove the alleged conduct. WAS THE MITRA BEING USED FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING AT THE TIME? Introduction 24Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The first central issue for determination is whether AFMA has established that the Mitra was being used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. On this issue AFMA has relied upon observations made by Royal Australian Navy personnel shortly after they boarded the Mitra, in submitting that the inference should be drawn that the Mitra had been used for commercial fishing â€œsome 3 â€“ 4 hoursâ€ before it was boarded. These observations concerned the condition of the equipment on the Mitra, the presence of fish on the deck of the Mitra and the condition of some fish in the freezer of the Mitra. AFMA has also relied upon a number of inconsistencies which it says exist in the evidence of the Master, the Chief Engineer and the crew of the Mitra on this and other issues. 25Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  While much of the evidence at hearing was directed to this issue, I do not consider it necessary to do more than set out a summary of the main parts.Â  This is because there is other independent, objective evidence which I consider establishes that it is unlikely that the Mitra could have been used for commercial fishing while it was in the AFZ. I will briefly refer to, and make some observations on, the evidence of the owners and of AFMA before turning to consider that independent and objective evidence. The crew and the Master deny the Mitra was used for commercial fishing 26Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is no direct evidence that the Mitra was being used for commercial fishing while it was within the AFZ. In their interviews with AFMA personnel, conducted some days after they arrived in Darwin Harbour on 2 April 2008, and while they were in detention, the crew members of the Mitra variously stated: that the fishing nets had last been hauled onto the boat about 10 hours before the boat was boarded (according to Mr Song Shi Young); that the last episode of fishing had occurred on the afternoon of 29 March 2008 (according to Mr Xiao Hai Zheng), or that the last fishing occurred on the morning of 29 March 2008 when it was â€œnearly noonâ€ (according to Mr Zheng Shi Xeng).Â   27Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There are some obvious inconsistencies in these various versions.Â  However, they are all consistent in claiming that the Mitra was last used for fishing before it began its run south. Moreover, they are all consistent in claiming that no fishing occurred in the 3 to 4 hour period before the Mitra was boarded, as is asserted by AFMA. 28Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Master said in evidence that he was certain that there had been no fishing in Australian waters at any time and that there had been no fishing for at least 24 hours before entering Australian waters. On its face, this evidence is inconsistent with the statements of the crew members who put this intervening period at between 10 and 18 hours. However, it is broadly consistent with the statements that the Master made in his interview with CPOB Manley soon after the Mitra was boarded and it becomes more consistent with the statements of the crew members when the explanations he gave in cross-examination are taken into account. The interview with CPOB Manley was conducted through an interpreter, using numbered interpreter cards. The relevant details appear in CPOB Manleyâ€™s affidavit as follows: I then proceeded to ask the Master a number of further questions using the Indonesian and Taiwanese cards.Â  Among the questions asked, and the Masterâ€™s answers were: In response to being shown Indonesian card 21 and Taiwanese card 16 which both ask â€œHow many days have you been in the area?â€, the Master responded one day. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 18 which asks â€œHow many days have you fished here?â€, the Master indicated that he had not been fishing in this area. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 24 which asks â€œHow long has your fishing equipment been in the water?â€, the Master responded not in this area. Â  In response to being shown Taiwanese card 27 which asks â€œHave you caught any fish in the area?â€, the Master answered that he had not caught any fish in this area. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 31 which states â€œYou are currently in Australian waterâ€, the Master disputed his position and claimed that the position on the vesselâ€™s GPS indicated that he was in Indonesian waters and not in the Australian area. Â  In response to being shown Taiwanese card 33 which states â€œIt is illegal to fish here without a licenseâ€, the Master replied that he was not fishing here, but in Indonesian waters. In response to being shown Taiwanese card 34 which asks â€œWhy are you in this area?â€, the Master responded that the engine was broken. In response to being shown Indonesian card 32 which asks â€œWhich countryâ€™s waters are you currently in?â€, the Master responded that he was in Indonesian waters, and pointed at the vesselâ€™s GPS indicating from the vesselâ€™s position up as Indonesian waters. â€¦ After the Master stated during the questioning that Mitra 2139â€™s engine had broken, I asked him [h]ow long to repair the engine and he replied one day.Â  I then repeated the question and asked â€œone day to repair engine?â€, to which the Master nodded his head and replied â€œyesâ€. [emphasis added] Â  29Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In his cross-examination by Mr Macliver (Counsel for AFMA), the Master explained what he meant by his statements (above) that he had been in the area â€œone dayâ€ and the engine was under repair â€œone dayâ€ as set out in the following excerpt of transcript: QUESTION: Mr Macliver: Could the witness be shown Mr Manleyâ€™s affidavit?Â  Mr Jang, can you look at the card marked number 34.Â  Itâ€™s page 24 to Mr Manleyâ€™s affidavit, annexure RCM3.Â  That asks does your engine work. ANSWER: The interpreter: I told them we still repairing. QUESTION: Mr Macliver: Yes, you told them the engine was broken? ANSWER: The interpreter: Yes, he told them they were still repairing. QUESTION: Mr Macliver: And did you also say that the engine had broken down and had been repaired for about a day? ANSWER: The interpreter: Yes. I tell them that we â€“ the engine is broken and we have been repaired a day.Â  A Chinese day is not been 24 hours.Â  Chinese day is today.Â  Chinese means â€“ â€œone dayâ€ it means â€œtodayâ€. MR MACLIVER: Thank you, Mr Jang. THE INTERPRETER: Yes, â€œa dayâ€ means â€œtodayâ€. 30Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Given that he had stopped at about midnight on 29 March 2008 and the Chief Engineer commenced work on the engine shortly thereafter, the Masterâ€™s explanation that the engine had broken down and was being repaired â€œtodayâ€ and not â€œone dayâ€ is plausible.Â  AFMA submitted that this explanation should not be accepted, but did not call any evidence to challenge the claim the Master made (that â€˜one dayâ€™ means â€˜todayâ€™ in Chinese). I therefore reject AFMAâ€™s submission. 31Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This exchange between the Master and Mr Macliver exhibits communications problems similar to others that arose during the hearing of this matter. It seems likely that such problems would have been present throughout the process, dating back to the time the Mitra was boarded. In my view these problems stem from language difficulties and cultural differences.Â  Another example of the language difficulties arose in relation to the expression â€œbroken downâ€ and whether it meant â€œhaving problems with the engineâ€ (burning a lot of oil for example), or whether it meant the engine was not operating at all.Â  Another example of the cultural differences arose over the length of the Masterâ€™s experience as the Master of the Mitra.Â  He claimed he was appointed in 2004.Â  He was challenged in cross-examination with a document obtained from the Taiwanese authorities that seemed to suggest that he was appointed in 1991.Â  His explanation in cross-examination was to the effect that 2004 in the Western calendar was the equivalent of 1991 in the Taiwanese calendar.Â  While AFMA maintained this attack on the Masterâ€™s veracity during its initial closing submissions, it conceded in a subsequent set of submissions, by agreement with the owners, that the",3/10/2008 0:00,Federal Court of Australia
2703196,R v Weismantel (No 4) [2015] NSWDC 389,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application for leave pursuant to s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The accused makes an application out of time for trial by Judge alone. Such an application must be made 28 days before the day fixed for the trial in this Court unless the Court otherwise grants leave. If that application be successful, there will follow an application under s 132(4) of the same Act for leave to have the matter tried by a Judge alone as the prosecutor does not consent to the making of an order for trial by Judge alone. It is convenient to deal with both applications at the one time.
	
	
	On 23 September 2014, the accused was committed for trial by the Downing Centre Local Court on a number of charges. Six of those charges arose out of events which occurred on 23 September 2013. The current matter arose out of an event which occurred on 31 December 2013. I shall refer to the current matter as the second trial. The first trial is clearly a reference to the matters alleged against the accused as occurring on 23 September 2013. As far as the first trial is concerned the accused was to be tried with a co-offender, Amanda Faith Ridden.
	
	
	The accused was arraigned in respect of the first trial and in respect of the second trial on 24 October 2014. Two indictments were presented, one applicable to the first trial and one applicable to the second trial. The indictment concerning the first trial contained one count against Amanda Faith Ridden, and it contained six counts against both Ridden and the current accused. The first count was that on 23 September 2013 at Lane Cove the accused whilst in company took for the purposes of driving a motor vehicle, a Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, without consent of the owner, Phillip Brighton, whilst Phillip Brighton was in the vehicle. The second count was a count in the alternative to that count. The third and fourth counts allege armed robberies at the Roseville Cinema. The sixth count was of armed robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel on 23 September 2013. The final count was a count that whilst in company the accused did intentionally destroy the Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle registered number YTG582, the property of Phillip Brighton.
	
	
	After the arraignment the list judge, Acting Judge Delaney, fixed a six week trial commencing on 15 June 2015. There was a direction that the trial on the current charge, that is the second trial, follow immediately after the conclusion of the first trial. The matter came before the Chief Judge, Price J, on 16 June 2015. I am told and have been told earlier that on that day Ridden pleaded guilty to a number of charges after plea bargaining. The Chief Judge stood the current accusedâ€™s trial over to 17 June and on 17 June the matter was stood over for trial on 18 June. The matter was supposed to come before me on that day but I was engaged in a civil hearing until 6pm that day. The matter was due to be before me on Friday 19 June but it was convenient for all concerned that the matter commence on Monday 22 June. On that day, the accused was arraigned on a fresh indictment containing six counts against the accused alone, in respect of the events of 23 September 2013. That day was spent on the hearing of an application for the adducing of coincidence evidence. I ruled that the coincidence evidence be admitted. The matter was then adjourned until 23 June 2015 when I was asked to grant the parties time. Eventually, at 2pm a fresh indictment was presented and the accused was arraigned on four counts and pleaded guilty to each of those four counts. There was one count of taking Mr Brightonâ€™s motor vehicle without his consent, he being in the car and three counts of armed robbery. I was asked to stand the back-up trial, namely, this second trial, until Wednesday 24 June at 10am. At the request of the parties I directed that the accused might be excused on Wednesday 24 June 2015. Mr Schaudin, who appears for the accused, told me that he wished to attend upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain certain instructions from him. Unfortunately, he could not do so because the accused was brought to court when it was unnecessary that that be done.
	
	
	On 24 June, I was told by the Crown that the present trial could not start until today and that it was then that I was told that Mr Schaudin was attending upon the accused at Long Bay Gaol to obtain instructions. I then stood the matter over for mention today. Mr Schaudin was able to obtain the instructions which he sought from the accused yesterday, Thursday 25 June, and hence the applications made to me today.
	
	
	The present indictment contains one count. That count is this:
	


â€œOn 31 December 2013 at Pennant Hills...while armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife did assault Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault he, the said Blake Weismantel, did inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.â€


	
	The facts relied upon by the Crown are these, gleaned from exhibit T5. There is situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills a Thai restaurant. That restaurant is owned by Sathaporn Wongsamak, who is also the chef. There are nine employees including Mr Wongsamakâ€™s wife, Laynookar Wongsamak, to whom I shall refer merely as Mrs Wongsamak. All nine members of the kitchen staff as well as Mr and Mrs Wongsamak were working on New Yearâ€™s Eve 2013. At around 10.30 pm, Mr Wongsamak was working in the kitchen and Mrs Wongsamak was working at the counter which is located to the right of the front entrance of the restaurant. Four customers were standing on the footpath outside the restaurant waiting for one of their friends who was still inside the restaurant using the bathroom. The four customers on the footpath had finished their meal and were waiting to be joined by their female friend. At about the same time, Mrs Wongsamak and her sister were sitting behind the front counter where the cash register was located.
	
	
	The accused walked in through the front door of the restaurant and approached the counter. He was holding a knife, 28 centimetres long, in his right hand. He was wearing a black coloured long sleeve woollen jacket with the hood covering his face. He was holding the hood down with his left hand. He was also wearing red, white and blue striped shorts. The accused reached over the counter and pointed the knife towards Mrs Wongsamak waving it around. The blade came very close to Mrs Wongsamak, almost touching her chest and abdomen. At that time the accused said nothing. He walked around the counter near to Mrs Wongsamak and her sister and started hitting the cash register with the knife yelling out, â€œEmpty, empty!â€ As the accused was yelling he was looking at Mrs Wongsamak. She was shocked, scared and shaking. Mrs Wongsamak called out to her husband for aid. Mr Wongsamak and one of their daughters, and their nephew, and two staff members, ran from the kitchen of the restaurant.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak yelled out at the accused. He grabbed a wooden chair and held it towards the accused shouting, â€œGet outâ€. The accused turned around and walked towards Mr Wongsamak. He pointed the knife towards Mr Wongsamak again making stabbing motions. Mr Wongsamak used the chair to block the accusedâ€™s knife. The accused let go of his hood and grabbed another chair, pushing the chair and Mr Wongsamak back about a metre and a half, causing Mr Wongsamak to trip over and fall. He fell onto his left hand side, but in so doing twisted his right leg. Another staff member, Mr Borom, came out of the kitchen, picked up another chair and threw it at the accused. He then picked up a further chair and threw that at the accused. The accused then walked out of the restaurant, turning left, crossed the road, and started walking up Hillcrest Road towards Yarrara Road. A witness used his mobile telephone to take a photograph of the accused as he left. The accusedâ€™s red, white and blue striped board shorts can be seen in the photograph.
	
	
	Meanwhile Mr Wongsamak tried to stand up but could not do so because of pain in his right ankle. He remained laying on the floor. One of the customers who was outside the restaurant witnessed the event and called the emergency number. Police and ambulance officers arrived a short time later. A description of the accused was then broadcast. Unsuccessful attempts were made by a police dog to follow the accused. At approximately 10.35pm the accused was seen walking in a southerly direction along Pennant Hills Road, approximately 600 metres from the restaurant. The accused was asked to sit down, which he did. He was searched and police located a mobile phone, a black handled kitchen knife which was removed from the rear waistband of his shorts. The accused was trying to swing his arms around, and was behaving in what is alleged to have been an aggressive manner. At one point he became unconscious. The police called an ambulance. Whilst waiting for the ambulance to arrive the accused regained consciousness and over the next 40 minutes made rude comments to several police officers. On several occasions he moved around and two officers were required to restrain him.
	
	
	According to the police facts the accused remained moderately aggressive and was threatening, and did not respond to attempts to calm him down. At times he was incoherent. While Constable Brylynsky tried to hold the accused, the accused attempted to grab his hands on several occasions. The accused was alleged to yell words to the effect of, â€œFuck you, you fucking dog, you like it when I grab you.â€ The accused was then placed under arrest. He was taken to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance under police escort. The accused also behaved aggressively to hospital staff. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where he was intubated and sedated to manage his aggressive behaviour. On New Yearâ€™s Day 2014 he was weaned from the sedation and he became more alert. He remained calm and was reviewed by the psychiatric team at the hospital, and he was re commenced on anti-psychotic medication. On 2 January 2014 he was medically stable, alert, oriented and calm. He was discharged by the hospital into police custody. He was taken to Hornsby police station and charged. He was offered an opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview but declined to do so.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak was conveyed to Hornsby Hospital by ambulance. He presented to the Emergency Department at 11.53pm. The history given by Mr Wongsamak to hospital staff was that whilst he was at work a man with a knife attempted to rob the business, and in the process of that occurring he twisted his ankle in the course of trying to evade the assault. On examination, the right ankle was swollen over the lateral malleolus and the patient was unable to the weight bear. X-rays demonstrated a spiral fracture of the fibula in the ankle. Mr Wongsamak was admitted to the hospital under the care of Dr Ben Gooden, an orthopaedic surgeon.
	
	
	There is before me, as well as a report from the doctor in the Emergency Department, a report from Dr Ben Gooden. He points out that the X-ray not only showed an oblique fracture of the distal fibula, but that oblique fracture extended to the level of the syndesmosis. The X-ray was said to show widening of the ankle mortise in keeping with instability of the ankle joint. Dr Goodenâ€™s report continues thus:
	


â€œMr Wongsamak was taken to theatre on 1 January 2014 and underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the fibula [sic] fracture with a seven hole one third tubular plate and screws. The syndesmosis was found to be unstable on stressing and he therefore had two diastasis screws inserted through the plate. He was kept non-weight bearing for a period of eight weeks post-operatively, and was then mobilised, weight bearing, following this. On 7 March 2014 he returned to the operating theatre to have the diastasis screws removed. This is a standard part of treating this type of fracture.

With regard to the questions that were asked of me from Senior Constable Steven Ireland on 7 July, this particular fracture is a reasonably common one. It does require significant force to lead to fracture of the fibula in association with disruption to the syndesmosis. The metal plate and screws were required to reduce the fracture into an anatomical position and this is standard treatment for this kind of displaced fracture. The patient underwent two procedures, the first being on 1 January 2014 to have the plate and screws inserted, and the second being on 7 March 2014 to have the two diastasis screws removed. It is usual to leave the remaining fibula metalwork in place, this is not routinely removed unless there are overt problems with the metalwork.

The prognosis for this gentleman is good. Most people who suffer these fractures will return to full activities as tolerated over the ensuing three-six months post-operatively. There is an incidence of patients who suffer from ongoing pain and swelling in their ankle after this and there is an incidence of the development of post traumatic arthritis in the long term. Post-operatively, patients require three-six months of physiotherapy to help regain their range of motion and full function of their ankle.â€


	
	A statement taken from Mr Wongsamak on 14 September 2015 tells me that he still experiences constant numbness on the lateral malleolus. Prior to the fracture of his right ankle Mr Wongsamak exercised â€œquite a bitâ€, including walking on treadmills two or three times weekly. Since the fracture of his ankle Mr Wongsamak is unable to do that and develops pain and soreness in the ankle very quickly when he tries to walk for any long period of time. These ongoing symptoms have affected Mr Wongsamakâ€™s ability to work. He is required, as a chef, to stand and he develops soreness and pain when he stands for long periods of time, which he never experienced before he fractured his ankle. He also notices symptoms when at rest. His ankle might start to ache when he is sitting down, which had never happened before the fracture of his ankle.
	
	
	That there might be post-traumatic arthritis indicates that there was damage to an intra-articular surface and as the ankle is a weight bearing joint it would appear that the onset of post-traumatic arthritis at some time in the future is inevitable. In any event, it appears that Mr Wongsamak has not made a complete recovery from this injury and it appears to me to be unlikely that he will do so, bearing in mind that symptoms have now persisted for some 17 months at least.
	
	
	The accused, by his counsel, tells me that there is no issue as to the identification of the accused at the crime scene. No alibi is raised. No positive defence is raised. In essence, the accused is putting the Crown to proof. That is understandable since the offence alleged against the accused carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. The accused wants a trial by judge alone. Although the original proceedings were listed for trial for six weeks, the first trial shortened after a week and two days. The Crown was unable to immediately start the second trial which is due to start next Monday.
	
	
	The personal circumstances of the accused must be carefully considered. There is before me a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, who examined the accused, in connection with other proceedings, on 1 December 2012. At that time the accused was 19 years old. He is now 24 years old. He is of Aboriginal descent who was exposed to domestic violence in his early childhood. His father was an alcoholic and his mother was addicted to heroin. His parents were separated when he was about eight years old. He remained in the care of his mother. He came to the attention of the Department of Community Services, as it was then called, about the age of seven. He was deemed to be at risk of physical harm, including sexual harm, because he was not adequately supervised by his parents. It was noted at that time that the accused was behaviourally disturbed. He commenced abusing alcohol at the age of 12 because he mixed with â€œthe wrong crowdâ€. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in early childhood but was never treated with stimulant medication for that condition. In his childhood he suffered from mood swings and periods of anger. He also gave a history of depression and of psychotic symptoms that included hearing voices. When received into the Juvenile Justice System he was assessed as being psychotic. He was treated for both with antipsychotic medication and antidepressant medication. He was considered a risk to himself. He has been experiencing for some considerable time now hallucinations, auditory as well as visual. He also suffers from paranoia and as at 1 February 2012 had been having paranoid delusions for three years. He started abusing the sedative drug Valium at the age of 14 years and cannabis at the same time. He soonstarted using amphetamines and crystal methylamphetamine, or â€œiceâ€. By the age of 15 or 16 he was injecting heroin once or twice every fortnight. He also used Ecstasy at times, LSD and â€œMagic Mushroomsâ€.
	
	
	He was diagnosed by Dr Furst as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and substance abuse. Dr Furst also found evidence of personality dysfunction. Dr Furst said this about schizophrenia:
	


â€œSchizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, nerve instability and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness. There is often a prodromal period in which individuals with the illness feel lethargic, depressed and unable to cope, resulting in disruption to family relationships and poor social functioning. Frequent symptoms include paranoid beliefs, self-referential thinking, grandiose delusions and thought disorder.

Schizophrenia is thought to be biologically driven because of abnormalities in dopamine transmission, differences seen in brain volume and genetic transmission. It usually runs a chronic course requiring hospitalisation during acute episodes and the need for longer-term treatment with antipsychotic medications (tablets or injections), as have been required for Mr Weismantel in the past.â€

As to the prognosis Dr Furst expressed the view that the accused was likely to continue to display psychotic symptoms of a residual type which was typical of the type of the illness from which he was suffering.


	
	An ambulance officer requested an assessment of the accused at the time that the accused was with the police immediately after his arrest on Pennant Hills Road. The ambulance officer who was authorised to exercise functions under the Mental Health Act 2007 informed an authorised medical officer of the Hornsby Hospital that the accused was mentally ill or mentally disturbed. He provided these details:
	


â€œPatient demonstrating psychotic behaviour. Patient unclear of situation. Patient making sexual advances to officers in response to assessment. Patient threatening violence towards officers and officersâ€™ families. Patient agitated and fighting restraint. Patient not responding to questions or communicating appropriately.â€

Hence the accused was conveyed to the Hornsby Hospital and admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007 prior to his being discharged from that institution and taken into police custody. It is clear that immediately after the offence now alleged the accused was suffering from psychotic symptoms. I have been told from the Bar table, without objection, that the accused remains on antipsychotic medication to the current time.


	
	If the matter be tried with a jury I am told that the Crown will need to call between 10 and 15 witnesses to give oral evidence, as well, no doubt, as Dr Gooden to give evidence to the jury about the extent of the injury sustained by Mr Wongsamak. I am told by Mr Schaudin from the Bar table, again without objection, that should the matter be tried by judge alone the trial can be conducted with most of the statements of witnesses, with suitable redaction, being tendered into evidence without any of those witnesses having to give sworn evidence from the witness box. In other words, there does not appear to be any issue of credit which might best be left to a jury. There is no factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards including any issue of reasonableness, any issue of negligence or any issue, for example, of indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. There is not, as here, any issue relating to intention that might best be determined by a jury as arose in R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 or any issue that raises any substantive issue of the credibility or reliability of any witness as arose in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661.
	
	
	However, there is the issue of the accusedâ€™s mental state and his ability to give attention to a lengthy trial. I sought some assurances from learned counsel for the accused and was given them. When I asked the learned Crown Prosecutor whether it was necessary for Mr Schaudin to call his solicitor to give oral evidence about those matters from the witness box, I was told that was not necessary.
	
	
	The early part of the first trial was taken up, as far as the accused was concerned, with concentrating on the issues raised in the first trial and giving attention to the six counts which he then faced. In essence, a count in the alternative was dropped by the Crown and the Crown did not proceed with the final count, the count of intentionally destroying Mr Brightonâ€™s Nissan Pulsar motor car by means of a fire. The accused was prepared to plead guilty to charges carrying 25 yearsâ€™ imprisonment, but was not prepared to plead guilty to a charge which carried a maximum term of 11 yearsâ€™ imprisonment. Mr Schaudin assures me that because of the accusedâ€™s mental condition, he concentrated only on the issues relating to the first trial and did not raise with the accused any issues relating to the second trial until, in essence, the first trial was disposed of. It was then that the accused gave his counsel instructions to apply for trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	I have now seen Mr Weismantel in the dock for the whole of Monday, 22 June, and the afternoon of 23 June. I have seen him again in the dock this morning. At about 11.30 he asked to be excused from being in the dock, he preferred to be downstairs in a cell. He could not be taken from the Courthouse prior to the usual closing hour of 4pm in any event. Today he appears not attired for a trial, but in prison greens and he looked somewhat dishevelled, although he had not looked dishevelled last Monday. From what I was told from the Bar table, he appeared to be somewhat fatalistic about what might happen to him and oblivious to how he ought to be dressed when appearing before the Court. I am confident that a lengthy trial involving the calling of 10 to 15 witnesses would be very taxing on Mr Weismantelâ€™s ability to concentrate, and I am concerned that he might not present towards a jury favourably after a number of days of hearing.
	
	
	One can understand the accused putting the Crown to proof of the matters contained in the second indictment because one might readily accept that, bearing in mind what was observed by police and ambulance officers immediately after the crime alleged in the current indictment, that he might not have any independent recollection of what he had done and therefore he puts the Crown to proof.
	
	
	When I enquired of the learned Crown prosecutor what would be achieved by a trial by jury, as distinct from a trial by Judge alone, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that the question of whether the harm inflicted upon the victim, Mr Wongsamak, was grievous bodily harm, distinct from actual bodily harm, was quintessentially a matter for a jury. I have only had in 11 years, one jury trial where such an issue was left to a jury as the sole issue in the case. There was a fracture of a bone, but no residual symptomatology. Quite frankly, I have been dealing with medico-legal issues as a Judge now for 21 years next month and am acutely aware of what might constitute grievous bodily harm as distinct from actual bodily harm and I have no hesitation in believing that a judge with some experience in the field can adequately determine that matter as well as any jury can or ought or would.
	
	
	The purpose of s 132A is to prevent the practice known as â€œforum shoppingâ€. Not only is it to prevent that practice, it is to prevent the appearance of that practice. When I asked the learned Crown prosecutor whether it would be appropriate, to avoid the appearance of forum shopping, if I made the decision that the matter be tried by Judge alone, that it be heard by another Judge, the learned Crown prosecutor told me that if I made such an order there would be no application by the Crown that someone other than me should hear the Judge alone trial. In other words, the Crown accepts that this is not an actual exercise in â€œforum shoppingâ€. The only ruling I have made thus far was against the accused, when I determined that coincidence evidence should be admitted in the first trial.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the difficulties which I accept that the defence has had in obtaining instructions from the accused, I accept that it was imprudent to seek instructions from the accused to have a trial by judge alone in the second trial, whilst the issues concerning the first trial were still extant. In the circumstances, I believe that I should exercise my discretion under s 132A(1) and grant leave to the accused to make an application for an order under s 132 less than 28 days before the date fixed for hearing.
	
	
	That issue raised a nice point as to whether the time for making the application ran from the date when the first trial was set to commence or ran backwards from the date when the second trial should have commenced had the first trial proceeded. However, that I need not decide.
	
	
	The issue then becomes whether it be in the interests of justice that the current matter be heard by a Judge sitting alone. I have carefully read what fell from the McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 and also what fell from Hidden J, particularly at [118] and also the decision of Bellew J in R v King and the decision of Latham J in R v Dean. It is clear that the fact that an accused has made an application for trial by judge alone is relevant, but not determinative. It is also clear on the case law that there is no presumption that trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on the accused. The accused carries an evidentiary onus but the Court does not need to determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a â€œpresumptionâ€ of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and accordingly, depending on all the circumstances relating to a particular case, the Court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	There is no compelling reason in the current matter for trial by jury. There is a compelling reason, based on the accusedâ€™s mental health, that the trial be short. Accordingly, I believe it is in the interests of justice, not merely because of the interests of the accused personally, but because it is in the interest of our community that persons with a mental illness have a form of trial that meets the requirements of their medical condition, that meets the requirements of their ability to concentrate, and for a person such as the present accused, who may not recollect why or in what circumstances or how the offence was committed, that there be a reasoned explanation of why he might be guilty of the criminal offence, or, indeed, why he might not be guilty of the offence alleged against him. I have formed the view that it certainly is in the interests of justice that there be trial by Judge alone. I so order.

 Introduction 
The appellant was charged with the following offence: 
 
You, Ye Wei Gen, M/31 yrs NRIC: S2666144-G are charged that you on 16 April 1998, at or about 4pm, at Keppel Club, Bukit Chermin, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of Tan Ann Nie, F/21 yrs, by intruding into her privacy, to wit, by peeping in the cubicle when she was bathing, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted of the offence and fined $2,000 in default four weeks` imprisonment. The appellant has since paid the fine and has appealed against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted of an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code which reads: 
 
Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with a fine, or with both.
 
 
 
In making out its case against the appellant, the prosecution relied primarily on the evidence of the victim.
The victim testified that on the afternoon of 16 April 1998, she had gone swimming at Keppel Club (`the club`) with her boyfriend. After their swim at around 4pm, they both headed to the male and female bathrooms to wash up. These were located in the swimming pool complex of the club.
After placing her belongings in the locker, the victim entered one of the shower cubicles and began showering. The shower cubicle had an opaque curtain for privacy which the victim drew across the entrance to the cubicle. She initially had her back to the curtain when she turned on the shower, but, upon turning around, she saw the appellant looking at her through a gap between the curtain and the wall of the cubicle. She was completely naked at the time. The victim, despite being shocked and traumatised, shouted at the appellant. However, he continued staring at her for a few more seconds before leaving the female bathroom.
The victim gave evidence that the bathroom was lit and the distance between her and the appellant was less than one metre. She emphasised that, after she shouted at him, he continued staring at her for a few more seconds. The victim identified the appellant as the offender in the court below and gave a description of the offender that largely matched that of the appellant. More specifically, the victim said that she remembered his eyes, that he was fair-skinned and had slightly protruding teeth. Additionally, the victim reiterated her conviction that the appellant was the offender who peeped at her as `the look of him left a deep impression on me`. On top of everything, the appellant and the offender were both wearing a white shirt at the material time. The victim disagreed with defence counsel that she could not positively identify the appellant as the offender because it was too dark in the female bathroom and she added that her head was not under the shower of water at that time.
After the incident, the victim put on her clothes and went out to call her boyfriend. While they were standing in the area outside the male and female bathrooms discussing the matter, the appellant, his colleague and his boss walked past. The victim pointed out the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend but did not confront the appellant then because she was afraid that the appellant might turn violent. The victim`s boyfriend checked with the appellant`s boss whether they were from the management of the club but got a negative response. The parties went their separate ways.
The couple then headed to the security counter by the poolside to report the incident. The management of the club called back the appellant, his boss and his colleague who by then were about to leave the club. The victim`s boyfriend confronted the appellant and accused him of being the peeping Tom which the appellant vehemently denied. The victim testified that she consistently identified the appellant as the offender when the parties met at the security counter. The management took down the appellant`s particulars and he left the club.
The evidence of the victim`s boyfriend was generally in line with the victim`s testimony. He added that, despite feeling shocked and angry, he had not confronted the appellant the first time that the couple encountered him as it would be more prudent to report the matter to management first. Furthermore, he did not have much of a chance to stop the appellant, even though he had directed his enquiry about whether the group was from the management of the club to all three of them. He also said that the victim had pointed out the appellant to him twice after the incident.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The defence was a straightforward denial that the appellant had been in the female bathroom at the material time and had thereby committed the offence. The appellant said that he had gone to the club at about 3pm with his boss, Mr Lum Chong Chuen (DW2), and a female colleague, Rahimah, to conduct an inspection relating to the mechanical and electrical services for a club project. Rahimah was supposed to check the female bathroom and he was supposed to check the male bathroom.
The appellant`s account of his movements at the material time was as follows. Some time past 3pm, he went into the male bathroom to check the water tank. He took about ten minutes to do so. He then went back to the lobby, which was near the swimming pool complex, to discuss the project with Rahimah. After that, he went back inside the male bathroom to carry out another check. This whole procedure took an additional 10 to 15 minutes and the appellant was alone throughout this time. After completing his work, the appellant went to the cafeteria. He saw Rahimah sitting in the lobby and decided to buy two cans of Coke. He offered one of them to her but she declined it. They talked about the project for a further ten minutes. DW2 then showed up and there was a further discussion between him and the appellant regarding the work to be done for another ten minutes.
On the way to the pump room, the three of them encountered the victim and her boyfriend. The appellant`s version of events from then on was the same as that of the victim and her boyfriend`s accounts. The appellant said that he consistently protested his innocence when finally confronted by the victim`s boyfriend at the security counter. He willingly gave his particulars and denied having ever entered the female bathroom. His evidence remained unchanged under cross-examination.
DW2 testified that he had arrived at the club with his two employees. Upon arrival he went to the management office to join in a separate inspection with the Fire Safety Bureau. After completing this task, he went to look for the appellant and Rahimah and found the appellant in the video games room. The two of them went to the cafeteria and waited for about 10 to 15 minutes for Rahimah. The rest of his testimony did not vary from that of the victim, her boyfriend and the appellant.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge found that the only issue in this case was whether the victim had misidentified the appellant as the peeping Tom. Applying the 
 Turnbull 
 guidelines, as synthesised into a three stage test in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
 , the district judge held that the victim`s identification of the appellant as the offender was reliable. She came to this conclusion for four reasons: 
(a) although the female toilet was not brightly lit, there was enough light to enable the victim to see the facial features of the offender; 
(b) the distance between the victim and the offender was very short, only about one metre apart; 
(c) the victim gave evidence that the offender stared at her; it was not a fleeting glance at her; 
(d) after she shouted at the offender he continued staring at her.
The district judge added that this was the first time the victim had encountered such an experience and she was thus unlikely to forget the offender`s face.
With regard to the victim`s failure to confront the appellant when he walked past the couple along with his colleagues, the district judge accepted her explanation that she was afraid that the appellant might turn violent. The district judge noted however that the victim pointed out the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend. She also accepted the boyfriend`s explanation for not accusing the appellant directly before he clarified whether the group was from the management of the club. Further, the district judge was of the opinion that the victim`s reasons for identifying the appellant as the peeping Tom while at the Security Counter were sound.
As the only issue here was that of identification, the district judge, applying the dicta in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 , said that the heart of the case centred on the victim`s testimony and not whether there was corroborative evidence.
Finally, the district judge noted that there was a discrepancy between the appellant`s and DW2`s evidence in relation to whether the appellant was alone or with Rahimah when DW2 met him. The appellant said that he was in the lobby with Rahimah whereas DW2 said that the appellant was alone in the Video Games Room at the material time. The district judge was of the opinion that this was a material discrepancy and concluded that the appellant must have misrepresented the truth about the fact that he was with Rahimah in the lobby at the time the offence took place. She therefore found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant contended that the district judge had erred in law in finding that the victim`s identification evidence was of good quality within the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 and 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
. Furthermore, as the evidence against the appellant rested essentially on the testimony of the victim, he submitted that independent corroborative evidence regarding the offence should have been required. Finally, the appellant asked this court to overturn the district judge`s finding of fact. He contended that the appeal should be allowed as the lighting in the Female bathroom was not sufficiently bright, the victim did not accuse the appellant directly the first time she saw him after the incident, the so-called material discrepancy between the evidence of the appellant and DW2 in fact corroborated the appellant`s version of events, and the district judge had failed to properly consider the appellant`s evidence regarding his whereabouts at the time of the offence.
 The law on identification evidence 
 
 
 
The guidelines in 
 R v Turnbull 
 were recently reworked by the Court of Criminal Appeal for use in a non-jury system. In 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
, Karthigesu JA said the following at pp 475-476: 
 
In adapting the 
 Turnbull
 guidelines for our local system, we have reworked the 
 Turnbull
 guidelines into the following three step test. The first question which a judge should ask when encountering a criminal case where there is identification evidence, is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence which is alleged by the defence to be mistaken.
 
 
 
If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made? A non-exhaustive list of factors which could be considered include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness had seen the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. In considering the circumstances in which the identification was made, the judge should take note of any specific weaknesses in the identification evidence. If after evaluation of the identification evidence, the judge is satisfied that the quality of the identification is good, he may then go on to safely assess the value of the identification evidence.
 
 
 
Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should go on to ask the third question. Is there any other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification. If the judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification evidence, he should then be mindful that a conviction which relies on such poor identification would be unsafe. The supporting evidence need not be corroborative evidence of the kind required in 
R v Baskerville
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
. What the supporting evidence has to be is evidence that makes the judge sure that there was no mistake in the identification.
 
 
 
The learned Judge of Appeal went on to echo Lord Widgery`s dictum in 
 R v Turnbull 
 that odd coincidences can, if unexplained, be supporting evidence.
In 
PP v L (a minor)
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 219
 , I affirmed the correctness of the test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
. I also pointed out in that case that while all victims of crime naturally feel stress and shock, it is precisely the fact that they have been molested or otherwise that would cause them to take a really good look at the offender and commit his face to memory.
 The victim`s identification evidence 
 
 
 
I now move on to the victim`s identification evidence. The victim testified that, just as she was about to begin showering, she turned round and saw the appellant`s face looking at her. After she shouted at him, he nevertheless continued staring at her for a few more seconds before leaving. The shower cubicle was lit at the time and the distance between them was less than one metre. The victim also gave a description of the offender, citing features like his eyes, teeth and fairness of his skin in her identification evidence. It was not disputed that these features matched those of the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant accepted that the three step test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
 applied to this case. He submitted that the answer to the first of the questions as to whether the case against the appellant wholly depended on the correctness of the identification evidence was in the affirmative. However, he argued that the quality of the identification evidence was in this case not good, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the appellant was made. Therefore, the district judge should have considered the third question of. whether there was any other evidence which supported the correctness of the victim`s identification.
I came to the conclusion that the quality of the victim`s identification evidence was good. The district judge cited four reasons for arriving at this result. The appellant only attacked one of these, namely, her finding that there was sufficient light in the shower cubicle which enabled the victim to see the offender`s facial features. He pointed out that in the court below, the district judge herself commented on the lack of bright lighting in the female bathroom and that the lit parts in the photographs came from the camera flash.
From the photographs tendered as evidence in the court below, it is clear that there were fluorescent lights in the female bathroom and above the shower cubicles. The district judge made it clear that, while she did not accept that the female bathroom was brightly lit, there was nonetheless enough light to enable the victim to see the appellant`s features clearly. What must further be noted was that counsel did not attack the other grounds cited by the district judge for finding that the quality of the identification evidence was good. At the risk of repetition, these were the proximity of the offender to the victim, the fact that he had looked at her face on and that she had had a good look at him for a few seconds. All of these factors fell squarely into the guidelines set out by Karthigesu JA which rendered the quality of the victim`s evidence very strong. Furthermore, as I emphasised in 
 PP v L (a minor) 
, the victim being on the receiving end of such a crime would have had the face of the offender emblazoned in her memory. The fact that she identified the appellant to the management of club within a short time of the incident taking place lent even more weight and credence to her identification evidence.
At any rate, the district judge had made a finding of fact that the victim had correctly identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the offence. It is trite law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn the trial judge`s finding of fact unless it can be shown that his decision was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence before him: 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , 
Ng Kwee Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 205
 , 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
  and 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
 . These cases thus stand for the principle that findings of fact by the trial judge are prima facie correct unless there are very good grounds for disturbing them.
Seeing as the district judge had applied her mind very carefully to the question of lighting and had, after considering all the evidence before her, reached the conclusion that there was enough light for the victim to recognise the features of the peeping Tom, counsel for the appellant did not have an easy task and indeed failed in his attempt to overturn this finding.
The answer to the second question in the guidelines must therefore be `yes`. Applying the three step test in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
, there was no need to consider the presence of other supporting evidence for PW1`s identification evidence since the quality of the identification evidence was good.
 The need for corroborative evidence 
 
 
 
Counsel argued that an earlier decision of mine, 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
, made supporting evidence a necessary feature in this case as it involved a sexual offence.
The short and simple answer to this issue is this. I made it clear in 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
 that, where no one can sensibly say that no sexual offence has occurred, no corroboration warning need be given. Where the only live issue before the court is identification, a direction following the guidelines in 
 R v Turnbull 
 would suffice. Hence, there was no need in the present situation for corroborative evidence as long as the guidelines set out in 
 Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP 
 have been followed.
 Whether the district judge erred in disbelieving the appellant`s version of events 
 
 
 
I now turn to the final issue in the appeal. Counsel for the appellant contended that the district judge erred in finding that there was a material discrepancy between the evidence of the appellant and DW2 with regard to when and how they met each other after the appellant had completed his work. His main ground of complaint was that the district judge totally ignored DW2`s evidence that, when he saw the appellant, the appellant was holding two cans of Coke and that, when DW2 asked the appellant where Rahimah was, the appellant informed him that she had gone to do some other checking. The fact that the appellant was holding two cans of Coke in fact corroborated the appellant`s evidence that he had bought two cans, one for Rahimah and the other for himself, and showed that there was no material discrepancy between the testimonies of the appellant and DW2.
In my opinion, what counsel failed to appreciate was that the appellant gave evidence that, after checking the water tank, he went to the cafeteria and saw Rahimah sitting in the lobby. He bought two cans of Coke and offered her one which she declined. They discussed the project for ten minutes. He then saw DW2 coming towards them and spoke to him for a while more, 
 remaining 
 in the lobby for another ten minutes or so. This was in direct contradiction to DW2`s evidence that he found the appellant in the Video Games Room 
 alone 
. These two witnesses were supposed to have been recounting the same factual situation, yet it is clear as day that the stories diverge. In DW2`s evidence, Rahimah only joined him and the appellant 10 to 15 minutes after the appellant had come out of the Video Games Room and they had sat down in the lobby to discuss the project. There was no reason for DW2 to lie, being a witness for the defence and the appellant`s employer. As such, it is evident that the district judge did not err in disbelieving the appellant`s version of events and rejecting his defence that he was not in the female bathroom at the material time.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that the district judge failed to consider the surrounding factual circumstances that would have led her to conclude that the appellant`s behaviour was consistent with that of an innocent man. The more relevant items include the fact that, when DW2 wanted to do some further checking and walked in the direction of the toilets, the appellant willingly went along. Upon seeing the couple, he did not run away and instead carried on walking to the pump room. There was no attempt by the appellant to run away when he was asked to return to the club by Management. He had maintained his innocence when confronted at the lobby and in fact wanted the management of the club not to let the couple go for falsely accusing him. In addition. he willingly gave his particulars to the Management when asked to do so.
Furthermore, the appellant submitted that the victim despite having two occasions to identify the appellant as the peeping Tom, failed to do so. She never pointed him out even when she was at the security counter. This behaviour showed that the victim herself was not sure whether the appellant was the offender.
I have already considered the principles relating to an appeal against a trial judge`s finding of fact. In this case, the factors cited by the appellant that he claimed were not taken into account by the district judge were not crucial to her finding of fact that the appellant was guilty of peeping at the victim. His behaviour neither proved nor disproved his innocence. The district judge clearly believed the identification evidence of the victim and took into account the material discrepancy between the appellant`s and DW2`s evidence of whether the appellant was alone or with Rahimah when DW2 met him. It was also fallacious for the appellant to say that the victim never pointed him out as the offender. It was both her and her boyfriend`s testimonies that she had identified the appellant as the peeping Tom to her boyfriend. This clearly had to be so as the management would otherwise have had no reason to stop the appellant and his colleagues from leaving the club. All the above evidence formed the basis of the district judge`s decision that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offence under s 509. As the appellant has not shown that her decision was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, there was no reason to overturn her findings of fact.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the premises, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the appellant`s conviction and sentence.

GLEESON  CJ,  GUMMOW,  HAYNE,  CALLINAN  AND  HEYDON  JJ.      The 
appellants  were  tried  jointly,  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  South  Australia,  before 
Debelle J  and  a  jury,  and  convicted  of  murder,  wounding  with  intent  to  do 
grievous  bodily  harm,  and  attempted  armed  robbery.    They  were  sentenced  to 
lengthy terms of imprisonment.  A co-accused, Carlos Escalante, pleaded guilty 
to  murder,  wounding  with  intent  to  do  grievous  bodily  harm,  and  attempted 
armed robbery. 
 
 
Each appellant appealed unsuccessfully to the South Australian Court of 
Criminal  Appeal.    For  reasons  that  are  presently  immaterial,  the  appeals  were 
heard by differently constituted courts1.  The appeal to this Court concerns only 
the  convictions  of  murder,  and,  as  will  appear,  the  grounds  of  appeal  are 
relatively confined. 
 
The facts 
 
 
The events giving rise to the charges occurred at Stepney, an inner suburb 
of  Adelaide,  in  the  early  hours  of  Saturday  11 December  1999.    The  two 
appellants, with three other men (Carlos Escalante, Raylon Smith and Christian 
Sinclair),  were  in  a  stolen  car.    They  agreed  to  find  someone  to  ""roll""  for  a 
mobile  telephone.    The  appellant  Mkoka  agreed  in  cross-examination  that  this 
meant robbery involving force if necessary.  
 
 
The  five  men  were  travelling  away  from  the  city,  along  North  Terrace 
towards  its  intersection  with  Fullarton  Road.    As  the  car  approached  the 
intersection,  Sinclair,  who  was  in  the  front  passenger  seat,  noticed  two  men, 
Hillam  and  Bourne,  walking  in  the  same  direction  along  the  north  western 
footpath of North Terrace.  Hillam was speaking on a mobile telephone.  The car 
stopped  a  short  distance  behind  Hillam  and  Bourne.    The  two  appellants  and 
Escalante  left  the  car.    The  appellant  Mkoka  was  armed  with  a  cue  ball  in  a 
stocking (described as a ""cosh"").  The appellant Arulthilakan had with him in the 
car a knife wrapped in cardboard.  That knife came into the possession of Mkoka.  
Arulthilakan  said  that  he  took  the  knife,  still  wrapped  in  cardboard,  from  his 
jacket pocket, intending to leave it on the back seat of the car.  Mkoka asked if he 
could take the knife with him.  Arulthilakan agreed.

Escalante was also carrying a knife.  It was not in dispute that this was the 
knife that was used  to stab Hillam and Bourne. The  blade  of Escalante's  knife 
was about 18 centimetres long.  Its maximum width was 2.8 centimetres.  Mkoka 
was aware that Escalante regularly carried a knife, and he knew Escalante was 
carrying a knife on this occasion.  Arulthilakan said that he knew Escalante had a 
knife, and, of course, he had given Mkoka his own knife.   
 
 
The two appellants and Escalante accosted Hillam and Bourne, who kept 
walking.    They  crossed  the  intersection  diagonally  towards  a  hotel,  which  was 
closed.    The  three  men  followed.    Escalante  made  aggressive  demands  for  the 
mobile phone.  Hillam told the three men to go away.  Escalante rushed at him.  
Hillam punched Escalante and then felt a blow to his side.  He looked down and 
saw  that  he  had  been  stabbed.  Hillam  sustained  four  wounds.    Two  were 
relatively  minor: to the outside  of the left knee and to the left leg.  Two were 
substantial: one to the left chest, and another to the left flank.  He sought help 
from a passing taxi driver, entered the taxi, and asked the driver to take him to 
hospital.   
 
 
Meanwhile, Mkoka had moved towards Bourne when Escalante attacked 
Hillam.    He  dropped  the  knife  he  had  been  given  by  Arulthilakan  and  put  the 
cosh in his right hand.  He dropped the knife in order to get a better grip on the 
cosh.  He said that ""obviously a fight had started and [he] thought [Bourne] might 
go  and  help  [Hillam]  in  beating  up  [Escalante]"".    Mkoka  said  Bourne  came 
towards him.  There was a struggle between the two.  Mkoka said he swung the 
cosh  at  Bourne  and  hit  him  somewhere  in  the  upper  body.    There  followed  a 
period of grappling between the two, during which Mkoka attempted to use the 
cosh.  At some point in the struggle, Escalante intervened and stabbed Bourne.  
Mkoka  and  Bourne  fell  to  the  ground,  still  struggling.    Mkoka  then  struck 
Bourne, who released his grip.  Mkoka kicked him in the upper body.  Mkoka 
said he did not know of the stabbing of Bourne until they were back in the car.   
 
 
Hillam  gave  evidence  that  when  he  looked  back  from  the  taxi  he  saw 
Bourne in the middle of the intersection being kicked and punched by all three 
men.  
 
 
Bourne's death resulted from a stab wound to the right side of his chest, 
between the fifth and sixth ribs.  Expert evidence explained that the knife caused 
a puncture wound in the right atrium of Bourneâ€™s heart and the resultant blood 
loss would have caused death within a few minutes.  There were other lacerations 
on his scalp consistent with blows from a blunt object.  There was no dispute at 
trial that the fatal blow was struck immediately before Bourne fell to the ground.

There was no specific evidence as to the total time that elapsed from when 
the  appellants  and  Escalante  alighted  from  the  car  until  the  fatal  stabbing  of 
Bourne.  In his summing up, the trial judge, without objection, suggested that it 
appeared from the evidence to have been a period of at most about two or three 
minutes. 
 
 
At the trial, the appellants sought to make out a case of self-defence.  The 
trial judge declined to leave self-defence to the jury.  In both cases, the Court of 
Criminal  Appeal  upheld  that  decision.    The  case  of  self-defence  was  hopeless, 
and the argument was not pursued in this Court.  The central issue in the present 
appeal concerns the complicity of the appellants in the stabbing by Escalante of 
Bourne.    In  that  respect,  the  defence  case  was  that  the  stabbing  of  Bourne  by 
Escalante was an independent act on his part, undertaken in the heat of an affray, 
and after any attempt at robbery had ceased.  Plainly, that case was rejected by 
the jury. 
 
The prosecution case of murder 
 
 
The prosecution case against each appellant on the charge of murder was 
left  to  the  jury  on  three  alternative  bases:  the  first  two  related  to  murder  at 
common law; the third related to what was described as statutory murder.  The 
grounds of appeal in this Court are confined to the directions given concerning 
statutory murder. 
 
 
In  relation  to  common  law  murder,  the  directions  proceeded  upon  the 
basis  that  the  prosecution  had  to  establish  that  Escalante  stabbed  Bourne, 
intending either to kill him, or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm.  On that 
assumption,  the  first  basis  on  which  murder  was  left  was  described  as  joint 
enterprise.  The prosecution case was that the two appellants were acting jointly 
with Escalante in pursuit of a common unlawful purpose (armed robbery) which 
could involve inflicting at least grievous bodily harm.  The jury were told that it 
was  necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  that  the  scope  of  the  agreement  or 
understanding between the three was such that the crime committed by Escalante 
was  either  in  their  actual  contemplation  or,  alternatively,  it  was  in  their 
contemplation that it was possible that one of them might, in the course of the 
attempted robbery, use a knife to cause grievous bodily harm.  The second basis 
was that the appellants aided and abetted Escalante in the murder of Bourne.  In 
that connection, the jury were told that the prosecution had to prove knowledge 
that Escalante intended to stab Bourne, and assistance or encouragement in the 
commission of the crime.  It is unnecessary to go into further detail concerning 
the case of common law murder.

In the alternative, the jury were invited to consider statutory murder.  As 
counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted,  the  possibility  that  the  jury  convicted  on 
the  Criminal  Law 
this  basis  cannot  be  disregarded. 
Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) provides: 
 

  Section 12A  of 

""12A.  A person who commits an intentional act of violence while acting 
in the course or furtherance of a major indictable offence punishable by 
imprisonment for ten years or more (other than abortion), and thus causes 
the death of another, is guilty of murder."" 

Armed  robbery  is  a  major  indictable  offence  of  the  kind  referred  to  in 

 
s 12A.   
 
The directions on statutory murder 
 
 
The trial judge began by telling the jury that the crime of statutory murder 
does not require an intention on the part of the accused to cause death or grievous 
bodily harm; the crime is committed if death results from an intentional act of 
violence perpetrated while acting in the course of or in furtherance of an armed 
robbery.  He said the first question for the jury to consider was whether the act of 
violence relied on by the prosecution was committed in the course of an armed 
robbery.  The case for the appellants was that, by the time any use of weapons 
occurred,  they  and  Escalante  were  resisting  a  counter-attack  from  Hillam  and 
Bourne, and defending themselves.  At least theoretically, therefore, there was an 
open question as to whether the act of violence (said to be the presentation of a 
knife by Escalante) occurred in the course of the robbery.  The defence claimed 
that, by the time the alleged act of violence had occurred, the attempted robbery 
was over.  The trial judge continued: 
 

 
""However, if you are satisfied of that fact, you must then consider 
three other questions.  The first is, was there an act of violence?  Ladies 
and gentlemen, I direct you, as a matter of law, that the introduction of the 
knife into this affray, for the purpose of threatening or intimidating, or for 
the purpose of stabbing another, is an act of violence.  It constitutes a form 
of assault.  If you find that Escalante presented the knife for the purpose of 
threatening or intimidating Hillam, or for the purpose of stabbing him, that 
constitutes an act of violence.  As you will hear in a moment, that is the 
act of violence upon which the prosecution relies. 

 
The next matter is whether the act of violence was intentional.  You 
may  think  that  the  presenting  of  the  knife  and  use  of  it  requires  a 
deliberate and intentional act.  It is not something which inadvertently or
--------

J

J 

5. 

accidentally  occurs.    It  is  for  you  to  determine  whether  the  knife  was 
intentionally presented and used. 

 
The next question is  whether the act  of violence caused Bourne's 
death.  Ladies and gentlemen, the law takes a commonsense view about 
causation.  It looks  to see if there is a causal link or a causal connection 
between one act and another.  Did one act cause another to occur?  The act 
does not have to be the sole cause of the other act occurring.  It is enough 
if it is a substantial cause.  It is enough if it is shown that, but for that one 
event, all the other events would not have happened as they did. 

 
It is the Crown case that if the knife had not been  presented and 
used at the commencement of this attempted armed robbery, the death of 
Bourne could not have occurred.  It says that, having presented the knife, 
Escalante used it to stab Hillam and then to stab Bourne.  The Crown says 
he  was  attacking  both  for  the  purpose  of  the  armed  robbery,  or  for  the 
purpose of extricating themselves from it.  The defence says there is no 
possible causal link between the presenting of the knife at that early stage 
in the robbery, and the later stabbing of Bourne.  It says that Escalante had 
become  very  aggressive,  that  he  was  acting  quite  independently  of  the 
others, and that he made a separate decision to stab Bourne.    

 
You  will  decide,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  whether  you  are  satisfied 
that the presenting of the knife at the very outset of this attempted armed 
robbery caused Bourne's death. 

 
If you are satisfied the act of violence was committed whilst all the 
accused were in the course of the attempted armed robbery, or extricating 
themselves from it, there are two alternative routes by which it is open for 
you to find these accused guilty of statutory murder.  Again, it is either by 
the route of joint enterprise, or by the route of aiding and abetting. 

 
As to joint enterprise, if you are satisfied that all of the accused had 
the  common  purpose  that  they  would  roll  or  rob  Hillam,  and  for  the 
purpose of their joint enterprise they would be armed with knives and a 
billiard ball, that they would use the knives and billiard ball if necessary to 
achieve their purpose  in the  course of the attempted armed  robbery,  the 
knives or billiard ball would be used to threaten or intimidate the victims.  
I  realise  that  sounds  very  similar  to  the  concept  of  joint  enterprise  in 
relation  to  common  law  murder,  but  it  is  different  in  that  it  is  not 
necessary that any of the accused had an intention to cause death,  or to 
cause grievous bodily harm, or contemplated as part of the joint enterprise
--------

Gummow  J

J 
 

the  possibility  that  the  use  of  the  knives  could  result  in  an  intentional 
inflicting of grievous bodily harm.  That is the difference between them. 

6. 
 

 
The case for both the Crown and the defence on this issue are very 
similar to those I have already outlined in relation to common law murder.  
As to joint enterprise, the prosecution says that all of this occurred in the 
course of the armed robbery, or whilst they were endeavouring to extricate 
themselves  from  it  and  remove  themselves  from  the  scene.    The 
prosecution says that this all plainly occurred in the course of the armed 
robbery.  Resistance, says the Crown, is always a real likelihood if you are 
going to commit an armed robbery.  They met that resistance.  Thus, they 
were  inextricably  involved  in  this  attempt  and  had  to  escape  from  it.  
Thus, says the Crown, it is plain that all of this occurred in the course of 
the commission of the armed robbery, and that the initial presentation of 
the knife for its use to threaten or to stab Hillam was a cause of the death 
of Bourne. 

 
The defence case, of course, is that by this time the robbery was all 
over, if it had ever started.  The defence case is that it was quite unrealistic 
to suppose that by the time these events occurred the robbery â€“ there was 
any commission of an attempted armed robbery.  I remind you of what I 
have already said in relation to that in the context of either common law 
murder or the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 
The  defence  also  says  that  in  no  respect  is  it  fair  to  say  or  to 
conclude  that  the  initial  presenting  of  this  knife  at  the  early  stage  of 
attempted armed robbery, even if it was on foot, caused Bourne's death.  
Escalante was behaving, they said, quite aggressively and independently. 

 
Similarly, in the case of the question whether they aided or abetted 
Escalante in the commission of the offence, this is much the same as in 
relation to the earlier offences.  The prosecution case is that they did aid 
and  abet,  and  that  they  both  willingly  engaged  in  the  attempted  armed 
robbery, and that indicates their intent. 

 
The defence case is that there was a fight, each defending the other; 
they had no idea that knives would be used in the fight.  Mkoka, indeed, 
had  thrown  his  away.    All  they  were  doing  was  acting  in  their  own 
defence and in defence of each other."" 

17 

The  trial  judge  returned  to  the  matter  of  causation  at  the  end  of  his 

 
summing-up, when he said:

""You  have  to  be  satisfied  that  there  is  a  causal  link  between  the 
introduction of the knife into the affray, and the death of Bourne.  It is the 
Crown  case  that  if  the  knife  had  not  been  presented  and  used  at  the 
commencement  of  this  attempted  armed  robbery,  the  death  of  Bourne 
could not have occurred.  The Crown says that having introduced the knife 
into the affray, Escalante used it to stab Hillam, and then to stab Bourne.  
The Crown says he was attacking both Hillam and Bourne for the purpose 
of the armed robbery. 

 
The  defence,  I  repeat,  says  there  is  absolutely  no  possible  causal 
link between the presenting of the knife at this early stage of the affray, 
this  early  introduction  of  it  into  the  affray,  and  the  stabbing  of  Bourne, 
which, on any view, had to have occurred later.  It says that Escalante had 
become  very  aggressive.    It  says  not  even  Hillam  saw  the  knife  being 
presented.  It says that Escalante's aggression was such that he was acting 
quite  independently,  and  that  he  made  quite  a  separate  decision  to  stab 
Bourne  ...  so  says  the  defence,  there  is  no  causal  link  between  the 
introduction  of  this  knife  at  the  beginning  of  this  affray,  and  the  later 
stabbing of Bourne."" 

18 

19 

20 

 
To put into context the references, in explaining the defence case, to an 
""early stage of the affray"", and what occurred ""later"", it is to be remembered that 
the entire episode occupied about two or three minutes. 
 
 
In relation to the directions on causation, to which no objection was taken, 
it is to be noted that what the trial judge said about the subject was, of course, 
closely related to the competing cases as fought at the trial.  The defence case on 
causation was that Escalante's use of his knife was not part of the armed robbery 
which  all  three  men  had  undertaken  but  was,  rather,  an  independent  act  of 
aggression on his part in response to the violence that erupted when Hillam and 
Bourne resisted their pursuers.  The prosecution case was that Escalante's use of 
his  knife  was  part  of  the  armed  robbery,  and  that  the  response  of  Hillam  and 
Bourne was foreseeable and, indeed, the very kind of contingency for which the 
attackers  had  prepared  by  arming  themselves  with  knives  and  a  cosh.    Those 
were the competing views of the facts to which the concept of causation had to 
be applied.  
 
The grounds of appeal 
 
 
 

Two criticisms are now made of the directions set out above.

The  first  criticism  relates  to  the  first  paragraph  in  the  directions  quoted 
and, in particular, to the statement that, as a matter of law, the presentation of the 
knife by Escalante constituted an act of violence.  The respondent acknowledges 
that it would have been better if the learned judge had directed the jury that it was 
open to them to find as a fact that the presentation of the knife constituted an act 
of violence, or that the presentation of the knife was capable of being regarded as 
an act of violence.  Nevertheless, the respondent points to the whole of what was 
said in the paragraph, and to the hypothesis upon which the direction ""as a matter 
of law"" was given.  The jury were told that, if they found that Escalante presented 
the knife for the purpose of threatening or intimidating Hillam, or for the purpose 
of stabbing him, then that constituted an act of violence. 
 
In a report to the Court of Criminal Appeal the trial judge said:  ""The issue 
 
whether  the  presenting  of  the  knife  was  an  act  of  violence  was  argued  as  a 
question of law by all counsel.  No one objected to the manner in which it was 
left to the jury."" 
 
 
Whether an act is an act of violence is a question of fact.  There may be a 
question of law as to  whether an act is capable of being regarded  as an act of 
violence.  The judge invited the jury to find as a fact whether Escalante presented 
his knife for the purpose of threatening, or intimidating, or stabbing the owner of 
the mobile telephone.  On the assumption that they made such a finding of fact, 
the  jury  were  told  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  conduct  involved  an  act  of 
violence.  They should have been told that, as a matter of law, the conduct was 
capable of being regarded as an act of violence.  In the circumstances, however, 
it  makes  little  difference.    How  else  might  such  conduct  have  been  regarded?  
The  complaint  of  the  appellants  is  that  the  direction  foreclosed  an  issue.    In  a 
practical sense, there was no real issue.  If the jury made the finding of fact which 
formed  the  condition  upon  which  the  direction  of  law  was  given,  it  was  not 
reasonably  open  to  them  to  come  to  any  conclusion  other  than  that  the 
presentation  of  the  knife  was  an  act  of  violence.    The  directions  went  on  to 
outline  the  defence  case,  and  to  remind  the  jury  of  the  arguments  advanced 
against the conclusion of fact for which the prosecution contended.  If, however, 
that conclusion were drawn, then the further conclusion that what was involved 
was an act of violence was inescapable.  Technically, there was a misdirection, 
but it gave rise to no miscarriage of justice. 
 
The second criticism of the directions was not advanced either at trial or in 
 
the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It relates to what was said concerning causation.  
The ground of appeal is expressed as follows:

In  argument,  counsel  for  the  appellants  directed  attention  particularly  to 
 
the concluding sentence of the third of the paragraphs from the directions quoted 
above.  They submitted that a proper direction would have been that causation 
was a matter of fact for the jury, to be determined, applying common sense, but 
with an appreciation that they were deciding legal responsibility and that the act 
for which the accused was responsible must be a substantial or significant cause 
in  a  common  sense  and  practical  way,  but  need  not  be  the  sole  cause.    When 
those submissions are compared with what the trial judge said, it is evident that 
the principal difference is in the sentence earlier mentioned, and in particular, in 
the reference to a ""but for"" approach to causation.  The respondent agreed with 
the appellants as to what was described as ""the status of the 'but for' test in civil 
and criminal law"" and contended that, if there was a misdirection, there was no 
miscarriage of justice.  Reference was made on both sides to the judgments in 
this Court in Royall v The Queen2. 
 
 
the  question  of  causation  arose  required 
consideration  of  whether  an  intentional  act  of  violence  (the  presentation  by 
Escalante of a knife for one of the purposes earlier mentioned) in the course or 
furtherance  of  an  armed  robbery  was  a  cause  of  the  death  of  Bourne.    The 
defence  case  was  that  Escalante  was  acting,  not  in  the  course  of  the  planned 
robbery, but independently in response to the conduct of Hillam and Bourne, the 
attempted robbery having come to an end.

In Ryan v The Queen3, Windeyer J, dealing with the common law concept 

 
of felony murder, said4: 
 

10. 
 

 
""There was a time when a man was guilty of murder, and punished 
accordingly, if while doing any unlawful act he happened to kill another 
man, however unexpectedly and unintentionally.  This harsh rule became 
gradually  mitigated.   By  the eighteenth century, although a  man  who in 
the course of committing a crime unintentionally killed another might still 
for that reason be guilty of murder, this was only when the crime was a 
felony.  By the middle of the nineteenth century doubts had begun to be 
expressed  about  this  doctrine  ...    The  generally  accepted  rule  of  the 
common law today is, however, that an unintended killing in the course of 
or  in  connexion  with  a  felony  is  murder  if,  but  only  if,  the  felonious 
conduct involved violence or danger to some person."" 

 
In South Australia, the law on the subject is now to be found in s 12A; but 
what  was  said  by  Windeyer J  explains  the  genesis  of  the  statutory  provision.  
Causing the death of another by committing an intentional act of violence in the 
course  of  a  major  indictable  offence,  even  though  there  is  no  intent  to  kill  or 
cause grievous bodily harm, constitutes statutory murder. 
 
 
There  was  nothing  artificial  about  the  prosecution's  identification  of  the 
intentional act of violence on which it relied.  The plan upon which the appellants 
and  Escalante  embarked  was  to  ""roll""  Hillam  in  order  to  obtain  his  mobile 
telephone.  That involved robbery, accompanied, if necessary, by force.  Perhaps 
there  was  a  theoretical  possibility  that  Hillam  would  hand  over  the  telephone 
without resistance, but the three intending robbers had, between them, two knives 
and a cosh.  They were not intending to rely on their powers of verbal persuasion.  
They  had  equipped  themselves  to  deal  with  resistance.    The  appellants  knew 
Escalante was armed.  It was not difficult to infer why he was armed.  The jury 
came to the matter of causation on the assumption that they had already found 
that  Escalante  presented  his  knife  to  Hillam  for  the  purpose  of  threatening  or 
intimidating  or  stabbing  him.    That  was  how  he  introduced  his  knife  into  the 
proceedings.  That was an intentional act of violence, in the course or furtherance 
of a robbery.  Bearing in mind the events that unfolded, and the brief interval of 
time  in  which  they  occurred,  it  was  open  to  the  jury  to  find  that  the  act  of

violence was a substantial cause of the death of Bourne.  Once the jury found that 
Escalante had presented a knife to Hillam for the purpose described, then it was 
open to them to  reason that  the resistence of Hillam and Bourne,  the resulting 
struggle, and the fatal stabbing of Bourne, were all part of a sequence of events 
resulting from the act of violence.   Of course, the defence endeavoured to put a 
different complexion on the events.  But the jury rejected the defence case.  The 
question is whether there was error in the way in which the prosecution case was 
left to them and, if so, whether there was a miscarriage of justice. 
 
 
In  some  contexts,  the  identification  of  an  act  as  causing  the  death  of  a 
victim may be important because it will affect issues of voluntariness, intent, or 
other  matters  relevant  to  the  offence  charged.    Ryan5  and  Royall6  provide 
examples of the relationship between such issues and questions of causation.  In 
Ryan, where the accused shot the deceased, there were a number of possible, and 
significantly different, views open as to the manner in which the gun discharged.

Lee Seiu KinÂ J:
Introduction
1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This is an application by the Public Prosecutor for the exercise of the High Courtâ€™s powers of revision under sÂ 266 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CapÂ 68, 1985Â Rev Ed)(â€œCPCâ€) to examine the record of the District Court proceedings in DACÂ 33059 of 2008 (â€œDAC 33059â€). The petitioner submitted that I should also exercise my powers under sÂ 268 read with sÂ 256(c) of the CPC to alter the sentence imposed on the respondent by District Judge Sarjit Singh (â€œthe District Judgeâ€) on the ground that it was wrong in law. DAC 33059 pertained to an offence under sÂ 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (CapÂ 185, 2008Â Rev Ed)(â€œMDAâ€) and is punishable under sÂ 33 of that Act. However if there are two previous convictions under sÂ 8(b) of the MDA, sÂ 33A(1)(b) would apply to impose a minimum imprisonment term of five years and caning of not less than three strokes and not more then six strokes of the cane. In 2001, the respondent had been brought before a Juvenile Court and charged under sÂ 8(b)(ii) of the MDA for consumption of methamphetamine. The Juvenile Court had made a finding of guilt and ordered him to reside in an approved school for 32 months. The prosecution submitted to the District Judge that the Juvenile Court proceedings constituted a â€œprevious convictionâ€ under sÂ 33A(1). However the District Judge disagreed and sentenced him under sÂ 33 instead of sÂ 33A. The question of law before me is whether the Juvenile Court proceedings constituted a â€œprevious convictionâ€ under sÂ 33A of the MDA (â€œthe Issueâ€).
Background
2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The facts are as follows. On 10 September 2008, before District Judge Sarjit Singh (â€œthe District Judgeâ€) in Subordinate Court NoÂ 4, the respondent pleaded guilty to five charges, namely DAC 31028, 32070, 33057, 33058 and 33059 of 2008. The respondent was convicted of the offences and consented to three other charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing pursuant to sÂ 178 of the CPC. The District Judge adjourned the case to 29Â SeptemberÂ 2008 for sentencing. However on that adjourned date, the District Judge required submissions on the Issue and the prosecution requested an adjournment to check on the point. The matter was adjourned to 16Â OctoberÂ 2008, but the prosecution was not ready to submit on that date and a further adjournment was granted, to 30Â OctoberÂ 2008. OnÂ 30 OctoberÂ 2008, after the prosecution made its submissions, the District Judge adjourned the case for sentencing on 7Â NovemberÂ 2008. However at that adjourned hearing, the prosecution applied for a further adjournment and the hearing was re-scheduled to 26Â NovemberÂ 2008. But on 26Â NovemberÂ 2008 the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (â€œCLASâ€) of the Law Society had put in an application for adjournment so that it can consider assigning counsel to argue the Issue fully. The District Judge granted the application and adjourned the hearing to 19Â DecemberÂ 2008. On that new date, CLAS instructed MsÂ Josephine Choo to act for the respondent and she made her submissions on the Issue to the District Judge. However MsÂ Choo requested an adjournment to consider the earlier submission of the prosecution which she had just received in order to make her reply. The District Judge adjourned the hearing to 16Â JanuaryÂ 2009. On that date, after both sides made further submissions, the District Judge made his ruling on the Issue. On 20Â JanuaryÂ 2009 the District Judge sentenced the respondent to various punishments on the five charges. In relation to DAC 33059, as he held that sÂ 33A of the MDA was not applicable, he sentenced the respondent to three yearsâ€™ imprisonment under sÂ 33 of the MDA, which had no provision for caning.
3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There was no appeal against the decision of the District Judge within the time fixed for appealing (or at all). The respondent had been in remand all the while and the sentence of caning imposed on him, a total of 12 strokes in relation to DAC 31028 and 32070 of 2008 was duly carried out. Had the respondent been sentenced under the provisions of sÂ 33A of the MDA, he would have received at least another three strokes of the cane.
4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â On 13Â MarchÂ 2009, some one and a half months after the District Judge had decided on the matter, the deputy public prosecutor (â€œMr Ngâ€) wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and requested that DAC 33059 be placed before the High Court for the purpose of this criminal revision. On 30Â AprilÂ 2009 after hearing submissions from Mr Ng and from counsel for the respondent, Mr Tan, I reserved judgment on the determination of the Issue. However I was of the view that, even if I were to decide the Issue in accordance with the petitionerâ€™s position, I would not be inclined to disturb the sentence. My reasons for so doing are as follows.
5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The revisionary power of the High Court is vested by sÂ 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (CapÂ 322, 2007Â Rev Ed) which provides as follows:
The High Court may exercise powers of revision in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure.
The relevant written law relating to criminal procedure is the CPC and sÂ 266(1) thereof provides that the High Court â€œmay call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate courtâ€. If the High Court determines that any finding, sentence or order of the subordinate court is not correct, legal or improper, or any proceedings thereof is irregular, sÂ 268(1) provides that the court may, â€œin its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sectionsÂ 251, 255, 256 and 257â€. It should be noted that sÂ 268(1) does not require the court to make an order on every occasion that it finds a defect in the finding, sentence or order of, or in the proceedings in, the subordinate court. It gives the court the discretion to act.
6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â What, then, are the factors that the court takes into account in the exercise of this discretion? In 
Ang Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, Yong Pung How CJ analysed the Indian authorities on the subject and held (atÂ 330C) that for the court to be moved to act, â€œthere must be some serious injusticeâ€. He further said (atÂ 330C) that â€œgenerally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court belowâ€. In the next paragraph, he said that it was clearly not the intention of the statute for the revisionary jurisdiction to be â€œlittle more than another form of appealâ€. More recently, in 
Yunani bin Abdul Hamid v Public Prosecutor
 
[2008] 3 SLR 383
, VÂ KÂ RajahÂ JA held (at [46] and [49]) as follows:
46Â Â Â Â â€¦ The revisionary jurisdiction must not be exercised in such a way that a right of appeal may practically be given whenever such right is definitely excluded by the statutory provisions on criminal procedure (
per
 PiggottÂ J in the Allahabad High Court in 
Ahsan-ullah Khan v Mansukh Ram
 1914 (36)Â ILR All 403 at 405). It is not the purpose of criminal revision to become a convenient form of â€œbackdoor appealâ€ against conviction for accused persons who have pleaded guilty to the charges against them (
per
 Yong Pung HowÂ CJ in 
Teo Hee HengÂ v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 168
 at [7]). The courts have therefore formulated certain principles to guide the prudent exercise of this extraordinary power.
â€¦
49Â Â Â Â I agree with the cautious and limited exercise of the High Courtâ€™s revisionary power as stated in [46]â€“[47] above. This extraordinary judicial power must not be regarded or exercised as an alternative appellate route (a point which I mentioned earlier at [46] above). However, it also has to be kept in mind that Parliament has conferred this power on the High Court so as to ensure that no potential cases of serious injustice are left without a meaningful remedy or real redress. A court would fail in its constitutional duty to oversee the administration of criminal justice if it remains impassive and unresponsive to what may objectively appear to be a potentially serious miscarriage of justice â€¦
7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In exercising my discretion not to disturb the sentence, I took into consideration the fact that the ordinary manner in which the petitioner would have gone about this, if dissatisfied with the finding of the District Judge or the sentence, would be to lodge an appeal. Whatever may have been the reason, this was not done. The petitioner submitted that an appeal was not possible â€œsince the extent or legality of the sentence imposed by the learned District Judge is not in issueâ€. With respect, I see no merit in this submission. If the District Judge was wrong in not sentencing the respondent under sÂ 33A instead of sÂ 33, it certainly would have constituted ground for appeal. Further, this petition for criminal revision was made some one and a half months after the time limit for an appeal has expired. Even if I did not consider that this petition to exercise my revisionary power is tantamount to a back door appeal, the delay is certainly relevant. Indeed, by the time this petition came up before me, the sentence of caning had been carried out. If I were to enhance the sentence, the respondent would have been liable to a further round of caning for a further three strokes at the very least. Disturbing the sentence below would, in the circumstances, result in further injustice rather than ameliorating an injustice. As the primary objective of the petitioner was to settle the law on the Issue and it was not necessary to disturb the sentence below in order to do it, there was no good reason to interfere with the order of the District Judge.
The Issue
8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I turn now to consider the Issue. The respondent had been convicted in the District Court in OctoberÂ 2003 for consumption of methamphetamine under sÂ 8(b) of the MDA and sentenced to three yearsâ€™ imprisonment. Two years earlier, in OctoberÂ 2001 when the respondent was 14 years old, he was brought before a Juvenile Court and charged under sÂ 8(b) of the MDA for consumption of methamphetamine. The Juvenile Court had made a finding of guilt and ordered him to reside in an approved school (the Singapore Boysâ€™ Home) for 32 months. The question is whether the Juvenile Court finding is a â€œprevious convictionâ€ for the purposes of sÂ 33A(1) of the MDA whereupon, in combination with the 2003 District Court conviction, the respondent would have had two previous convictions and the sentence would have to be determined in accordance with sÂ 33A of the MDA instead of sÂ 33.
9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The relevant parts of sÂ 33A are as follows:
(1)Â Â Â Â Where a person who has not less than â€”
â€¦
(b)Â Â Â Â 2 previous convictions for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(
b
);
â€¦
is convicted of an offence under section 8(
b
) for consumption of a specified drug â€¦ he shall on conviction be punished with â€”
(i)Â Â Â Â imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more than 7 years; and
(ii)Â Â Â not less than 3 strokes and not more than 6 strokes of the cane.
â€¦
(5)Â Â Â Â For the purposes of this section â€”
(a)Â Â Â Â a conviction under section 8(b) by a court including a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act at â€”
(i)Â Â Â Â any time on or after 1st October 1992 but before the relevant date for the consumption of a controlled drug which, on the date of any subsequent conviction, is specified in the Fourth Schedule; or
(ii)Â Â Â any time on or after the relevant date for the consumption of a specified drug,
shall be deemed to be a previous conviction for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b);
(b)Â Â Â Â a conviction under section 31(2) by a court including a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act at any time on or after 1st October 1992 shall be deemed to be a previous conviction for an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2) â€¦
10Â Â Â Â Â Save for sÂ 33A(5), which is irrelevant for present purposes, sÂ 33A and indeed the MDA is silent on what constitutes a â€œprevious convictionâ€, and specifically on whether a Juvenile Court finding of guilt constitutes a â€œprevious convictionâ€. It is therefore necessary to look at the Children and Young Persons Act (CapÂ 38, 2001Â Rev Ed)(â€œCYPAâ€) whose purposes include the establishment of a separate regime for the sentencing and treatment of children and young persons. A â€œchildâ€ is defined in sÂ 2 of the CYPA as a person who is below the age of 14 years and a â€œyoung personâ€ as one who is 14 years of age or above and below 16 years. The Juvenile Court is established under s 32Â of the CYPA and its jurisdiction set out in sÂ 33, of which subsection (1) provides that â€“ subject to certain exceptions â€“ no child or young person shall be charged with or tried for any offence by a court of summary jurisdiction except a Juvenile Court. The exceptions are found in subsectionÂ 2 (offences triable only in the High Court shall be tried there unless the Public Prosecutor applies to the Juvenile Court with the consent of the legal representative of the child or young person), subsection 3 (joint trial with a person who has attained the age of 16 years) and subsection 4 (where age is discovered in the course of proceedings). Section 35 places restrictions on the publication of proceedings in the Juvenile Court and prohibits disclosure of any information that may lead to the identification of the child or young person concerned in the proceedings. SectionÂ 37 limits the scope of punishment that may be imposed by a Juvenile Court: a child may not be sentenced to imprisonment and a young person may not be sentenced to imprisonment â€œunless the court certifies that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a place of detention or approved schoolâ€. Further, a Juvenile Court does not have power to sentence a child or young person to corporal punishment â€“ only the High Court may do so; sÂ 37(3). The following provisions are relevant to the determination of the Issue and I set them out in full below:
Removal of disqualification or disability on conviction
36.Â Â Â Â A conviction or finding of guilt of a child or young person shall be disregarded for the purposes of any Act under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon convicted persons.
Words â€œconvictionâ€ and â€œsentenceâ€ not to be used
41. â€”(1) The words â€œconvictionâ€ and â€œsentenceâ€ shall cease to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by a Juvenile Court.
(2)Â Â Â Â Any reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of a child or young person, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt or an order made upon such a finding, as the case may be.
11Â Â Â Â Â I first consider sÂ 41 of the CYPA. Subsection (1) thereof mandates that the terms â€œconvictionâ€ and â€œsentenceâ€ shall cease to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by a Juvenile Court. The intention behind this is clear from the Children and Young Persons Bill introduced on 16Â FebruaryÂ 1949 (Supplement NoÂ 9), in which the objects and reasons statement had the following in relation to clÂ 55 of the Bill which is the equivalent provision to sÂ 41 of the CYPA:
By clause 55 the terms â€œconvictionâ€ and â€œsentenceâ€ are no longer to be used in relation to children and young persons dealt with by Juvenile Courts, the expressions â€œfinding of guiltâ€ and â€œorder made upon finding of guiltâ€ are substituted for them.
12Â Â Â Â Â It is apparent that the legislature intended that children and young persons who have been charged in a Juvenile Court and found guilty of an offence should not be stigmatised by having a conviction to his name or considered to have been sentenced for an office. That the legislature did not intend, in this section, to go further than that is seen in sÂ 41(2), which provides that â€œ[a]ny reference in any written law to a person convicted, a conviction or a sentence shall, in the case of a child or young person, be construed as including a reference to a person found guilty of an offence, a finding of guiltâ€. Section 33A of the MDA is a written law which contains a reference to a person convicted of an offence. Section 41(2) would operate to construe such reference as including a reference to a finding of guilt in the Juvenile Court.
13Â Â Â Â Â I turn to consider sÂ 36 of the CYPA which provides that a finding of guilt of a child or young person â€œshall be disregarded for the purposes of any Act under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon convicted personsâ€. The question is whether sÂ 33A of the MDA imposes a â€œdisqualification or disabilityâ€ upon convicted persons. The respondent submitted that the provision for enhanced punishment for repeat offenders in sÂ 33A amounts to a â€œdisqualification or disability imposed upon convicted personsâ€ within the meaning of s 36 of the CYPA. The petitioner submitted that it is clearly not a â€œdisqualification or disabilityâ€.
14Â Â Â Â Â It would be useful to consider situations which clearly fall within the contemplation of sÂ 36 of the CYPA. Some legislation provide that a person who is convicted of an offence is disqualified from holding office, 
eg
 ArtÂ 45 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999Â Rev Ed) imposes a five year disqualification from being a Member of Parliament. Other legislation impose restrictions on employment, 
eg
 sÂ 78(1) of the Legal Profession Act (CapÂ 161, 2009Â Rev Ed) in relation to employment by a solicitor and sÂ 59(1) of the Accountants Act (CapÂ 2, 2005Â Rev Ed) in relation to employment by a public accountant. These situations are quite clearly a â€œdisqualification or disability imposed upon convicted personsâ€ and sÂ 36 of the CYPA operates to remove the effect of those provisions in the case of a person who is the subject of a finding of guilt in a Juvenile Court.
15Â Â Â Â Â It is not immediately obvious that a provision for enhanced punishment of repeat offenders such as sÂ 33A of the MDA falls within the scope of the words â€œdisqualification or disabilityâ€. Insofar as the word â€œdisqualificationâ€ is concerned, sÂ 33A does not disqualify the person from anything. The next question is whether it imposes a â€œdisabilityâ€. The ordinary meaning of that word also does not suggest that it does. An examination of the earlier incarnation of the CYPA, namely the Children and Young Persons Ordinance 1949 (â€œthe Ordinanceâ€) throws much illumination on the question. In the Ordinance, sÂ 50 and sÂ 55 are 
in pari materia
, respectively, with sÂ 36 and sÂ 41 of the CYPA. The Ordinance contains a provision, sÂ 72, of which there is no longer an equivalent in the CYPA, and which provides as follows:
(1)Â Â Â Â Where a child or young person is found guilty of an offence and is released under a probation order, the finding of guilt for that offence shall be disregarded for the purposes of any written law by or under which any disqualification or disability is imposed upon persons found guilty, or by or under which provision is made for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guilt:
Provided that if the probationer is subsequently sentenced for the original offence, this section shall cease to apply in respect of that offence, and he shall be deemed, for the purpose of any such written law imposing a disqualification or disability, to have been found guilty on the date of sentence.
(2)Â Â Â Â Where a person is released on probation without the Court having proceeded to a finding of guilt, and he is subsequently found guilty and sentenced for the original offence, then he shall be deemed, for the purpose of any written law by or under which any disqualification is imposed upon persons found guilty, or by or under which provision is made for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guilty, to have been found guilty on the date of such finding of guilt and sentence.
[emphasis added]
16Â Â Â Â Â It can be seen that under sÂ 72 of the Ordinance, where probation is ordered, the offence is to be disregarded for the purposes of any written law that imposes:
(a)Â Â Â Â Â any disqualification or disability upon a person found guilty of an offence; and
(b)Â Â Â Â Â a different penalty for a repeat offender.
The words â€œdifferent penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence or in respect of an offence committed after a previous finding of guiltâ€, which form limb (b) above, are not found in sÂ 50 of the Ordinance. It is clear that the policy in the Ordinance is that, in relation to a person who has a finding of guilt made against him by a Juvenile Court, such finding of guilt shall be disregarded for the purposes of any written law under which any disqualification or disability is imposed (sÂ 55 of the Ordinance), but if that person has been released under a probation order, such finding of guilt shall also be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which makes provision for a different penalty in respect of a repeat offender (sÂ 72 of the Ordinance).
17Â Â Â Â Â SectionÂ 72 was reincarnated in quite a different form in sÂ 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act (CapÂ 252, 1985Â Rev Ed)(â€œPOAâ€). Section 11 of the POA states as follows:
Effects of probation and discharge
.
11
.â€”(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, a conviction for an offence for which an order is made under this Act placing the offender on probation or discharging him absolutely or conditionally shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the foregoing provisions of this Act:
Provided that where an offender, beingÂ not less than 16 years of age at the time of his conviction forÂ an offence for which he is placed on probation or conditionally dischargedÂ as aforesaid, is subsequently sentenced under this Act for thatÂ offence, this subsection shall cease to apply to the conviction.
(2)Â Â Â Â Without prejudice to subsection (1), the conviction of an offender who is placed on probation or discharged absolutely or conditionally as aforesaid shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability.
(3)Â Â Â Â Subsections (1) and (2) shall not affect â€”
(a)Â Â Â Â any right of any such offender to appeal against his conviction, or to rely thereon in bar of any subsequent proceedings for the same offence; or
(b)Â Â Â Â the revesting or restoration of any property in consequence of any order made on the conviction of anyÂ such offender.
Under sÂ 11 of the POA, a probation order will still have the same effect as sÂ 72 of the Ordinance, although the manner in which sÂ 11 is drafted could entail wider consequences.
18Â Â Â Â Â I return to sÂ 50 of the Ordinance. Unlike sÂ 72 of the Ordinance, sÂ 50 does not contain the second limb relating to â€œdifferent penaltyâ€ for repeat offenders and in view of the clear dichotomy in sÂ 72, the words â€œdisqualification or disabilityâ€ in s 50 cannot incorporate the meaning contained in the second limb of sÂ 72. This position could not have been altered when sÂ 50 of the Ordinance was re-enacted as sÂ 36 of the CYPA in substantially the same terms. Accordingly, sÂ 36 of the CYPA has no effect on any provision in any act that makes provision for a different penalty in respect of a second or subsequent offence. Section 33A of the MDA is one such provision.
19Â Â Â Â Â For these reasons, I hold that a finding of guilt made by a Juvenile Court is a conviction for the purposes of sÂ 33A of the MDA. However, if the child or young person who is the subject of such a finding of guilt has been released under a probation order or had been discharged absolutely or conditionally, sÂ 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act would operate to deem such finding of guilt not to be a conviction for the purposes of sÂ 33A of the MDA.",18/8/2009 0:00,SG High Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KINGâ€™S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal lawâ€”Appealâ€”Jurisdictionâ€”Formal
judgment of appellate courtâ€”Mere mention of dissenting opinionâ€”Not specifying
grounds of dissentâ€”Section 1023 Cr. C.â€”Subsection 6 of section 1013 Cr. C.â€”21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14.

The appellant was convicted under subsection
(a) of s. 415 Cr. C. Upon
appeal, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court, the dissent of
one judge being merely mentioned in the formal judgment. Under a recent
amendment (s. 14 of c. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), subsection 6 was added to s. 1013
Cr. C. providing that, in case of a dissenting opinion, the formal judgment
should specify the grounds in . law on which such dissent was based. The Crown
contended that, owing to the failure of the appellate court so to specify the
grounds of dissent, an appeal to this Court was not open to the appellant.

Held that this
Court had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The only section of the
Criminal CodeÂ  dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023Â , under which the fact
that there has been a dissent on a question of law is the sole condition for
the foundation of its jurisdiction: the circumstance that the grounds of
dissent are not specified in the formal judgment of the appellate court does
not avoid the fact of there having been a dissent, which is the only
requirement contained in section 1023Â  Cr. C.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of
the Court of Kingâ€™s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by the Court of Kingâ€™s
Bench, criminal side.

The appellant was convicted of the following
offence: Being president and general manager of a company called

[Page 695]

Rayon Trimmings Limited, which company had
been declared insolvent and was being wound up, he has, during the year
preceding the winding up order of the company, committed the following
indictable offence, to wit: â€œActing in his capacity of president and general
manager, with intent to defraud, he did destroy, alter, mutilate and/or falsify
the books, papers, writings, valuable securities and documents belonging to the
Rayon Trimmings Limited, and/or concur in the same being done.â€ This is an
offence against subsection (a) of section 415Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ . The
accused had also been found guilty of an offence under section 417Â  of the
Criminal CodeÂ , but his appeal was unanimously allowed on this last conviction
by the appellate court. The Crown contended that the appeal to this Court
should be dismissed, because the judgment of the appellate court was not
rendered in accordance with section 1013Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ  as amended. In
1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14, subsection (6) was added to 1013 of the
Criminal CodeÂ  reading as follows: â€œWhenever an appeal under this section is
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and any judge of such Court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Court, the formal judgment of the
Court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.â€

The formal judgment of the appellate court
did not specify the grounds in law on which the Honourable Judge Howard was
dissenting: it merely stated that Howard J. was dissenting.

On the appeal to this Court, it was held that
the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain the appellantâ€™s
appeal. On the merits of the appeal this Court held that there was evidence on
which it could well be found that the appellant was guilty.

Lucien Gendron K.C. and Moses Doctor for
the appellant.

GÃ©rald Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment follows:

The Court:â€”The appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of section
415Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ .

[Page 696]

Upon appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the
majority of the Court of Kingâ€™s Bench, but Mr. Justice Howard dissented. In the
formal judgment of the Court, the dissent is merely referred to as follows:

This is the judgment of this Court, Mr. Justice
Howard dissenting.

Under a recent amendment (sec. 14 of s. 28 of
21-22 Geo. V), the following subsection was added to section 1013Â  of the
Criminal CodeÂ :

(6) Whenever an appeal under this section
is dismissed by the Court of Appeal and any judge of such court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the
court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.

In this case, the formal judgment does not
specify the grounds on which the dissent of Mr. Justice Howard is based, and
the Attorney-General, invoking former judgments of this Court (Davis v. The
King)[1]; Gouin
v. The King[2], and De
Bortoliv. The King[3]),
contends that, owing to the failure so to specify the grounds of dissent, an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.

We are of opinion that such contention cannot be
up-held. The only section of the Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023. It gives to

any person convicted of any indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section
1013Â  (the right of appealing) against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The fact that there has been dissent on a
question of law is therefore the only requirement.

In the Davis case1 and in
the others referred to by the Crown, upon the state of the law as it then was,
no dissenting judgment could be legally pronounced, unless the court of appeal
directed to the contrary, and unless the direction was plainly â€œevidenced by
the order of the Courtâ€ (Gouin v. The King[4]); and this Court held that dissenting
opinions expressed contrary to the prohibition of the statute should be treated
as non-existentâ€”the consequence being that there was to be found, in the
record, no dissent as a result of which the right of appeal could operate under
section 1023 of the Code.

     REGINA v BRADLEY JOHN McKENDRICK 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 16 October 1997. On that occasion the applicant was sentenced, having been convicted by his Honour after a trial without jury, to a total term of two years and eight months penal servitude comprising a minimum term component of two years specified to commence on 19 September 1997 and to expire on 18 September 1999. The sole matter raised for deliberation on behalf of the applicant is the question of parity with sentences received by co-offenders and one co-offender in particular.  2 The offence in respect of which the applicant was an accessory before the fact was a robbery which took place upon a public street when a female employee of a Mobil service station and convenience store was on the way to the bank with a little under $5,000 takings. The victim was an employee of such an establishment at Ashfield and the applicant was the manager of a similar facility at Burwood; hence, he was able to give information as to the likely amount of money that was being taken to the bank, the address of the bank, the expected times of arrival and other information which would enable the crime to be carried out.3 The crime was, in fact, carried out by a man called Sljivar. Two other participants were a man called Shaitly and a woman called Thompson. For present purposes one can ignore the participation of Thompson who was, in fact, charged as an accessory after the fact. Shaitly was also charged, like the applicant, with being an accessory before the fact.4 The three co-offenders were variously dealt with before Graham DCJ. Grogan DCJ was advised of the outcome of the proceedings concerning them. He came to the conclusion, which he expressed, that the question of parity did not arise. By that I understood his Honour to be saying he did not feel questions of parity obliged him to make any particular reference for quantifying his sentence, to what had been received by the co-offenders.5 There were undoubted differences between the applicant and Sljivar and Shaitly. Both of the latter pleaded guilty. Sljivar gave assistance to the extent of giving evidence in the case against the applicant. Shaitly was said to be entitled not only to a discount of appropriate sentence for his plea of guilty but also for matters taken into account pursuant to s 442B of the Crimes Act. It would appear that whatever was the focus of the matters taken into account under that provision, they had been raised in other proceedings in the District Court but the sentencing Judge dealing with his offence of accessory before the fact to robbery came to the conclusion that there was a continuing benefit to authority which ought to be reflected. Accordingly, I would comment that it is easy to see how Grogan DCJ came to the conclusion that the matter of parity could be put to one side, as it were.6 We have, however, today been taken to the record, in particular, of the offender Shaitly. It should be commented that the applicant had no significant past record, whereas Shaitly, in particular, had a considerable record and at about the time of the current offence was directly before courts for matters of some seriousness. It is unnecessary to recapitulate all the details of Shaitly's forensic excursions. It was submitted by counsel that analysis showed that Shaitly, in fact, served but four months and eight days specifically referrable to his participation in this offence. 7 Mr Dawe of Queen's Counsel for the Crown very fairly has indicated to the Court that he cannot dispute the arithmetic which leads to that conclusion and he has acknowledged that if it be the fact that Shaitly has served but four months and eight days in reference to his participation, then the contrast between that and the term of two years and eight months imposed upon the applicant, including the minimum term component of two years, would be likely to provoke intervention by this Court.8 The issue of parity is governed by well-known authority, including The Queen v Lowe and the recent judgments in the High Court in The Queen v Postiglione. It is unnecessary for present purposes to engage in an analysis of either of those cases. 9 In my view it is apparent that although the participation in the offence of the applicant and Shaitly were different and although Shaitly was entitled to discounts for the reasons which I have mentioned, the yawning gap between the sentence he has been required to serve and that required to be served by Shaitly is such that it should be concluded that the applicant is entitled to harbour a justified sense of grievance by reason of the lenience which was received by Shaitly. Therefore, in my view this Court ought intervene. It will be observed that the minimum term element of the applicant's sentence has less than six months to run. At the outset of proceedings, inquiry was made as to why there had been such a long delay in this matter coming before the Court and we were informed that the delay was as a consequence of the inability to obtain necessary transcript from courts below. It is common ground that the significant delay does not result from any action by the applicant. 10 The minimum term to serve under the current sentence has been served to the extent of in excess of 18 months. Although I regard the participation of the applicant, in effect, targeting a fellow employee for robbery on her way to the bank, as a matter requiring significant punishment I am unable to conclude that as a matter of parity the applicant should serve by way of minimum term any longer than he has already served. 11 For the reasons that I have sketched I have come to the conclusion that the following order should be made:-12 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted.13 The appeal be allowed.14 The sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of two years penal servitude to consist of a minimum term of 18 months commencing on 19 September 1997 and expiring on 18 March 1999.15 I would direct that the applicant be released to parole with effect from 18 March 1999 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 16 BELL J: I agree.17 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I proposed.

3029864,R v Hejabian [2016] NSWSC 1692,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN AJ: The accused, Shahram Hejabian, has been found guilty of the murder of Nouha Salame between 18 and 21 April 2014 at Doonside. He stands for sentence for that offence. At some time between those dates he killed Ms Salame, with whom he had been in relationship, and attempted to kill himself. In the manner in which the trial was conducted, the only issue was whether he had available to him the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. To understand this event, it is necessary to sketch some background.
	
	
	The accused was born in Iran on 5 July 1976. Accordingly, he was 37 years old at the time of the offence and is now 40. He was of the Bahai faith, and from his youth in Iran he suffered discrimination, abuse and violence because of his religion. He married in Iran but, as a result of this persecution, he and his wife took refuge in Turkey. He was then in his early twenties. They remained in that country until travelling to Australia in 2001, he being accepted as a refugee.
	
	
	He and his wife had a son but, within months of arriving in Australia, they separated. They were divorced in 2004. It seems that life was not easy for him during this period. He was prevented from seeing his son, and he perceived difficulties in obtaining accommodation and social security benefits. He felt that he had received no help and support here, despite his refugee status. Notwithstanding his fears about life in Iran, he returned to that country.
	
	
	There he remarried. In 2005 he and his second wife returned to Australia, where his family had also settled. Unfortunately, his second wife suffered from schizophrenia. She was given to episodes of self-harm and spent periods in hospital for psychiatric treatment. He decided that he should look after her as she was his wife and was dependent upon him. He became her carer. All this caused him considerable, ongoing stress. From 2011, he underwent psychological and psychiatric treatment, having been diagnosed with long standing post traumatic stress disorder and depression. It would appear that these conditions had their origin in his experience of persecution in Iran, but were maintained and heightened by the effects upon him of his wifeâ€™s mental illness.
	
	
	It was in or about 2010 that the accused met Ms Salame, the deceased, and a relationship between them developed. However, they did not live together. At the time of the murder she was living at Mt Druitt and he at Doonside. He had been living at that address with his second wife but from time to time she was absent during periods of hospitalisation. Some months before the murder, she had been placed permanently in a mental health facility.
	
	
	At the trial, relatives and friends of the deceased, and the brother of the accused, gave evidence of their observations of his relationship with her. As one might expect, those observations varied but what emerged from that evidence, for the most part, was a troubled relationship. The accused himself gave various accounts of the relationship to health professionals with whom he came into contact after his arrest. This included two forensic psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Richard Furst, who gave evidence on the issue of substantial impairment. There were significant inconsistencies in those accounts, but I do not find it necessary to examine them for present purposes.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the accused became very emotionally dependent upon the deceased and, as the Crown Prosecutor put it in submissions on sentence, saw her as his saviour in a future which otherwise appeared devoid of hope. He wanted her to marry him but, no doubt understandably, that was not a course to which she was prepared to commit herself. The deceasedâ€™s eldest daughter, Sarah Salame, described his behaviour in the weeks leading up to the murder as â€œobsessiveâ€. He would call the deceased on her mobile phone â€œmultiple timesâ€, and arrive at her home unannounced. The deceased was not happy about this because, whilst Sarah was aware of the relationship, her younger siblings were not.
	
	
	Also some months before the murder, he told the deceased that if she left him, he would kill her and himself. It seems that she did not take this seriously, and the Crown Prosecutor did not rely upon it as evidence that the murder was premeditated. Nevertheless, it is an indication of the intensity of his feelings for the deceased and the extent of his emotional dependence upon her.
	
	
	The deceased was killed some time between the afternoon of 19 April 2014, when she spoke to a friend on the phone, and the evening of 21 April 2014, when police gained entry to the home at Doonside and found the body of the deceased in the hallway and the accused, barely conscious, in a bedroom. It may well have occurred later on 19 April, but that cannot be firmly established by the evidence. The accused also gave accounts of what happened to health professionals and to Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, which are inconsistent and much of which I do not accept. Whether these accounts were deliberate falsehoods or the result of impaired memory, or both, I find unnecessary to decide. His counsel, Mr Austin, did not rely upon any of those accounts but, rather, on observations at the crime scene which included, importantly, some writing on a wall which amounted to a suicide note.
	
	
	Dr Kendall Bailey conducted an autopsy on the deceased. She noted two lacerations on her scalp, under one of which there were two skull fractures. The nature of the lacerations conveyed that they had been caused by an implement like a hammer. She also noted abrasions on her neck and face and petechial haemorrhages in her eyes and on the skin around the eyes. She saw these injuries as the result of compression of the neck. She thought it unlikely that the head injuries alone would have caused death, and concluded that it was the result of the combined effects of those injuries and neck compression.
	
	
	Observation of the brain disclosed signs that there had been some deprivation of oxygen, which could cause asphyxia. Dr Bailey could not say whether the neck compression produced death or merely an altered level of consciousness, but she saw it as a contributing factor. She said that the deceased may have been unconscious from a combination of the head injuries and neck compression, and then been unable to protect her airway, leading to asphyxia.
	
	
	The deceased was found lying on her back and Dr Bailey considered the possibility that, in an unconscious state, her tongue had blocked her airway. She agreed that the airway could be blocked in that manner, but the effect of her evidence was that in the present case that would not have caused asphyxiation in the absence of neck compression. It could not explain the facial and neck abrasions and, in particular, the petechial haemorrhages.
	
	
	Evidence was also given by Dr Peter Ellis, a forensic pathologist, who had been supplied with Dr Baileyâ€™s report and the crime scene evidence. Put shortly, he was of the view that the head injuries would have been sufficient of themselves to cause death. He doubted that any neck compression would have contributed to the death, as there was no injury to the underlying tissues or structures of the neck. He saw Dr Baileyâ€™s observations as â€œvery supportiveâ€ of asphyxia, but thought it more likely that it was the result of some obstruction to breathing â€œby interference with maybe the nose and mouth, in some form of suffocation.â€ He shared Dr Baileyâ€™s view that the deceased would be unlikely to have asphyxiated simply by her tongue falling back and blocking her airway. He saw the petechial haemorrhages as â€œmore indicative of a more active interference with breathing.â€
	
	
	The significance of this evidence is its bearing upon whether the accused intended to kill the deceased rather than to cause her grievous bodily harm. Mr Austin submitted that I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceasedâ€™s asphyxiation was the result of a deliberate act of the accused. In my view, however, the expert evidence admits of no other conclusion. I am satisfied that, apart from the blows to the deceasedâ€™s head, the accused did an act leading to her asphyxiation. The conclusion that he intended to kill her is inescapable.
	
	
	This is not to say that the killing was planned. A consistent thread in the various accounts of the accused was that he and the deceased had a heated argument. I accept that that was the case and, whatever its precise terms might have been, it was directed to his perception of their failing relationship. As I have said, on the wall of the bedroom in which the accused was found was writing by him in Persian. A Persian interpreter gave evidence of her translation of that writing. There was no punctuation in it, but she supplied some punctuation in the translation so as to make it more readily understood.
	
	
	The message began with the accusedâ€™s complaints about his treatment in Australia, and referred to the breakdown of his relationship with his first wife and the difficulties of coping with the mental illness of his second wife. Relevantly, it continued:
	


Within this time I met this lady. It is about 4 years that we have a relationship. We have even had sex. Within these 4 years this lady has made me many promises that she will make me a happy man. I am an emotional and weak person. From feelings point of view this lady has broken my heart. Within this period she kept changing her words. She would say I love you but she did not. She used me in every ways. She always lied to her children and first husband. When she was speaking with them on the phone she always lied. She said she would marry me. I said okay. Whatever she said I said okay because I really love her. But she always played with my feelings. She put so much emotional pressure on me. She caused me much torment. She left me a year ago. No matter how much I begged her she didnâ€™t have mercy on me. I fell into a sick bed for 3 months. I had much stress and anxiety and fear of everything in this prostitute bearing country. Forgive me for having written this but the reality is that one disaster happened to me that was due to severe stress. I do not know what else to say.


	
	The underlined words and figures in that passage are as they appeared in the writing on the wall. The message continued by expressing the accusedâ€™s desire that his mother be told not to be sad for him, and an assertion that he loved his family. It ended with the word â€œFarewellâ€. Insofar as that passage suggests that the deceased behaved deceitfully, or set out to cause the accused emotional distress, I have no reason to believe that that was so. I do, however, accept that that was his perception.
	
	
	As I have said, the accused was found in the bedroom barely conscious. He had a number of pressure sores on the right side of his body, conveying that he had been lying on the floor on that side for a lengthy period. Ambulance officers conveyed him to Westmead Hospital.
	
	
	Pharmacological evidence established that he had taken a significant overdose of Mirtazapine tablets, which he had been prescribed for his depression, and a substantial overdose of Clozapine tablets, an anti-psychotic drug which would have been prescribed for his wife. Medical evidence established that he was likely to have become unconscious following his ingestion of this medication and that he had been lying in the same position long enough to have contracted a condition known as Rhabdomyolysis. This arises from muscle damage, causing the release of a particular protein which, in turn, causes kidney failure. Eventually, if untreated, it can be fatal. It has left the accused with enduring problems with mobility, requiring the use of a wheelchair.
	
	
	Clearly, this was a serious suicide attempt on the part of the accused. The Crown Prosecutor accepted as much.
	
	
	By reference to the terms of s 23A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the defence of substantial impairment was presented on the basis that at the relevant time the accusedâ€™s ability to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, that impairment being so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. As to the underlying condition, both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt reviewed the history which I have outlined and records of the accusedâ€™s psychiatric and psychological treatment, both before the murder and at Westmead Hospital and in custody after his arrest. Both psychiatrists diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and were of the view that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the relevant time.
	
	
	Whether that amounted to an impairment sufficient to warrant the reduction of murder to manslaughter was a matter which they properly left to the decision of the jury. In my view, it was probably upon that issue, involving the application of community standards, that the defence failed.
	
	
	However that may be, I am satisfied that the accused had lost self control at the time he killed the deceased and that his mental illness was a significant factor contributing to his conduct. This was an uncharacteristic episode of serious violence, there being no evidence of any other violence on his part during the relationship. As Dr Furst observed, his state of mind is best divined from the message he wrote on the wall and his serious attempt to end his own life. Accordingly, in the light of a long line of authority on this issue, his moral culpability for his actions is reduced and the need for his sentence to reflect the consideration of general deterrence is moderated. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the principles emerging from those cases dealing with the bearing of mental illness on sentence are applicable here.
	
	
	That said, the offence remains a serious one of its kind and, while taking into account the accusedâ€™s mental illness, the sentence I pass must reflect an appropriate measure of denunciation and deterrence. The crime of murder carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. It is not suggested that the present case falls into the worst category calling for the imposition of the maximum sentence, and the accusedâ€™s background, the circumstances of the offence as I have found them, and his otherwise favourable subjective case to which I shall refer, justify a significant departure from the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	I received a victim impact statement from the deceasedâ€™s daughter, Sarah Salame, which she read to the court. That was no easy task but, notwithstanding her obvious distress, she did so with courage. The statement expressed eloquently the outrage and grief of herself, her siblings and her extended family, and the enduring effects upon all of them of this tragic event. I expressed my deepest sympathy to Ms Salame and her family members at the sentence hearing, and I do so again now. I have regard to that statement in accordance with prevailing authority.
	
	
	The accused has a brief criminal history. In 2002 he was convicted and placed on bonds for offences of common assault and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, those offences relating to his first wife. I have no details of the offences but, while the common assault suggests an episode of domestic violence, I place little significance on them given their age and the lenient outcome. In 2013 he was again convicted and placed on a bond for offences of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16. I place little significance upon those offences also, but regard must be had to the fact that he was subject to that bond at the time of the murder.
	
	
	The accused will require ongoing treatment for his mental illness while in custody, and I take into account the fact that that mental illness, together with his physical disability arising from his suicide attempt, will make his time in custody more difficult. As I have said, there was no history of violence in his relationship with the deceased prior to the murder and I consider that, with appropriate treatment and supervision, his prospects of rehabilitation are favourable. As I have said, I expect that he will continue to undergo treatment while in custody and, no doubt, it is important that a treatment plan be developed and maintained upon his release. With those safeguards in place, I think it unlikely that he would re-offend in this way.
	
	
	Mr Austin submitted that I should find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. However, the sentence I impose must be lengthy and, in my view, the period of parole eligibility afforded by the statutory proportion would be sufficient to foster the accusedâ€™s rehabilitation through supervision and the continuing sanction of parole.
	
	
	Taking all these factors into account, I have decided that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 21 years. Applying the statutory proportion, the non-parole period is 15 years and 9 months. As I have said, the accused was conveyed to Westmead Hospital on 21 April 2014 and, although he was not formally arrested until two days later, he has been effectively in custody since that date. Accordingly, the sentence will date from 21 April 2014.
	
	
	Shahram Hejabian, for the murder of Nouha Salame you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months, commencing on 21 April 2014 and expiring on 20 January 2030, and a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months, commencing on 21 January 2030 and expiring on 20 April 2035. You will be eligible for release on parole on 21 January 2030.

ORDER

            
               Application for special leave to appeal granted.
               Appeal dismissed.
            
         

   
      
         

Cur. adv. vult.

         


               
The Court delivered the following written judgment:â€”



               Aug. 18
               Mason C.J., Wilson, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ.
               
The applicant was convicted upon one count of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. He was indicted alone, three of his alleged co-conspirators having been tried and convicted in other proceedings. The case against the applicant was that he had knowingly participated in a scheme to evade the payment of income tax. Speaking in the broadest of terms, the scheme involved the acquisition of target companies with profits for the current financial year at a price which did not reflect the contingent tax liability in respect of those profits. Upon this transaction the vendor shareholders paid a fee. The companies were then stripped of their profits and ""dumped"" by steps which passed ownership and control to straw persons. The result was that the companies could not, and did not, meet their liability to pay tax.
               
At his trial the applicant admitted the existence of a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. There was no contest that a scheme of the type described above had been devised and carried out by persons alleged to be the applicant's co-conspirators, nor was there any contest that the applicant, who was an accountant, had introduced clients whose companies had been used in the scheme. There was evidence that the applicant had in relation to those companies taken part in various activities which were part of the scheme and had shared in the fee which was paid by vendor shareholders. The applicant's defence was that what he did formed no part of any scheme to engage in fraudulent conduct. His case was that at all times he believed that the companies in question would be ""treated"" rather than ""dumped"", that is to say, that they would be dealt with in a manner designed to avoid or reduce the liability to pay tax on the income which had been already earned, rather than stripped of their assets to prevent the effective collection of the tax for which they remained liable. The prosecution, on the other hand, contended that the inference to be drawn from his activities was that the applicant knew that the companies with which he was concerned were to be ""dumped"" and that he participated knowingly in the conspiracy to defraud.
               
The sole point that was argued before us arises from a direction given to the jury by the trial judge in his summing up. His Honour directed the jury to have regard first of all only to the evidence ""directly admissible"" against the applicant, that is to say, the evidence of his own acts and declarations, any acts or declarations of others which he adopted or what others did at his direction. The purpose of looking at this evidence alone was, according to the judge's direction, to determine whether there was a prima facie case that the applicant was a party to the conspiracy. If the jury were satisfied that there was prima facie proof of the applicant's participation, so the charge continued, they might then look at all the evidence, including the acts and declarations of the other conspirators, for the purpose of determining the nature and extent of the underlying agreement and for the purpose of deciding the ultimate issue of the applicant's ""guilty participation"". It is this direction which was said by the applicant to have been erroneous.
               
An appropriate starting point from which to consider the use which might be made of the acts and declarations of one co-conspirator against another is the rule of thumb referred to in Tripodi v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
  . There it was said to be an ""empirical but practical and convenient test"" that acts and declarations done or made outside the presence of an accused are not admissible against him. Practical and convenient though that test might be, it can be no more than a rule of thumb, because it is clear that it has a limited application. It represents an attempt to state in practical terms the effect of the hearsay rule although, of course, acts (other than certain acts of communication) cannot of themselves constitute hearsay and, strictly speaking, lie outside the rule. However, acts may contain an implied assertion on the part of the actor which makes it appropriate to treat evidence of those acts for some purposes as the equivalent of hearsay. A conspirator may, in the absence of another person alleged to be a co-conspirator, say or do something carrying with it the implication that the other person is involved. The statement or the act may be admissible in evidence to prove the fact of a conspiracy and, by way of admission, the participation of the maker of the statement or the actor in that conspiracy. But evidence of neither the statement nor the act should, except in the circumstances which we shall elaborate presently, be admitted against the other person to prove his participation because it would for this purpose be hearsay or the equivalent of hearsay.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R. 1, at p. 7.


               
In conspiracy cases a clear distinction is to be made between the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of each of the alleged conspirators in it. Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means and it is the fact of the agreement, or combination, to engage in a common enterprise which is the nub of the offence. This fact can seldom be proved by direct evidence of the making of an agreement and must in almost all cases be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay and is not dependent upon some circumstance to take it outside the hearsay rule, such as an implied authority making the acts and words of one the acts and words of the other.
               
Thus it was said in Tripodi 
                  
    [2]
   that proof of the crime of conspiracy ""may well consist in evidence of the separate acts of the individuals charged which, although separate acts, yet point to a common design and when considered in combination justify the conclusion that there must have been a combination such as that alleged in the indictment"". For example, it may be possible in a case of conspiracy to commit armed robbery to conclude from the fact that one accused wearing a disguise was present in a bank at the same time as another accused, similarly disguised, was waiting outside the bank in a motor vehicle with the motor running, that both were engaged in a common enterprise to rob the bank. For the purpose of reaching that conclusion it is permissible to use the acts and declarations of each, even in the absence of the other, not as proof of the truth of any assertion or implied assertion of the participation of the other, but as facts from which the combination might be inferred. Utterances for this purpose may be regarded as facts no less than acts and, indeed, in the United States are sometimes called verbal acts. In the example given it would be possible to reach the conclusion, admitting the evidence for the purpose described and considering it against each accused separately, not only that there was a conspiracy but also that each of the two accused was a participant. It was such a situation that Isaacs J. had in mind in R. and Attorney-General (Cth) v. Associated Northern Collieries (""the Coal-Vend Case"") 
    [3]
   when he pointed out that both the fact of combination and the participation of the participants may be proved by the same evidence. He said 
    [4]
  :
                      though primarily each set of acts is attributable to the person whose acts they are, and to him alone, there may be such a concurrence of time, character, direction and result as naturally to lead to the inference that these separate acts were the outcome of pre-concert, or some mutual contemporaneous engagement, or that they were themselves the manifestations of mutual consent to carry out a common purpose, thus forming as well as evidencing a combination to effect the one object towards which the separate acts are found to converge.
               




                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 6.

                         (1911) 14 C.L.R. 387.

                         (1911) 14 C.L.R., at p. 400.


               
However, it is not in all cases that evidence of the separate acts of the alleged conspirators will prove both the fact of combination and their participation. Of course, if the evidence fails to prove a combination at all then that is an end of the matter. But if it proves a combination, although not the participation of an individual alleged to be a conspirator, then the question arises whether there are circumstances in which evidence of the acts and declarations of other participants, outside the presence of the individual, may be led against him, not as separate facts from which, when combined with other facts, an inference of combination may be drawn, but as evidence of his own participation. Evidence of the acts or declarations of others led for this purpose will be led to prove the truth of the assertion or implied assertion contained in those acts or declarations. It would be excluded as hearsay or its equivalent were it not admissible upon some other basis.
               
That basis is provided in an appropriate case by the rule which states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others: Tripodi 
                  
    [5]
  . Thus anything said or done by one conspirator in pursuit of the common object may be treated as having been said or done on behalf of another conspirator. That being so, once participation in the conspiracy is established, such evidence may prove the nature and extent of the participation. The principle lying behind the rule is one of agency and the closest analogy is with partners in a partnership business. Indeed, conspirators have been described as partners in crime. The principle of agency has a particular application in cases of conspiracy where preconcert is the essence of the crime.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 7.


               
The implied authority on the part of one conspirator to act or speak on behalf of another will only arise if the latter is part of the combination. Evidence of the acts or declarations of the former may, however, be led to prove that very fact. That is where the dilemma lies in cases of conspiracy because, to assume the participation of the latter in order to admit the evidence on the basis of implied authority is to assume the very fact which is sought to be proved by that evidence. If there were no prerequisite to the admission of such evidence ""hearsay would lift itself by its own bootstraps to the level of competent evidence"": Glasser v. United States
                  
    [6]
  . In that case, Glasser, who was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, had red hair. Evidence was led of a declaration by an alleged co-conspirator in the absence of Glasser that ""he would have to see ""Red"", or send the money over to the ""redhead"", etc., in connexion with ""fixing"" cases""
                  
    [7]
  . In accordance with accepted principle, such evidence was held to be admissible ""only if there is proof aliunde that he is connected with the conspiracy""
                  
    [8]
  . That, of course, still leaves two questions. The first is the degree or standard of proof of the evidence from another source which is required. The second is whether it is for the trial judge or the jury to decide whether proof of the required standard exists.



                         (1942) 315 U.S. 60, at p. 75.

                         (1942) 315 U.S., at p. 73.

                         (1942) 315 U.S., at p. 74.


               
Turning to the first question, if it is proof beyond reasonable doubt which is required, then the evidence of acts and declarations of co-conspirators led to prove the participation of an individual in the combination would be of no value in proving that fact. At most its relevance would be to show the nature and extent of the participation, once the actual participation had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. This was recognized by Street C.J. in R. v. Gunn and Howden
                  
    [9]
   where he said:In point of fact if the agreement or common purpose, which is the gist of the offence, could be proved aliunde the acts or declarations of the different parties in pursuance of the common purpose would not be required to be proved. In practice however, as is pointed out, they are almost universally put forward for the purpose of proving the conspiracy itself, and this case was no exception to that practice.
               




                         (1930) 30 S.R.(N.S.W.) 336, at p. 343.


               
Street C.J. had also said 
    [10]
  :It is laid down by the authorities that the fact of a conspiracy must be established, prima facie at least, before the acts and declarations of one can be used in evidence against the others, but this would in most cases lead to such insuperable difficulties that in practice the rule is disregarded and for the purpose of proving the conspiracy evidence is admitted of acts done by the alleged conspirators.These two passages appear not to recognize that in seeking to prove the participation of an alleged conspirator by attributing his authority to the incriminating acts or declarations of the others, it is sought to use the evidence in a manner different from that in which it may be used to establish the combination as a matter of inference. A similar attitude seems to be taken in Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed. (1963), p. 124, par. 263 where the author says that ""[o]n charges of conspiracy, the acts and declarations of each conspirator in furtherance of the common object are admissible against the rest; and it is immaterial whether the existence of the conspiracy, or the participation of the defendants be proved first, though either element is nugatory without the other"". Such statements fail to recognize the problem.

Often the problem will not arise in any practical way because the acts and declarations of the conspirators considered separately will establish both the fact of the combination and the participation of each of them. But that is not always the case. Nor is the problem overcome when it does arise merely by treating the evidence establishing the existence of a combination separately from the evidence of the participation of an individual in the combination. Of course, the case against each alleged conspirator must be established separately and this ultimately requires those two elements to be kept distinct. Sometimes, particularly where the existence of evidence of an individual's participation is crucial, this may dictate the order of proof. As was said in The Queen's Case
                  
    [11]
  : ""On a prosecution for a crime to be proved by conspiracy, general evidence of an existing conspiracy may in the first instance be received, as a preliminary step to that more particular evidence, by which it is to be shewn that the individual Defendants were guilty participators in such conspiracy."" But it may not be necessary or possible in many cases to call the evidence in two stages and that, apparently, is what the author of Phipson on Evidence had in mind in the passage which we have cited above.



                         (1820) 2 Brod. & B. 284, at p. 310 [129 E.R. 976, at p. 986].


               
In Reg. v. Finn and Niblock
                  
    [12]
   McPherson J., speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Queensland, referred to the passage from Phipson  and said:But that means no more than that evidence of the acts of others may be admitted to prove the existence and nature of the agreement before proof is adduced for the purpose of establishing that the accused was a party to the agreement However, when it comes to proving that a particular accused was a party to the agreement â€” that he participated in the conspiracy â€” the acts of other persons may not be relied upon. The accused must be connected with the conspiracy by evidence admissible against him according to ordinary principles of the law of evidence  Participation by the accused in the alleged conspiracy can therefore be established only by evidence of his own acts or admissions and not by the acts or admissions of others, except to the extent that they are shown to have been authorized or adopted by the accused himself. Until such participation is established, the acts of others are available only to show the existence of an agreement and its nature or terms.As we read that passage, McPherson J. was expressing the view that the participation of an individual in a conspiracy cannot be proved by evidence of things said or done by other conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy unless that participation is first proved beyond reasonable doubt by other evidence. Such a view is understandable, particularly when it is borne in mind, as it should be, that the other conspirators, whose acts and declarations in the absence of the individual are sought to be used in evidence, may not be available for cross-examination by the individual. It is a view, however, which deprives the evidence of any probative effect, other than with respect to the nature and extent of the conspiracy, by requiring as a prerequisite of its use, proof of the very thing which it is led to prove, namely, that the accused was guilty of conspiracy. The need to cut this Gordian knot has been generally recognized, although there has been no general recognition of the point at which it should be cut.



                         [1985] 1 Qd R. 212, at pp. 215-216.


               
In R. v. Orton
                  
    [13]
  , a case of conspiracy, Cussen J. charged the jury that ""Each accused is entitled at the outset to have the evidence properly admissible against him considered alone, and it is only when after such evidence so considered you find him to be a party to the conspiracy, if any, that the acts of the other conspirators can be used against him""
                  
    [14]
  . This appears to require proof beyond reasonable doubt of participation before the acts and declarations of others in the absence of the particular accused may be used against him, but in Reg. v. Minuzzo and Williams
                  
    [15]
  , Young C.J. (with whom King J. agreed) doubted whether, upon a consideration of the whole of the charge, Cussen J. intended to convey to the jury that it was only after they had concluded that any alleged conspirator was guilty that they could use the evidence of the acts of the other conspirators against him. In Minuzzo and Williams itself, the Victorian Full Court held that evidence of the acts and declarations of the other accused might be used to prove the participation of an individual accused once there was prima facie evidence from another source of the individual accused's participation in the combination.

                         [1984] V.R. 417, at p. 429.


               
The term ""prima facie grounds"" was used by Stephen in Art. 4 of his Digest of the Law of Evidence (1876) where he said  at p. 6:
                  When two or more persons conspire together to commit any offence or actionable wrong, everything said, done, or written by any one of them in the execution or furtherance of their common purpose, is deemed to be so said, done, or written by every one, and is a relevant fact as against each of them  Evidence of acts relevant under this article may not be given until the judge is satisfied that, apart from them, there are primÃ¢ facie grounds for believing in the existence of the conspiracy.In The Indian Evidence Act 1872, which was drafted by Stephen and upon which his Digest  was based, s. 10 provides:Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done, or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.See Mirza Akbar v. King-Emperor
                  
    [16]
  . Whether Stephen drew any distinction in this context between ""prima facie grounds"" and ""reasonable ground to believe"", the latter phrase is reflected in the judgment of this Court in Tripodi 
                  
    [17]
   where it said:When the case for the prosecution is that in the commission of the crime a number of men acted in preconcert, reasonable evidence of the preconcert must be adduced before evidence of acts or words of one of the parties in furtherance of the common purpose which constitutes or forms an element of the crime becomes admissible against the other or others, that is to say of course, unless some other ground for admitting the evidence exists in the given case.

                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 7.


               
In Tripodi  the Court was speaking of the admission in evidence of the acts and declarations of others outside the presence of the accused in proof of larceny rather than conspiracy, but, as we have said, the principle upon which such evidence is admitted extends beyond cases of conspiracy. The significant distinction between conspiracy and other offences for present purposes is that indicated in Tripodi 
                  
    [18]
  , namely, that on a charge of conspiracy combination is also an element in the offence and not merely a ground for the admission of the evidence. The question does not, therefore, arise in cases other than conspiracy of the use of evidence of the acts and declarations of others to prove the combination except as evidence of separate acts from which a combination might be inferred. Once there is reasonable ground for inferring a combination in cases other than conspiracy, acts and declarations of the participants in furtherance of the common purpose may be used to prove, not the fact of participation in the combination, but the offence charged.



                         (1961) 104 C.L.R., at p. 6.


               
In the United States, varying standards have been applied to the proof of the participation of an alleged individual conspirator which is required to open the way for the use against him of the acts and declarations of others. They include ""substantial independent evidence"", ""a prima facie case"" and ""proof of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence"": see Marcus, Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases (1987), pp. 5-60, 5-62. In Canada the requirement is that ""a probability is raised that he [the individual accused] was a member of the conspiracy"": Reg. v. Carter
                  
    [19]
  . In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal, adopting Tripodi,  laid down a test of reasonable evidence of common intention, that is to say, of the participation of the individual: Reg. v. Humphries
                  
    [20]
  ; Reg. v. Buckton
                  
    [21]
  . It should be added that in the second of these two cases a majority took the view, for which Tripodi  is no authority, that reasonable evidence is the equivalent of proof on the balance of probabilities.



                         (1982) 137 D.L.R. (3d) 385; 
                         67 C.C.C. (2d) 568, at p. 575.

                         [1985] 2 N.Z.L.R. 257.


               
In our view, the test adopted in Tripodi  is the appropriate one. Where an accused is charged with conspiracy, evidence in the form of acts done or words uttered outside his presence by a person alleged to be a co-conspirator will only be admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy where it is established that there was a combination of the type alleged, that the acts were done or the words uttered by a participant in furtherance of its common purpose and there is reasonable evidence, apart from the acts or words, that the accused was also a participant. The words ""reasonable evidence"" have provided a standard which has been applied without difficulty in this country for some years, at least in cases where preconcert has been the basis upon which evidence has been led in cases other than conspiracy, and there is no reason to suppose that if it has provided an appropriate test in those cases, it will not do so where conspiracy is charged. If there is any difference between ""reasonable evidence"" and ""a prima facie case"", which in this context we very much doubt, then the words ""reasonable evidence"" are to be preferred providing, as they do, a test of admissibility for which no more precise expression is needed. The aim in limiting the use which might be made of a co-conspirator's acts or declarations is to exclude such evidence when its admission might operate unfairly against an accused. For this purpose, the element of discretion implicit in the term ""reasonable evidence"" is desirable.
               
The question remains whether the trial judge or the jury should ultimately determine the existence or otherwise of reasonable independent evidence of the participation of an alleged conspirator as a ground for the use against him of evidence of the acts and declarations of other conspirators which took place in his absence. Obviously the matter must be one for the determination of the trial judge in the first instance, for the evidence of acts and declarations ought not to be admitted at all for that purpose if no basis can be shown for its admission. But controversy exists over whether, even after the evidence has been admitted, the jury should be instructed that it is for them to determine whether there is reasonable independent evidence of participation and that if there is not, they ought not to use the evidence of the acts and declarations of the other conspirators for the purpose of deciding that issue.
               
In United States v. Dennis 
                  
    [22]
  , Judge Learned Hand expressed the view:The law is indeed not wholly clear as to who must decide whether such a declaration may be used; but we think that the better doctrine is that the judge is always to decide, as concededly he generally must, any issues of fact on which the competence of evidence depends, and that, if he decides it to be competent, he is to leave it to the jury to use like any other evidence, without instructing them to consider it as proof only after they too have decided a preliminary issue which alone makes it competent. Indeed, it is a practical impossibility for laymen, and for that matter for most judges, to keep their minds in the isolated compartments that this requires.One might add that the difficulty for a jury is exacerbated if the standard of proof upon which they are to decide the preliminary issue differs from the standard of proof upon which they are ultimately to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused. In Carbo v. United States 
                  
    [23]
   this difficulty was referred to:The jury is already concerned with the evidence-weighing standards involved in proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To expect them not only to compartmentalize the evidence, separating that produced by the declarations from all other, but as well to apply to the independent evidence the entirely different evidence-weighing standards required of a prima facie case, is to expect the impossible.In that case the court held that it was for the trial judge alone and not the jury to determine the admissibility of evidence of acts and declarations occurring outside the presence of an alleged conspirator. Thereafter, it was held, it was for the jury to determine whether the whole of the evidence, including the acts and declarations, established guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That appears to be the orthodox approach in the United States: see Marcus, op. cit., p. 5-70.

                         (1963) 314 F. 2d. 718, at p. 737.


               
In Canada the opposite approach is adopted. This appears from Reg. v. Carter
                  
    [24]
   where McIntyre J. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court said:In charging the jury on this question, the trial judge should instruct them to consider whether on all the evidence they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed. If they are not satisfied, then the accused charged with participation in the conspiracy must be acquitted. If, however, they conclude that a conspiracy as alleged did exist, they must then review the evidence and decide whether, on the basis of the evidence directly receivable against the accused, a probability is raised that he was a member of the conspiracy. If this conclusion is reached, they then become entitled to apply the hearsay exception and consider evidence of the acts and declarations performed and made by the co-conspirators in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy as evidence against the accused on the issue of his guilt. This evidence, taken with the other evidence, may be sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a member of the conspiracy and that he is accordingly guilty. They should be told, however, that this ultimate determination is for them alone and that the mere fact that they have found sufficient evidence directly admissible against the accused to enable them to consider his participation in the conspiracy probable, and to apply the hearsay exception, does not make a conviction automatic. They should be clearly told that it is only after they have become satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence on both issues, that is, the existence of the conspiracy and the accused's membership in it, that they may convict, and that it is open to them, if they think it right or if they are not satisfied, to acquit the accused, even after reaching their initial determination of probable membership in the conspiracy which enabled the application of the hearsay exception.We have set out this passage in full because it demonstrates, we think, the difficulty upon that approach in formulating a charge to the jury which could readily be applied, or even understood, by them. It is an approach which has been adopted in some States in Australia â€” e.g., in Victoria in Minuzzo and Williams
                  
    [25]
  â€” and it was adopted by the trial judge in the present case, but experience suggests nothing to allay the fear that it requires the jury to undertake a task which is incapable of explanation in terms which they can comprehend. Indeed, at the risk of repetition it is instructive to set out a passage from the judgment of Young C.J. in Minuzzo and Williams

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal lawâ€”Charge of rapeâ€”Evidenceâ€”Corroborationâ€”Charge to
juryâ€”Misdirectionâ€”New trial.

The appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario (81 C.C.C. 319) dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) appellantâ€™s appeal
from his conviction on a charge of rape. The issue at the trial was whether or
not the complainant voluntarily consented to the intercourse. A witness, R.,
who had arrived at the scene of the alleged offence shortly after what took
place, testified to there being a â€œmatted downâ€ area of about 20 x 6 feet. The
complainant in her evidence had said nothing about such condition. Appellant
testified that such condition existed before what took place. In charging the jury
the trial Judge said that the evidence of R. and two other men corroborated the
complainantâ€™s story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and he
followed by detailing certain matters of their evidence, including the
condition of the area as described by R.

Held (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The
conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.

Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: It was not
necessary that the complainant should have given some particular bit of
evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her
general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crownâ€™s case, it was
quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when R arrived, and
the jury would not be bound to believe appellantâ€™s evidence as to its condition
before the occurrence. But it was misdirection to say that evidence of the
matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute
corroboration of a material aspect of the complainantâ€™s story as to which she
had not testified. And it could not be said that the misdirection had caused no
miscarriage of justice.

Per Rand J.: It was beyond controversy on the evidence
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the complainantâ€™s story or to the case of the Crown.
The charge to the jury was, therefore, in that respect, a misdirection in law
and of such a nature that it could not be said that it might not have
influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The
reference in question in the charge to the condition of the area, having regard
to its context, related, not to any supposed statement of the complainant as to
the condition of the area which was corroborated by R., but to a reference
earlier in the charge to the complainantâ€™s evidence as to the nature of the
alleged assault, and would be so understood by the jury; and R.â€™s evidence as
to the condition of the area was consistent with, and could properly be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 135]

tive of, the complainantâ€™s evidence with respect to the
struggle alleged by her to have taken place, unless it were clearly established
as a matter of fact that the struggle described by her was of such a limited
character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent
described by R., and on that question the jury, if accepting complainantâ€™s
evidence that she did not consent and was attacked, and giving due weight to
the circumstances, might well have considered that no difficulty arose, and
that was a question of fact, expressly left as such to, and entirely one for,
the jury. There was really no question of law involved in the dissent in the
Court of Appeal, but merely matters of fact, and therefore the appeal should be
quashed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) the appellantâ€™s appeal from his
conviction, at trial before Greene J. and a jury, on a charge of rape.

H. Freshman for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.â€”The conviction of the appellant Mclntyre on a charge of
rape was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Laidlaw
dissenting. As I consider there should be a new trial, I refrain from
discussing the evidence except as it may be necessary to explain my reasons for
so doing.

If the offence occurred, there is no doubt that the appellant
committed it. He admits that he had intercourse with the complainant, Eva
Pettigrew, at the time and place mentioned by her but his defence is that she
consented voluntarily. The intercourse took place about noon on a bright
Sunday, May 23rd, 1943, not far from a travelled highway in the Township of Ancaster.
The exact spot is part of the abandoned right-of-way of an electric railway
company and is described in the evidence as being about twenty feet by six feet
in area. The ground surrounding it is filled with weeds and tall grass.

After the occurrence, Eva Pettigrew complained to one or more of
the occupants of a neighbouring farm house, one of whom described the condition
of the particular

[Page 136]

area immediately thereafter as â€œmatted downâ€. There would appear
to be no denial of this fact but, in view of the defence, the important
question in this connection was as to the condition of that area before the
complainant and accused had reached it. The only one who gave any evidence on
this question was the accused, who said it was â€œwell flattenedâ€ and â€œthe only
matted down spot in the whole territory.â€

The vital point in the whole case was as to whether the
complainant consented or, if she had consented, whether such consent had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 298). The
trial judge told the jury that they â€œshould be reluctant to convict in a case
of this kind upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainantâ€ but that â€œit
is within your power to do so.â€ He then dealt with the question â€œwhether the
story of the complainant had been corroborated in a material aspect.â€ He stated
that the evidence of three people in the farm house â€œamply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story.â€ He then detailed some of these aspects and stated, as one of
them:â€”â€œThey described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the
grass was pressed downâ€, and concluded:â€”â€œSo in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here
to-day.â€ Later in his charge he said:â€”â€œShe says that she did not consent, and
that she was overpowered by fear when he threatened her with bodily harm.
Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasionâ€”it is for you
gentlemen to sayâ€”there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of
some twenty feet by six.â€

It was pointed out in argument before us that the trial judge was
in error in stating that three occupants of the farm house had described the
condition of this lot where the grass was pressed down. As a matter of fact
only one had referred to it but, as we may deal only with the dissent in the
Court below, I disregard this discrepancy. All that was required was that the
corroboration should be of the evidence of the complainant that the accused had
carnal knowledge of her without her consent or with consent that had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm

[Page 137]

It was not necessary that the complainant should have testified
to some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that
point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of
the Crownâ€™s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular
area when the independent witnesses arrived, and the jury would not be bound to
believe the evidence of the accused as to its condition before the occurrence.

However, that is not what the trial judge told the jury. He
instructed them that the evidence could be taken by them as corroborating her
story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and then gave as one
aspect the condition of the area. As a matter of fact she had said nothing
about it. It was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition
of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material
aspect of the complainantâ€™s story as to which she had not testified. It is in
this sense that I understand Mr.Â Justice Laidlawâ€™s statement:â€”â€œThere could
not, of course, be corroboration, ample or otherwise, of evidence not given by
the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, and in my opinion there was a misdirection to
the jury in this matter.â€ In any event, later in his judgment he states:â€”â€œThere
was again [referring to the same point] misdirection of such a character and
magnitude as to make the trial unfair to the appellant.â€

In other parts of his charge, the trial judge had told the jury
that they were the sole judges as to what facts had been proved by the
evidence; that while it was his duty to review some of the highlights of the
evidence and to comment on them, if he saw fit, he could not pretend to review
everything and, if he expressed an opinion of the facts, they were not bound to
follow it unless their own opinion happened to be the same; and, towards the
conclusion of his charge, he stated that he did not pretend to have covered all
the evidence,â€”that there might be parts of it that were important that they
recalled which he had not gone over but that he was satisfied that among their
twelve joint memories they would have before them everything that was of any
real importance.

[Page 138]

These general observations, however, cannot weigh in this case
where the question of consent was of prime importance, nor does it matter that
the judge was right in pointing out other evidence which, if the jury believed
it, would warrant them in treating it as corroboration. There being
misdirection, I am unable to say that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
The fact that counsel for the accused did not object at the trial should not be
taken, in the circumstances, to indicate that the point was negligible. There
had already been one trial where the jury disagreed, and, considering the
evidence as a whole in the record before us and the importance attached to the
matted down area by the trial judge, the Crown has failed to convince me that
but for the misdirection the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Gouin
v. The King[2].

The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new
trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.â€”This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of rape. Appellant relies upon the dissenting judgment of Laidlaw J.A.
as establishing jurisdiction in this Court pursuant to the provisions of
section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The difference of opinion in the Court below was with regard to
certain portions of the charge of the learned trial judge. Laidlaw J.A. was of
opinion that there was material misdirection and that the Crown had not met the
onus thereby cast upon it of showing that there had been no miscarriage. The
Chief Justice of Ontario and Gillanders J.A. were of opinion that there was no
misdirection, the Chief Justice being further of the view that even if it could
be said that misdirection existed, it was quite improbable that it had had any
effect upon the result. The question in issue at the trial was as to whether or
not there had been consent on the part of the complainant, the defence being
that there had been such consent.

[Page 139]

In his charge, the learned trial judge said:

The evidence of the three gentlemen near by, the farmer Mr.
Robson, his father-in-law and his brother-in-law Scott, amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story. In other words, they painted the scene as she has told it to you.
They found the man naked. They told you how she arrived at the house with
nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described (the condition of the
area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters
they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness
box here to-day.

The complainant did not give any evidence with regard to the
condition of the area at any time. In the course of his judgment, Laidlaw J.A.,
after pointing this out, refers to the description given by complainant as to
her struggle with the appellant, and the evidence of the appellant that the
place in question was matted down at the time he and the complainant came
there. The ground of dissent was that Robsonâ€™s evidence could not amount to
corroboration of any evidence given by complainant either as to the condition
of the area or as to her struggle with the appellant, for the reason that she
had given no evidence as to the condition of the area and the extent of the
beaten down area described by Robson could not have been caused by the struggle
described by the complainant.

In considering whether or not there was misdirection in the
charge, the language of the learned trial judge is to be scrutinized to see
what the jury might reasonably be considered to have understood from it. It is,
of course, misdirection if a jury is directed to treat something as
corroboration which is not in law corroboration. In the present case, the
question is whether there is to be taken from what the learned trial judge told
the jury that the complainant had made some statement in evidence with regard
to the condition of the area which was corroborated by Robson, or whether his
charge is to be taken as referring only to her evidence as to her struggle, and
if the latter, then was the evidence of Robson in any way corroborative of it?

To my mind, the context in which the above portion of the charge
appears affords an answer to the first branch of the question.

The learned trial judge had first warned the jury that they
should be reluctant to convict upon the uncorroborated

[Page 140]

evidence of the complainant and pointed out that if they did so,
it was a very serious responsibility to assume unless her story had â€œbeen
corroborated in some material aspectâ€. He then proceeded to say:

It is proper that we should take just a moment to consider
as to whether the story of the complainant has been corroborated in a material
aspect. I think I need only recall to you her story as to what took place in
that gully or depression in the land that has been referred to, about her
clothes being removed, and the nature of the assault which she alleges
this man made upon her.

Then followed the portion of the charge which is objected to as
already set out above. In my opinion, the reference to the condition of the
area in the part objected to relates to the reference in the earlier part to
the complainantâ€™s evidence as to the nature of the assault which she alleged
had been made upon her and, in my opinion, would be so understood by the jury.
The learned trial judge in a subsequent passage of his charge, returns to the
relation of the complainantâ€™s evidence as to the assault and the existence of
the beaten down area and the bearing of the one upon the other when he said:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasionâ€”it is for you gentlemen to sayâ€”there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

I am of opinion, therefore, that in the portion of the charge
objected to as first set out above, there is no implication that the learned
trial judge was telling the jury that the complainant had made any statement
with regard to the condition of the beaten down area.

There remains to be considered the second branch of the question,
namely, as to whether or not the evidence of Robson could be properly regarded
as corroborative of the evidence of the complainant with respect to the
struggle which she alleged had taken place between herself and the appellant.
To put the matter another way, while the complainant had not said that the
grass was pressed down as the result of the struggle, she had given evidence of
a struggle and Robsonâ€™s evidence as to the condition he found would be
consistent with a struggle having taken place at that point and therefore
corroborative of the evidence of the complainant unless it were clearly
established as a matter of fact that the struggle described in evidence by the

[Page 141]

complainant was of such a limited character that it could not
have been the cause of an area of the extent described by Robson. In
considering this matter, it is to be remembered that if the complainantâ€™s
evidence that she did not consent and that she was attacked was accepted by the
jury, the latter may well have considered that the complainant was not to be
held literally to her account of the struggle as she was not, in her agitated
condition in the circumstances of the attack, likely to have noted it in detail
or to have remembered it fully afterwards. Giving due weight to the
circumstances, the jury may well have considered that no difficulty arose in
this matter. In my view, this was a matter of fact entirely for the jury and no
ground is presented for interference by the court. This question of fact was
expressly left to the jury as such in the second passage of the charge to which
I have referred, namely: â€œIndicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasionâ€”it is for you gentlemen to sayâ€”there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by sixâ€. The learned dissenting judge
refers to this part of the charge but takes the view that the complainantâ€™s
description of the struggle and the extent of the beaten down area were quite
inconsistent the one with the other. This is a finding of fact. With respect,
this was, in my opinion, a matter purely within the province of the jury.

The fact that appellant had given evidence that the area was
beaten down when he and the complainant first arrived at the place has no
relevancy to the point under discussion. The learned trial judge in the passage
of his charge referred to, was not dealing with any evidence given by the
appellant, but was dealing with the evidence of the complainant and some
aspects in which her evidence was corroborated by that of Robson. He had
already charged the juryâ€”

There are two things that I wish to stress in regard to the
facts of the case as apart from the law: in my review I cannot pretend to
review everything; I try to assist you with a review of some of the more
important parts of the evidence, but that does not relieve you from your duty,
with your twelve joint memories, of recollecting and considering anything that
may be of importance in deciding the real issue

[Page 142]

in this case; and if I express an opinion on the facts, or
seem to express an opinion, you are not bound to follow my opinion unless your
own happens to be the same.

Viewing the evidence as I do, there is no question of law
involved in the dissent below, but merely matters of fact. I would, therefore,
quash the appeal.

RAND J.â€”This is an appeal by the accused from a conviction for
rape and comes here through the dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario of
Laidlaw, J.A., on a point of law.

The only issue at the trial was consent or no consent, and the
point on which the dissent arose was in relation to a portion of the judgeâ€™s
charge which dealt with corroboration.

The woman was twenty years of age and the young man eighteen. Her
story was of struggle until exhaustion, although terrified by threats of bodily
injury. The occurrence took place a short distance in the country from the city
of Hamilton in a low-lying area about twenty feet by six, over which the grass
had been beaten down until it was almost flat. Pictures of the surrounding land
indicated the grass to be fairly high and somewhat coarse and heavy.

A witness, who had reached the spot while the accused was still
there and naked, gave evidence of that state of the grass. The complainant had
not in her evidence referred to it. The accused gave a similar description of
it but added that it was in that condition when he and the complainant had come
to it. This latter feature was not challenged either in crossâ€‘examination
or in rebuttal.

In his charge to the jury, the trial judge used the following
language:

They told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but
her skirt and jacket on, and they described the condition of the area twenty
feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box
here to-day.

And later in the charge:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasionâ€”it is for you gentlemen to sayâ€”there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

[Page 143]

In the peculiar circumstances of the case presented,
extraordinary even as told by the complainant, and in view of the sole issue
before the jury, I doubt that any single suggestion could have carried more
weight to incline the balance of their judgment than that the grass in this
spot might have shown the condition it did as a result of her struggles. So far,
however, from that being the fact, it is beyond controversy, on the evidence,
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the story of the complainant or to the case of the
Crown. It was, therefore, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that we
are quite unable to say that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching
their verdict.

The conviction should, therefore, be quashed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed, and new trial
directed.

1The accused stands charged for that he: 

""On 23 December 2009, at Wagga Wagga in the State of New South Wales did assault [the complainant] and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on [the complainant], (namely) taking hold of her hand, rubbing her palm stating, 'do you know what this means? It means I want to have sex with you'"". 

2The charge was not brought until 8 September 2010, that being the date on which the Court Attendance Notice was created. According to the Service Copy of the CAN that is with the papers, it was personally served on the accused on that same date. 

3A plea of Not Guilty was entered on 14 October 2010 when the matter first came before the Court. Because of local administrative arrangements with the Local Court in the area (the regular Magistrate at Wagga Wagga was part heard in a matter at Albury), I heard this matter at the Wagga Wagga Local Court on 11 February 2011. The accused was and remains unrepresented. He lives in Melbourne. At the conclusion of the prosecution case the prosecutor fairly and appropriately indicated (without making any concessions) that there may be an issue as to whether the conduct of the accused, taken at its highest, could amount to an indecent assault. Given the importance of the matter, and the complexity involved I decided to reserve my decision. The accused lives in Melbourne, and Albury is closer than Melbourne. In those circumstances I deemed it appropriate to give my decision in Albury. 

4The accused was unrepresented at the hearing before me. Conformably with the legislation i.e. s. 294A Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the accused was not permitted to cross-examine the complainant. Ms. J. Mountford, a Registrar with the Court Registry at Wagga Wagga was appointed to assist the accused and cross-examine the complainant. Given the cross examination, it seems that the facts are in relatively short compass. As I understand from what was asked, and from what the accused said to me, he does not dispute the act as alleged in the averment in the Court Attendance Notice. On a number of occasions the accused indicated to me that the complainant ""misunderstood"" what he was doing and saying. 

5The prosecutor made an application for the complainant to give her evidence by way of closed circuit television. For reasons given ex tempore before the complainant gave evidence I acceded to that application. 

6The evidence for the prosecution consisted of oral evidence of the complainant and that of her mother. It seems that as is very often the case in matters of the sought that I am considering the evidence by the informant police officer is of a formal nature as to the charging process, and accordingly, does not advance the prosecution case. I have obtained a transcript of the evidence of the complainant. The evidence of the complainant's mother was relatively brief, and I have a comprehensive note of that evidence. 

7On the afternoon of 23 December 2009 the complainant attended the professional premises of the accused who at the relevant time was a dentist practicing in Wagga Wagga. She attended for an interview for possible employment as a dental assistant with the accused (see pp. 2-3). The accused answered the door and ushered the complainant to a waiting room. She was provided with a cordial type drink. After waiting some little while the accused returned to where the complainant was seated, and directed the complainant to his office. In showing the complainant to his office the accused placed his hand in the middle of the complainant's back (p. 3 l. 46). 

8The complainant went on to recount that the accused ""talked very vaguely about the position. Then he ...sort of leaned in, moved his chair really close and made a comment about me eyes. He said that I had beautiful eyes..."" (p. 4 ll. 40-42). The complainant moved away from the accused (p. 5 l. 14). The complainant had her hands in her lap, and the accused leant over and put his hands on her hands (p. 5 l. 22). The accused rubbed her hands and told her not to be scared of his affection as he is friendly towards his staff and he looks after them - see p. 5 ll. 35-7. The accused made a comment about the complainant being a ""good size"" and ""not too skinny"" - see p. 6 ll. 2-5. The accused told the complainant that she would not be able to wear high heels at the work place. 

9The accused proceeded to show the complainant the examination room. According to the complainant the accused had his hand in the small of her back for about 5 seconds. Her hands were by her side and the accused grabbed one of her hands and lifted it up (p. 7 l. 23). He commenced to rub the hand, ""moving his fingers and -like all over my hands"" (p. 8 line 1). The accused made a comment about having to order in smaller gloves for the complainant. At p. 8 line 15 the complainant said, ""I was scared. I really wanted to - you know, to pull my hand away and so - and leave but I was too scared"". 

10After the complainant had pulled her hand away the accused then asked the complainant to remove her shoes in order that he could see how tall she was. The complainant complied with the request - p. 8 l. 35. The accused then went to the complainant and had one of his arms pressed against her. 

11The complainant was told to put her shoes back on, and with that she was shown to another room where the accused reclined on a dentist's chair. He was about 2 metres from the complainant. It was obvious to the complainant that the accused had an erection at this point in time (p. 10 lines 10-14). According to the complainant the accused maintained to her that women found his irresistible (p. 11 l. 36). 

12There was further conversation including that he had attempted to secure the services of a female dentist to assist him (p. 12 l. 10 et seq). After that conversation the accused again took hold of one of the complainant's hands and commented to the effect that it was good that she did not wear much jewellery. He had hold of her hand for about 15-20 seconds. He was rubbing the hand that he was holding. At p. 12 line 50 and continuing the complainant said, ""I froze. I was scared, I didn't want him to touch me. And I'm sure he knew that because he kept, like, stating, 'don't be afraid of my affection', you know, 'I'm just a really friendly person"". 

13Shortly thereafter the accused gave the complainant a box of chocolates, at which time the accused wished the complainant Merry Christmas, and indicated that the chocolates had been for another staff member but she did not want them. He also began to discuss a starting date for the complainant. He was going through a diary at this time. The complainant said to the accused, ""I don't care, just pick a date. It's fine"". She maintained that she had no intention of taking the position, but that she ""just wanted to - just get out of here, but I didn't want to say, 'no, I don't want the job"". 

14The accused put his hand on the complainant's thigh (p. 14 lines 40-46) and again said words to the effect of ""don't be frightened by my affection"". 

15It was soon thereafter that the act relied upon by the prosecution to ground the charge against the accused occurred. The complainant gave evidence at p. 15 lines 15-21: 

""He - he asked me if - he picked up my hand off my lap - my hands were in my lap. He picked up by left hand and was holding it in his hand and he was stroking the middle of my palm with his - like his pointer finger or index finger, or whatever it's called. Then he asked me, you know, 'do you know what this means?' and I said, 'no'. I knew what it meant but I didn't want to go there with that conversation. And he said, 'it means that I want to have sex with you'"". 

The stroking of the hand went on for about 20 to 30 seconds (p. 15 l. 29). The complainant immediately pulled her hand away. 

16The complainant conceded that she was at the accused's premises for at least two hours (p. 18 l. 41). She later spoke to her mother about the incident. I will return later to the issue of complaint. 

17The cross-examination was conducted by a person appointed by the Court pursuant to the provisions of s 294A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The complainant was not shaken in respect of any of her evidence in the course of that cross-examination. She maintained that on the occasions that the accused had his hand on her back it was for 5 to 10 seconds (p. 22 l. 19). When asked why she did not leave she said, ""I was scared, and when I was scared I've just froze"" (pp 22-3). She denied that the accused indicated that from time to time he might touch her arm at work and further denied that she agreed that this would be ""OK"" (p. 23 - lines 45 & 48). It was put that the accused said that he was an affectionate person once or twice. The complainant maintained her evidence in chief that it was said a number of occasions (p. 25 l. 29). At p. 27 l. 13 the following was asked: 

""Q: I put to you that you have misconstrued this whole event?"" 

18The complainant answered: 

""A: That's incorrect"". 

Immediately thereafter the question ""did you invent this statement"" was asked. The complainant answered that she did not. 

19I note also that the accused said a number of times during the proceedings that the complainant misconstrued the events. 

20I return to the issue of complaint. The complainant maintained that she told her mother about the events, and that at the time of so doing she was upset and crying. There was not a great deal of detail given. That should not be taken as any criticism of the complainant or indeed her mother. The complainant's mother gave evidence that she spoke to her daughter at about 7.45pm on the 23 December 2009, i.e. the date of the alleged incident. The evidence was that her daughter told her that the accused spoke for about 5 minutes about the job, and then spent a lot of time talking about sex and behaved in an inappropriate fashion. The events relied upon by the prosecution to ground the charge of Indecent Assault did not form part of the evidence of the complainant's mother. 

21The High Court in its decision in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 approved the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131. As I understand the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v BD evidence of complaint can be admissible on a number of bases: (i) as to the truth of the contents of the representation - s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, subject of course, to the requirement of recency ( Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606 ) but noting the effect of s 66(2A) of the Evidence Act 1995; (ii) pursuant to s 60 (hearsay evidence for a non hearsay purpose) for e.g. going to consistency of conduct; or (iii) pursuant to s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 - i.e. to re-establish credit where it has been suggested either expressly or by implication that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion. Given the vague nature of the evidence of complaint both from the complainant and her mother I am prepared to admit the evidence of complaint going to consistency of conduct rather than for the hearsay purpose of the truth of the contents of what was said by the complainant. This however, has no bearing on the matter that now falls for me to determine. 

22The accused is unrepresented, and accordingly, as is invariably the case with unrepresented accused persons, the court cannot receive any meaningful assistance. The prosecutor, however, fairly and appropriately conceded that it may fall for the Court's consideration as to whether the prosecution case that the accused conducted himself in the fashion set out in the averment of the Court attendance notice could amount to an Indecent Assault. 

23For the purpose of deciding the issue of whether there is a prima facie case, I must take the prosecution evidence at its highest. No one should assume that I have at this stage made any findings of fact. In deciding this issue I must take the evidence of the complainant at its highest. 

24The High Court in May v O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 said at [7]: 

When at the close of the case for the prosecution, a submission is made that there is 'no case to answer' the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands the defendant ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands he could lawfully be convicted. This is really a question of law. Unless there is some special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a case to answer has no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning to end. 

25The prosecution do not have to prove a separate assault and separate act of indecency in order to succeed on a charge of Indecent Assault. The Court of Appeal of NSW considered the provisions of s. 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 in the decision of Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 84 A Crim R 333. At 340 Sheller JA said: 

In 1925 in Sorlie 25 SR (NSW) 532 at 535, Street CJ with the concurrence of the other members of the court rejected the contention that what was contemplated was not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind, and an independent act of indecency. His Honour said: 

""...I think that any assault, which of itself amounts to the commission of an act of indecency upon the female assaulted or which of such a character as to involve an act of indecency upon her, comes with the terms of the section, and is a punishable offence"". 

So the law has stood since. 

26Kirby ACJ in that same decision said at p. 335: 

In Sorlie the court rejected the submission that there must be 'not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind and an independent act of indecency'. The authority of this holding has stood for more than 70 years. When s. 61L of the Crimes Act was drafted in like terminology, it must be assumed that the drafter and Parliament were aware of R v Sorlie and intended the same approach to be applied. It is now too late to resurrect the rejected arguments of 1924, to re-dissect the statutory requirements and to oblige the prosecution to prove both an assault and an independent act of indecency. 

I therefore agree with the other members of the court that, to the extent that Ireland J concluded that it was necessary for the appellant to prove an assault 'in the customary sense', that is, that he intentionally or recklessly put his victim in fear of immediate physical or other unlawful danger, he erred. 

27The conduct said to amount to an Indecent Assault in the matter I am considering is the accused taking hold of the hand of the complainant, rubbing her palm with his index finger and saying the words, ""Do you know what this means, it means I want to have sex with you"". It is difficult in the extreme to perceive of a situation where the taking of the hand and rubbing the palm could amount to an Indecent Assault. In the matter presently under consideration, it is the words spoken at the time that potentially make the alleged actions of the accused indecent. 

28Whether something is indecent is judged by prevailing community standards. After reviewing the judgments on the concept of indecency in Crowe v Graham (1968) 121 CLR 375, Debelle J in giving the leading judgment in Phillips v South Australia Police (1994) 75 A Crim R 480 said at 485: 

Thus all four justices used the same criterion, namely, contemporary standards of the Australian community but that test was used by Windeyer J. to determine both what is indecent and obscene. 

29Debelle J went on to say at 485-6: 

In A-G -v- Huber (1971) 2 SASR 142 at 167, 184 and 205-6 Bray CJ defined indecent behaviour as that which offends to a substantial degree against the recognised standards of common propriety...the requirement in Bray CJ's test that the material should offend to a substantial degree is intended, I think, to convey the view that the standards to be applied are those which ordinary decent minded but not unduly sensitive, people accept. 

30His Honour also said at 486: 

When considering contemporary standards currently accepted in the Australian Community, regard is had to the reasonable, ordinary, decent minded but not unduly sensitive person. As Windeyer J. notes in Crowe -v- Graham , contemporary standards are not the standards of those who peddle obscenities or indecencies nor that of the judge seeking to minimise what is indecent or obscene in order supposedly to show some judicial broadmindedness. 

31The decision of Phillips v South Australia Police also is authority for the proposition that the words ""indecent"", ""obscene"" and ""immoral"" all have different meanings - see the judgment of Debelle J at pp. 489-90. 

32The respective positions of the complainant and the accused are relevant. The complainant was a 17-year-old young lady who was attending the professional premises of the accused for a job interview. The accused is a middle-aged man, who in the particular circumstances was in a very superior position to the complainant. One can readily understand the complaint when she said on a number of occasions that she ""froze"". 

33In the decision of whether or not the matter is indecent I must be careful to ensure that I apply the contemporary standards of the reasonable, ordinary, decent minded but not unduly sensitive person rather than my own. Magistrates are very much part of the community, particularly in rural areas. Doing the best I can to apply those contemporary standards, noting what I have said above about taking the prosecution case at its highest, while the conduct of the accused in taking the hand of the complainant, rubbing it in the manner alleged, and using the words attributed in the circumstances of the difference in position, applying the test set out above, is indecent for the purposes of the decision that I am making at this stage of the proceedings. The issue of proof beyond reasonable doubt is an entirely different concept to be decided after all of the appropriate warnings and directions. The context of the conduct of the accused is also important. The accused touched the complainant a number of times, and at one stage had an obvious erection. 

34There is another issue: is there any evidence of intention by the accused to obtain sexual gratification. Lee J (Wood & Matthews JJ agreeing) in Harkin v R (1989) 38 A Crim R 296 said at 301: 

The purpose or motive of the appellant in behaving in that way is irrelevant. The very intentional doing of the indecent act is sufficient to put the matter before the jury. But if the assault alleged is one which objectively does not equivocally offer a sexual connotation, then in order to be an indecent assault it must be accompanied by some intention on the part of the assailant to obtain sexual gratification. 

35I do not have a transcript of the prosecutor's comprehensive submissions. However, my notes and recollection indicate that the thrust of the prosecutor's arguments were that intention to obtain sexual gratification can easily be inferred from the actions of the accused for the duration that the complainant was in his company, including having the erection at an earlier stage, and the words used. The issue of consent was also covered in the course of submissions. While the complainant may have acquiesced in the accused taking her hand, for the purposes of determining whether there is a prima facie case the complainant could not be taken to have been consenting to the rubbing of her palm, in particular, in the circumstances of the accused also uttering the words attributed. 

36The accused's submissions, with respect do not really assist on the issue of whether I find a prima facie case. He submitted that the complainant misconstrued what was said. Further, that he made a lot of comments, and that he did not touch her for long. 

37I must admit to vacillating on this issue. For the purpose of the decision I am making at this stage of the proceedings, once the finding is made that the conduct of the accused was indecent, then it seems on the decision of Harkin v R I am obliged to find a prima facie case. 

38However, for these reasons I find that there is a prima facie case.

and

His Majesty the
King Respondent.

1907: February 25, 26; 1907: February 28.

PRESENT:â€”Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington,
Maclennan and Duff JJ.

ON APPEAL PROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal lawâ€”Practiceâ€”Crown case
reservedâ€”Reserved questionsâ€” Dissent from affirmance of
convictionâ€”Appealâ€”Jurisdictionâ€” Criminal
CodeÂ , 1892, ss. 742Â , 743Â , 744Â , 750Â â€”R.S.O. (1906), c. 146, ss. 1013,1015, 1016,1024â€”Admission of
evidenceâ€”Res gestae.

Evidence of statements made by a person, since deceased,
immediately after an assault upon him, under apprehension of further danger and
requesting assistance and protection, is admissible as part of the res gestce,
even though the person accused of the offence was absent at the time when such
statements were made. Reg. v. Beddingfield (14 Cox 341); Rex v. Foster (6 C.
& P. 325) and Aveson v. Kinnaird (6 East 188) followed.

Statements not coincident, in point of time, with the
occurrence of the assault, but uttered in the presence and hearing of the
accused and under such circumstances that he might reasonably have been
expected to have made some explanatory reply to remarks in reference to them, are
admissible as evidence.

On the trial of an indictment for murder the evidence was that
the deceased had been killed by a gun shot wound inflicted through the
discharge of a gun in the hands of the accused and the defence was that the gun
had been discharged accidentally.

Held, that, in view of the character of the defence and
the evidence in support of it, there could be no objection to a charge by the
trial judge to the jury that the offence could not be reduced by them from
murder to manslaughter but that their verdict should be either for acquittal or
one of guilty of murder.

Two questions were reserved by the trial judge for the opinion
of the court of appeal but he refused to reserve a third question, as to the
correctness of his charge on the ground that no objection to the charge had
been take at the trial. The court of appeal

[Page 285]

took all three questions into consideration and dismissed the
appeal, there being no dissent from the affirmance of the conviction on the
first and third questions, but one of the judges being of opinion that the
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered upon the second question
reserved. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,â€”

The majority of the court, being of opinion that the appeal
should be dismissed, declined to express any opinion as to whether or not an
appeal would lie upon questions as to which there had been no dissent in the

Per Girouard J.â€”That
the Supreme Court of Canada was precluded fromÂ  expressing an opinion on points
of law as to which there had been no dissent in the court appealed from, McIntosh
v. The Queen (23 Can. S.C.R. 180) followed. Viau v. The Queen
(29 Can. S.C.R. 90) ; The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen (31
 Can. S.C.R. 81) and Rice v. The King (32 Can. S.C.R. 480)
referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of the North-West Territories, affirming the conviction of the appellant at the trial on an
indictment for murder, upon a reserved case stated by the judge who presided at
the trial.

The case reserved was stated by the trial judge,
Mr. Justice Newlands, as follows:â€”

""STATED CASE.""

""The above named Josiah Gilbert was charged
before me with the murder of one Barrett Henderson on or about the 15th day of
August, A.D. 1906, near Regina
in this judicial district. The accused pleaded not guilty and was tried before
me with a jury at Regina on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of November,
1906, and was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging at Regina on the 18th day of January, 1907.

""At the trial the annexed evidence was
admitted after being objected to by counsel for the accused.

[Page 286]

""After the verdict the counsel for the
accused applied to have the following questions reserved and I have, decided to
reserve the same under section 937Â  of the Criminal CodeÂ  for the opinion of the
court.

""1. Were: the statement; of the deceased
made while running towards Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them
admissible?

""2. Were the statements made by the
deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm
admissible?

""Said counsel for the accused also applied
to have the following question reserved:â€”

""3. Was the learned trial judge right in
stating to the jury in his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in
reducing the verdict from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted
only a verdict of murder or not guilty?

""In my charge to the jury I said, 'As far
as man-slaughter is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which
would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As
far as this case is concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before
you of provocation. As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has
been given in evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from
murder to manslaughter. The verdict as far as I can see can either be one of
not guilty, or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as
far as I can see, that are open before you.'

""No objection was taken to this charge at
the trial so I declined to reserve this question.""

""Regina, December 14th, 1906.""

""H. W. Newlands, J.S.C.""

[Page 287]

After hearing the
arguments of counsel, the court, in banc, affirmed the conviction, the opinion of the court being
unanimous as to the first and third questions. Mr. Justice Wetmore dissented
from the opinion of the majority of the court as to the
points of law involved in the second question.

His Lordship Chief
Justice Sifton and their Lord-ships Justices Newlands and Stuart concurred in
the following opinion
delivered by His Lordship Mr. JusÂ­tice Harvey.

Harvey J.â€”""The accused was charged with murder and tried by my brother Newlands with a jury and convicted,
and the matter now comes before this court by
way of a reserved case as to the admissibility of certain evidence which was given on the trial.

""Two men were
passing near the scene of the alleged murder about the
time it was supposed to have been committed
and their attention was drawn to the accused
whom they saw running with something in his hand, which they took to be
a gun and which the subsequent evidence shews was a gun. At almost the same moment they heard a shout and saw the deceased
apparently fleeing from the accused and waving
his hands and calling to them to stop. The gun was dropped, but the pursuit continued until the deceased reached
the witnesses, and on his way to them and when reaching them, he shouted more
than once, 'Hold on, hold on; he shot me and he will shoot me again. Hold on, boys, hold on.' The first question
which is reserved is whether the
evidence of these statements was
properly admitted, and I am of the opinion that this question should be
answered in the 20 1/2

[Page 288]

affirmative. Apart
altogether from whether the words were uttered in the
presence of the accused, it appears to my
mind clear that the circumstances, including
the utterance of the words used, were so closely connected with the
shooting as to be properly admissible for, although the witnesses in question
did not hear the sound of a shot, another witness did hear such sound and
almost immediately after saw the two men
running as they were when they first attracted the attention of the two witnesses
first mentioned.

""The strongest
case which could be referred to against the admissibility of this evidence was Reg. v. Bedingfield ([1]), in which Chief
Justice Cockburn refused
to receive the evidence of a statement made by the
deceased to a person whom she met after coming out of the house where the
accused was and where the murder was alleged
to have been committed. It is easy to see a difference in principle
between the two cases. In the present case
there was a continuity of circumstances of which the shooting was part and in
which the accused was a participant, which did not exist in the Bedingfield Case ([2]).
So that for the purpose of this case it is not necessary to dissent from Chief
Justice Cockburn's view though some of the text writers, Taylor, par. 583; Phipson, p. 49, express
the view that he interpreted the rule too
strictly.

""In Rex v. Foster ([3]) the court, consisting of three judges,
held as admissible a statement made by the deceased in answer to a question by
a witness who did not see the act which was
the cause of the death but came up
after. This case appears to have been accepted as authoritative, and the principle is given by Taylor, par. 583, as follows: ""The
principal points








[Page 289]

for consideration are, whether the circumstances
and declarations offered in proof were so connected with the main fact under consideration as to illustrate
its character, to further its object
or to form in conjunction with it one
continuous transaction.""

""It appears to
me beyond question that the present case falls within this principle and the authority of Rex v. Foster ([4]).

""The second question reserved is as to the
admissibility of evidence of an expression of
the deceased at a later time and in
no way connected with the res gestce. An exchange of
conveyances was being made by the deceased
and the accused, and the witness states
that while the deceased was being helped by him across, he turned around and saw the accused who was about
five or six feet behind, whereupon 'he made a
big jump into the buggy and said, 'Don't let him knife me.""

""This utterance appears to me to be nothing
more than an unequivocal exclamation indicating fear of injury from the accused on the part of the deceased. The principle
on which an exception to the rule that hearsay
evidence is inadmissible is made in the case of statements made in the
hearing of an accused, or in a civil case in
the hearing of an opposite party, is that
he has an opportunity of denying it, and if he fails to do so, it is
some evidence as against him of the truth of
the statement. When one considers that the utterance in question is not a
statement of fact at all and is not
susceptible of denial by the accused, it is at once evident that the principle has no application and at the same
time the principle of exclusion as hearsay has no application. The question
appears to








[Page 290]

me to be one then simply of
whether the state of mind of the accused in
this respect is material, and if it is, there is no rule as far as I am aware that requires the exclusion of this remark. It seems to me that
the evidence of the witness when he said that when de-ceased saw accused near him 'he made a big jump
into the buggy' stands in exactly the same position as the evidence of
what deceased said, for each indicates the
same thing, viz., fear of accused, and nothing more except that the
spoken words are less equivocal than the act.

""The charge is one of
deliberately shooting the deceased while the
defence is that the shooting was purely accidental. If it were shewn that after
the shooting the state of mind of the
man shot were one of friendliness to
the accused, it surely would be deemed
to have an important bearing on the question in issue, and in the same way evidence indicating aversion and fear have
as important a bearing in the opposite
direction. Wigmore, in his work on Evidence,
points out very fully the difference between the admission of utterances as proof of the truth of the facts stated and
their admission to prove a state of mind
which he terms their circumstantial use as opposed to the other or testimonial use, and states, in par. 1790, that to the use circumstantially the
hearsay rule makes no opposition 'because the utterance is not used for the sake of inducing belief in any
assertion it may contain.'

""For
the reason stated I am of opinion that this evidence was properly admitted.

""A third question,
though not reserved, was argued by counsel,
viz., that the learned judge erred in charging the jury that there was
no evidence to justify them in finding a verdict
of manslaughter.

[Page 291]

""No
one gave evidence of the actual shooting except the accused himself, and his
evidence and evidence of admissions made by him before the trial was the only evidence of the
actual occurrence. These all concurred in maintaining that the shooting was
purely accidental.
If the jury had believed this evidence, the only verdict they could have found would have been one of acquittal; but if they did not believe it,
the only conclusion from the
evidence was that the shooting having been established the intention to
effect the natural consequence of the act
existed and that the act was one of
murder. It is quite easy to see that a hypothesis
could be advanced that the actual facts made the case one of
manslaughter, but that the accused, being
the only eye witness of the shooting, determined
to concoct a story which would enable him
to escape the consequence of even that act; but this would be simply a
hypothesis, and the jury were bound to bring
in a verdict on the evidence and not on
hypothesis. I am of opinion that the judge's charge was right in this respect.

""In
the result therefore the learned trial judge's rulings on the two questions reserved and on the other
question which was argued should be confirmed and the conviction should be affirmed.""

The
opinion of Mr. Justice Wetmore was delivered, as follows:â€”

Wetmore J.â€”""I agree with my brother Harvey that the evidence of the statements made by the
deceased Henderson to the witnesses Koch and
Dick while coming towards them and after he arrived there was properly admitted as being part of the res
gestce. I also agree that there was no misdirection in the case. 

[Page 292]

But I am
of opinion that the statement made by the deceased and testified to by McKinnon,
namely, 'Don't
let him knife me,' was improperly received in evidence. This statement was offered
in evidence as
a statement made in the presence and hearing of the accused and only upon that ground.
It was not pretended that it was
admissible on any other ground. Evidence of this character is admissible
because the jury or judge of fact is able to
draw an inference from the conduct,
the language, or the silence of the other
party in whose presence and hearing the statement is made. Evidently, if the statement was not heard by such party, no inference could be drawn from his conduct, language or silence. In this
case I may say that any reference that
might be drawn was to be drawn from
the silence of the accused. In order
to render such testimony admissible I think that the judge ought to be thoroughly satisfied that the party accused
heard the statement. I will concede
that, ordinarily, if it is established that the statement was made in the presence of the accused and that he was at such a distance at the time that
the statement would likely be heard
by him, this would be sufficient to
admit the evidence of the statement. But if the circumstances are of such a
character that render it possible that the statement might not have been heard by him or render it doubtful whether it
was heard by him, evidence of the
statement ought not to be received.
In this case the witnesses Koch and
Dick were not very far distant from where the deceased and the accused were at the time the statement was made, and I think they would have been likely to hear it. Now, if they did not hear it, I think it is open to doubt whether the accused heard
it. I am not prepared, however, to
state that I would

[Page 293]

hold that the evidence of this statement was
improperly received if there was nothing further in the case than what I have stated. But it was developed at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings that the accused was hard of hearing, and he distinctly swore that
he did not hear the statement made by the deceased and testified to by
McKinnon. This state of facts having come
out, in my opinion rendered the testimony of McKinnon as to the statement inadmissible, or in other words
improperly received. It is urged that inasmuch as the testimony when received
was admissible, it is not rendered inadmissible by testimony subsequently
given. I dissent from that proposition. If
testimony of this character is
received under a mistaken apprehension of facts it must be considered none the
less inadmissible if future
developments of facts shew that it ought not to have been admitted. In a case of that sort I am of opinion that either the jury should be
discharged from giving a verdict or
the objectionable testimony expressly withdrawn from their consideration by the
trial judge. I am inclined to think
that the latter course would have
been quite sufficient for the purpose.
It was further urged that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the admission of this testimony. I cannot accede to this
proposition either. It is very
difficult to state what will or will not
influence the mind of a juryman. The remark 'Don't let him knife me' had
no direct reference to the shooting; it must
be remembered that when the remark was made the accused had no gun with
him and a remark such as 'Don't let him shoot me' would not be pertinent as he had no means of shooting. The
words, Don't let him knife me' might
be pertinent however, and it was a
remark from which a juryman might

[Page 294]

infer
'Don't let this man who shot me, as I told you, knife me.' Nor can I bring my mind to the conclusion that this was a mere exclamation of fear alone.
Doubtless it was an exclamation of fear, but it was an exclamation which
not only expressed fear but expressed fear of
the accused. I am of opinion, for the
reasons above stated, that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.""

Chrysler K.C. and James Balfour for the appellant. The statutory provisions affecting the case are to
be found in the ""Criminal CodeÂ ,
1892,"" sections 742Â , 743Â , 744Â 
and 750Â , and in the new Code as consolidated in the Revised Statutes of 1906, sections 1013, 1015. 1016 and
1024.

The court of appeal, the
Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, was not unanimous in affirming the conviction,
Mr. Justice Wetmore being in favour of allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial; therefore, we
comply with the condition of section 742 of the old Code. We come to this court upon a judgment as entered
there and we appeal against the affirmance of the conviction by a judgment which was not
unanimous; it is of no consequence what might have been the individual reasons
of any of the judges for their opinions which led to that judgment.

We
refer to the Queen v. Cunningham ([5]), which is referred to in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([6]),
by Taschereau
J., at page 185. The question has been since discussed in the case of Viau v.
The Queen ([7]), in the








[Page 295]

judgment of the
court by Taschereau J. In the present case the third
question, although not reserved, was argued
and decided in the court below which treated the point of procedure as
having been waived. See also Rice v. The King ([8]), per Strong C. J.

We rely upon Reg.
v. Bedingfield ([9]),
on which Lord Cockburn subsequently wrote a pamphlet
which will be found in the Law Journal for
1880, at page 5. See also Best on
Evidence ([10]).
Archbold in his work on Criminal Evidence, concludes that Reg. v.
Bedingfield ([11]), was
affirmed by the decision in Goddard's Case ([12]).

Chief Justice:â€”The
appellant in this case was tried at Regina, Province of Alberta, in the month of November, 1906,
and found guilty of the murder of one
Barrett Henderson; thereupon he was sentenced
to death.

The learned judge
before whom the case was tried, at the request of
counsel for the prisoner to reserve some
questions as to the admissibility of evidence,








Â 

[Page 296]

stated a special
case for the opinion of the court of appeal. The questions reserved for the opinion of the court were:

Were the statements of the deceased made while running towards
Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them admissible?

Were the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on
arriving at the house on deceased's farm admissible?

The counsel for the
accused also applied to have the following question reserved:

Was the learned trial judge right in stating to the jury in
his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in reducing the verdict
from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted only a verdict of
murder or not guilty?

The judge in the case,
as reserved, says:

In my charge to the jury I said: ""As far as manslaughter
is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which would other-wise be
murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so
in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As far as this case is
concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before you of provocation.
As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has been given in
evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from murder to
manslaughter. The verdict, as far as I can see, can either be one of not guilty
or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as far as I can
see, that are open before you.

No objection was taken to this charge at the trial so I
declined to reserve this question.

The court of appeal, Wetmore J. dissenting, held
that the statements made by the deceased to
McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm were admissible. The court was unanimously of opinion that the statements made by deceased while running towards
Dick and Koch and after joining them were properly
admitted and also that there had been no misdirection.

A question was raised here as to whether an
appeal

[Page 297]

lies to this court on the question reserved as
to which there was no dissent in the court of appeal, but as we all agree that the appeal should be dismissed we
do not think it necessary to express
any opinion on that point of practice
nor as to whether or not the question
of misdirection was ever properly before the court below. Section 1016Â , Criminal CodeÂ ; McIntosh v. The Queen ([19]).

The first
statement of the deceased was made immediately after the assault. The only evidence as to the actual shooting was given by the accused, but a witness, Vine
Brooks, heard the sound of a shot and immediately afterwards saw two men whom
she describes as running away from the barn one apparently pursuing the other. Koch and Dick to whom the statement
admitted in evidence was made were passing on
the highway not far from the barn in which the fatal shot was fired.
When first seen by the witnesses the
accused was running through the field with something in his hand, which subsequent evidence shews was a gun,
and, almost immediately, their attention was drawn to the deceased who was
running from the accused towards them shouting, as they afterwards ascertained, for protection. The pursuit continued,
although the gun was dropped by the accused, until the deceased reached the
witnesses when he shouted to them several times as he approachedâ€”

Hold on, hold on, he shot me and he will do it again; hold on
boys, hold on.

When Koch and Dick were
examined their evidence as to what occurred under these circumstances when the
deceased approached them and immediately there-








[Page 298]

after when with
them in the vehicle was objected to. The trial judge held it to be admissible
and his ruling was
sustained by the unanimous judgment of the court of appeal, and, as was intimated at the close
of the argument here, we
entertain no doubt that the evidence
was properly admitted.

At the trial, in the
court of appeal and at the argument here, counsel for the accused relied in
support of their
objection on the case of Reg. v. Bedingfield ([20]), wherein the
admissibility of this kind of evidence was discussed and Cockburn, C.J. excluded all testimony
of declarations after the
act was done. This ruling was
much criticized at the time and led to a vigorous discussion of the whole subject by Judge Pitt
Taylor, in England, and
Professor Thayer, in the United States, in the course of which the chief justice issued a pamphlet in defence of his ruling
wherein he defines the
term res gestce:

Whatever act, or series of acts, constitute, or in point of
time immediately accompany and terminate in, the principal act charged as an
offence against the accused, from its inception to its consummation or final
completion, or its prevention or abandonment,â€” whether on the part of the agent
or wrong-doer in order to its performance, or on that of the patient or party
wronged, in order to its prevention,â€”and whatever may be said by either of
the parties, during the continuance of the transaction, with reference to it,
including herein what may be said by the suffering party, though in the absence
of the accused, during the continuance of the action of the latter, actual or
constructive,-as e.g., in the case of flight or applications for assistanceâ€”
form part of the principal transaction, and may be given in evidence as part of
the res gestce, or particulars of it.

There can be no doubt that under this definition
the statement of the deceased to Koch and Dick would be admissible as








Â [Page 299]

having been used under the apprehension of
further danger and when asking for assistance and protection even if the accused
was absent.

It will be observed further that in the Bedingfield
Case ([21])
when the woman Eliza Rudd came out
of the house with her throat cut all
action on Bedingfield's part had ceased and she was not fleeing as in the present case from her assailant.

In Rex v. Foster
([22]),
the court, consisting of three judges, held as admissible a statement made by deceased in answer to a question by a
witness who did not see
the act which was the cause of the death but came up after.

The case of Aveson v. Lord Kinnaird ([23]) bears strongly upon the point, Park J. and Patterson J. concurring. In that
case Lord Ellenborough said

if at the time she fled from the immediate personal violence
of the husband I should admit what was said.

The admissibility of the second statement to McKinnon is not so clear. It was made under these circumstances: After the deceased running up to Koch
and Dick in the road where they were joined by
Gilbert had given his first explanation of the shooting and asked for
their protection; the parties then present
separated, Koch and Gilbert going to the latter's barn to get his team while Dick and the deceased
went over to the shack in which Henderson lived with his hired man McKinnon who, on their arrival, very naturally asked for an explanation of the
occurrence which has not been given
in evidence. Subsequently, however,
Gilbert appeared on the scene with Koch; then ensues a conversation with McKinnon during the








[Page 300]

course of which
Gilbert attempted to explain that the shooting was due to an accident. The deceased who was being placed in a buggy, to be
conveyed to the hospital at
Regina for medical treatment, perceiving the accused who stood about six feet away
from him made a jump
exclaiming, ""Don't let him knife me.""

It has been argued
that this statement of the deceased is not admissible
as part of the res gestce not being
coincident in point of time with the main facts to be proved. However that may be we are all of opinion that the words spoken on this occasion are
admissible on the ground that they
were uttered in the presence and
hearing of the accused, and under such
circumstances, in the light of what he had previously stated to
McKinnon, that he might have been reasonably
expected to make some answer or remark in
reply thereto or explaining that his proximity to deceased did not involve any such danger as he seemed to feel.

The presumption,
even taking the previous statement of counsel as to the
condition of accused's hearing as a fact,
would be that he might reasonably be presumed
to have heard. And the learned and careful
trial judge has in the exercise of a discretion vested in him decided the preliminary fact and allowed the
evidence on the ground that the necessary conditions
had been fulfilled.

The later statement
of accused when giving evidence
denying having heard the statement, could not have any effect on the previous ruling or become a test of its correctness.

The charge in view
of the character of the defence and evidence in support of it cannot be complained of in so far as we can express an
opinion in the ab-

[Page 301]

sence of the text of
the charge which is not before us.

There was no case
of culpable homicide of less degree than murder presented on the evidence. And the accident testified to by the accused would
have, if credited,
entitled him to acquittal.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Girouard J.â€”Following
the decisions of this court in McIntosh v. The
Queen ([24]); Viau
v. The Queen ([25]) ; The Union Colliery Co. v. The Queen ([26]); Rice v. The
King ([27]), I
feel that I have no jurisdiction to express any opinion upon the points of law involved in questions one and three. It was decided in those cases
that no appeal lies to this court on
questions as to which there was no
dissent in the court of appeal. For
that reason I agree that the appeal must be dismissed as to those two points.

As to the second question, I concur in the
reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. I
wish to add merely a word. The trial
judge was undoubtedly the sole judge
as to the admissibility of the statement or exclamation to McKinnon. He could not suppose that the prisoner, when standing within four or
five feet, did not hear it. When,
subsequently, the prisoner, being
examined, disclosed the fact that he did not hear the deceased, the counsel for the prisoner does not appear to have requested the trial judge
to leave the veracity of this statement to the jury. Perhaps he did, and it may be that the judge left the
question to the jury. We have no means
of knowing. At all events, the point is not reserved, and is not even








[Page 302]

mentioned by the learned judge. I, therefore,
believe that, as to this second question also, the appeal should be dismissed.

Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

1BATHURST CJ: Ms Lillian Ratcliff (the appellant) was charged with two counts of supply of a prohibited drug under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act). Along with Ms Kerry Ann Buckman, whose appeal was heard simultaneously with this appeal, the appellant argued that s 25(1) of the Drug Act was invalid as being inconsistent with Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

2Freeman DCJ dismissed the appellant's motion to quash the indictment on this ground but granted the appellant a certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal to this Court.

3The appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal of Ms Buckman and each of the appellant and Ms Buckman adopted the other's submissions. I have set out the legislative framework and summarised the submissions in my judgment in respect of the appeal of Ms Buckman. It is unnecessary to repeat what I have said there.

4For the reasons I have given in my judgment in respect of Ms Buckman's appeal, I am of the view there is no inconsistency between s 25(1) of the Drug Act and Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). It follows that the appeal should be dismissed.

5BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons and with the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ.

6HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

7BLANCH J: I agree that for the reasons given by the Chief Justice the appeal should be dismissed.

Choo Han TeckÂ J:
The claims
1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This is an action by the plaintiff to recover various moneys and property, which she claimed to have been given by her to the defendant on trust. The plaintiff is a 74-year-old retiree and was at the material times a parishioner in the Church of StÂ Theresa, where the defendant was, during those times, the parish priest. The plaintiffâ€™s claims may be referred to in the following terms for convenience. There are four items of claim, namely:
(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  394,000 shares in a Malaysian public company called Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd (â€œthe Guinness sharesâ€).
(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RM350,000 in cash given to the defendant in October 1994.
(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  $30,000 given to the defendant in May 2002. This money was given in three $10,000 notes and kept in a safe deposit box in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (â€œHSBCâ€) opened in the name of the defendant in May 2002 (â€œthe safe deposit boxâ€).
(d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  $12,000 paid by the plaintiff to HSBC for unit trusts purchased in the name of the defendant when she opened the safe deposit box.
The plaintiff had also made various ancillary or alternative claims in respect of the Guinness shares, including asking for an order that the defendant provide an account of the sale of any of the shares, and any dividends received, and for an order for damages for wrongful conversion.
2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff, a Catholic since the 1960s, attended mass at the Church of StÂ Theresa from 1991 because her fatherâ€™s ashes were interred in that church. She testified that she founded her trust in the defendant over the years mainly on the office the defendant held as a priest, but she did not know, until she read his amended Defence, that he had regarded himself as her â€œspiritual directorâ€, and â€œregular priest-confessorâ€. The defendant was the parish priest at the Church of StÂ Theresa from 1989 to 2002. He was transferred to the Holy Trinity Church in 2002. However, the plaintiff continued to attend mass at the Church of StÂ Theresa with her usual regularity.
3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff testified that she was shocked to learn, on 1Â April 2003, that the defendant was under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (â€œCADâ€) for criminal offences involving money donated to the church for its building fund. The plaintiff and her family had also donated to this fund. Eventually, the defendant was charged and convicted in the District Court for various offences involving the breach of trust of church money and was sentenced to imprisonment. The plaintiffâ€™s claims in this action were not the subject of the criminal proceedings although she testified in the defendantâ€™s criminal trial and was cross-examined in relation to these items claimed. I digress here to make a quick point which will become clearer as the facts and issues of this care unfold in this judgment, namely, that if the plaintiffâ€™s evidence is accepted, then the defence of laches must fail. In other words, the plaintiff would not have sat on her rights and done nothing for an inordinately long time.
The Guinness shares
4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff testified that she had the Guinness shares since the 1960s, and her stock had been enlarged by purchases made by her father for her, as well as through bonus and rights issues. In 1994, when she had decided to open a trading account in Kuala Lumpur, she had asked the defendant â€œwhether he could hold some shares for [her] in his nameâ€, and he had agreed. She explained that she did not know her broker in Kuala Lumpur well, and therefore, had preferred not to let him know that she had so many shares in Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd. She admitted that she could not remember the exact words she had used when she handed the shares to the defendant, but she was â€œabsolutely certainâ€ that she had asked for his help, and he had agreed to help. The plaintiff testified that she only found out that the defendant had appropriated her Guinness shares to his own use when the CAD told her this in April 2003. The plaintiff did not then wish to â€œcomplicate mattersâ€ for the defendant and had instructed her solicitors to withhold her claims until after the defendantâ€™s criminal proceedings had ended.
5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The defendantâ€™s version was that the shares were given to him as a personal gift because he had agreed to act as the executor and trustee of the plaintiffâ€™s will in 1994. These shares were worth about a million dollars by counselâ€™s reckoning. It is not known what the full worth of the plaintiffâ€™s assets were at the time, but she had named the Catholic Church as the beneficiary of her house at Holland Road. In any event, the Guinness shares would form a large part of her assets. She had handed the two share certificates covering the 394,000 Guinness shares to him in the compound of the Church of StÂ Theresa on the evening of 12Â July 1994, after mass. He testified that she had told him that she had a gift for him, and had handed him a white envelope. She had told him that it contained some of her bonus shares in Guinness Anchor Sdn Bhd which were worth about $1m. He stated that he â€œcould hardly believe [his] ears as never in [his] life before had he received such a large giftâ€. The plaintiff disputed this version. The defendant further elaborated that the plaintiff had written â€œ92,000 bonusâ€ on the envelope. He explained that it was not unusual in those days for companies to give one-for-one shares and that he had got such bonus shares from other companies such as Sime Darby, Shell, and Genting Berhad. The plaintiffâ€™s claim presently is for the return of 364,000 of the Guinness shares because the defendant had sold 30,000 of the shares (for which the plaintiff claims for an account to be taken). According to the plaintiff, she did not know about the sale until sometime in 1995, after she had recovered from surgery on her eye. She was peeved that the defendant had sold her shares without consulting her. However, she was somewhat mollified when he said that he had used the sale proceeds in aid of charity. She thought that it might appear rude then to ask that he return all the other shares. She felt that her displeasure had shown through sufficiently and that the defendant would be unlikely to sell any more of her shares without her permission. Indeed, he did not do so.
The RM350,000
6 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff testified that sometime in 1994, she had wanted to transfer some of her Malaysian money to the defendantâ€™s account in Malaysia so that he could use the money for her benefit in time of need. She had written him a cheque drawn on her Citibank account in Kuala Lumpur. She later learnt that the defendant had deposited this cheque into an account in Malayan Banking Bhd that he held jointly with one Chia Li Ling. It will be seen why the facts in the defendantâ€™s criminal case are relevant in this regard. There, the defendant had pleaded guilty to a charge of misappropriation by transferring money from the parish churchâ€™s account into the joint account he held with Chia Li Ling. The defendantâ€™s case in this action before me was that the plaintiff had given him the money as a generous gift. The submission made on his behalf by his counsel, MrÂ Low, was entirely to show that there were no good reasons for the plaintiff to create a trust of this money. Furthermore, MrÂ Low questioned rhetorically why the plaintiff did nothing for years after knowing that the defendant had sold 30,000 of her shares. One answer could be that it was because she had already given the shares to the defendant and he could do with them as he pleased. Another reason could be that she believed the defendant when he told her that he had sold the 30,000 shares to raise funds for charity. The questions raised by counsel were, independently, reasonably sound; but if the plaintiffâ€™s account were true, that would be a sufficient answer to MrÂ Lowâ€™s question.
The $30,000 in $10,000 notes
7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff had rented the safe deposit box on 14Â May 2002 at HSBC in the name of the defendant and had deposited three $10,000 notes into the box. She said that this arose from a chain of events. She had drawn up a will in which the defendant had been named as the sole executor and trustee. When he told her that his papers in his church office were accessible to third parties, the plaintiff had become concerned that her will might not be kept in the privacy that she wanted. Hence she had opened the safe deposit box for the defendant to keep her will. She had also given him the three notes of $10,000 each to be used for her in case of urgent need. At that time, she also appointed the defendant as the alternate account holder of her own safe deposit box. She explained in court that although he was the alternate account holder, there was only one key and she kept it. Thus, she wanted to leave some ready cash in her executorâ€™s safe deposit box for his convenience. The defendant claimed that the $30,000 deposited into the safe deposit box was a present by the plaintiff to him. His case was that the plaintiff had already made him the joint account holder to her own safe deposit box, and hence, he had access to anything kept there so that there was no need to make provision for an emergency, so to speak. The plaintiffâ€™s answer to this was that although the defendant was a joint account holder, she held the only key to that safe deposit box. The defendant did not challenge this evidence, but that might only mean that his access to the box would be more difficult â€“ not that it would be impossible.
The $12,000 deposit
8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The plaintiff testified that HSBC was only willing to let her open the safe deposit box (which was opened in the defendantâ€™s name) if she placed a $12,000 deposit with the bank as an investment. The defendant disputed that, and claimed that the safe deposit box was opened by the plaintiff and maintained by her solely for his personal benefit, to do as he pleased, because she was sorry for him that he did not have one. He claimed that the $12,000 deposit was intended by the plaintiff to be a gift to him.
Evaluation of the evidence
9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The competing versions of the plaintiff and defendant, on each of the claims, are reasonably credible. For example, in the one, it is possible that the plaintiff had given the shares and money to the defendant, at the time when their relationship was at its strongest, intending them to be given as personal gifts to the defendant. The plaintiff was a wealthy person who had donated millions of dollars to the church and other charities. She testified that she had given $10,000 to one SisterÂ Lau, whom she did not know then, when SisterÂ Lau made a personal appeal to her for financial aid towards her studies abroad. The plaintiff testified that when SisterÂ Lau was in charge of the De LaSalle School, she had made an appeal for funds for the school and the plaintiff had responded by donating $50,000. Subsequently, when SisterÂ Lau became the principal of Catholic Junior College and appealed to her financially, the plaintiff had given a $10,000 contribution in the form of a $10,000 note that was handed to the defendant to be given to SisterÂ Lau. The defendant had kept the note and written a cheque for $10,000 from the 
Church
â€™s account. The defendant, on the other hand, claimed in this trial that the plaintiff had given him money in the form of $10,000 notes previously, and cited this occasion as an example. The defendant admitted that SisterÂ Lau had written a receipt made out to the
 
Church and handed it to him, but he had not handed it over to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiffâ€™s counsel, MrÂ Michael Khoo SC, suggested to the defendant that the receipt would have put the plaintiff on inquiry as to why SisterÂ Lau had made out the receipt to the parish church, and not to her. The defendantâ€™s version (that he had given the $10,000 note to SisterÂ Lau) was, therefore, not supported by this fact.
10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It may not be unreasonable for a person of such a generous disposition as the plaintiff to lavish her generosity in the way the defendant alleged, that is, on her priest who was also her confidant and friend (if that were the case). On the other hand, it is also possible that she had intended to keep some cash and stock in the care of her trusted priest, and friend, to her use in a time of need. The plaintiff is now 74 years old. At the time she handed the Guinness shares to the defendant in 1994, she was 63. Although she had siblings who were also wealthy, she was the main person looking after her mother and keeping her company. In 1994, her own health was threatened by a mysterious growth in her left eye that required surgery, and consequently, she made arrangements in respect of her financial assets in case she were to become incapacitated after her surgery. Her reasons for handing over the shares to the defendant, helping him open and maintain a safe deposit box, and depositing large sums of money with him for safe keeping would seem reasonable enough in the circumstances. The defendantâ€™s version in respect of the opening of the safe deposit box and the advance of the $12,000 necessary to open it, if true, would show, in a sense, the generosity of the plaintiff to the defendant to the extreme. But, if she was happy to give him the Guinness shares, then $12,000 pales immediately in comparison. The issues are thus not as straightforward or unconnected as one might think.
11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This court has to decide which of the two possibilities, each reasonable in itself, is the more probable. The core of the two competing versions of the story, that is, whether the money and shares were handed over as gifts or given upon trust, emanated from only two witnesses â€“ the plaintiff and the defendant. There was no independent corroboration of either story. There were no other witnesses to bear testimony to either account. Apart from the testimony of the two protagonists, I am left with only the peripheral and background facts from which counsel urged me to draw various inferences â€“ inferences that would incline me to one result or the other. Some of these facts are undisputed and incontrovertible â€“ such as the fact that the defendant had pleaded guilty to various criminal charges involving the misappropriation of money belonging to the 
Church 
of
 
StÂ Theresa
. But even so, some aspects of these facts remain open to question, for example, the reasons as to why the defendant decided to plead guilty midway through the criminal trial. The defendant averred that he had personal reasons, not least prompted by eminent members in the high echelons of the Catholic Church, to do so. MrÂ Khoo, however, suggested that no such thing occurred, and the conclusion he urged me to form, from his cross-examination of the defendant, was that (to put it bluntly) the defendant had pleaded guilty because he was in fact guilty. But what does that guilt mean in this case before me?
12Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SectionÂ 54 of the Evidence Act, (CapÂ 97, 1997Â Rev Ed) provides that:
In civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him is irrelevant, except in so far as such character appears from facts otherwise relevant.
I would be putting myself in danger of oversimplifying sÂ 54 were I to paraphrase this section, as saying that â€œcharacterâ€ in a civil trial is irrelevant unless the facts show that it is relevant. There is a long route through which the origin and permutations of the stiffly-worded language of this legislative provision have slowly meandered until it can be read in that short form that I have set out above. But I think that it is not necessary for me, for the purposes of this case, to provide a lengthy exculpation of my reading of sÂ 54. In his cross-examination of the defendant, MrÂ Khoo relentlessly reminded him of evidence from the criminal trial relating to his misappropriation of church funds. It was evident from the cross-examination what MrÂ Khoo had hoped to emphasise. He made that emphasis clear by his choice of words that the defendant was â€œsurreptitiously siphoning out $5.1 millionâ€ from church funds towards his personal use in the purchase of condominium flats in Penang and Singapore, and not, as the defendant asserted, something he did â€œin accordance with canon lawâ€. The question, thus, is whether these are the kinds of facts that would make the defendantâ€™s character relevant within the meaning of sÂ 54. I do not think so in this case. The key issue here is whether the property and money were gifts or not.
13Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Nonetheless, I am of the view that there is one aspect concerning the defendantâ€™s handling of the church funds that is a matter of interest to this court, although I am not required here to judge whether, and if so why, the moral compass of this priest became maladjusted. Those are not relevant questions for this court even if they do remain viable, or of interest, so far as the defendantâ€™s church and his parishioners are concerned. The relevant connection between the defendantâ€™s conduct in the criminal proceedings and the present action is this. The matters relating to the criminal case, including the acts for which he was charged, his plea of guilt, as well as his present testimony about them, such as his â€œreasons for pleading guiltyâ€, set out at some length in his evidence-in-chief, are relevant in determining whether the defendantâ€™s understanding of the meaning of fiduciary duty, and the doctrines of trust, was conventional or not. That has a direct bearing in this case because the defendant denied that he was holding the money and assets in trust for the plaintiff. The issue, hence, is whether he had a reasonable or correct understanding of that term and concept. It goes towards credibility. The facts established in the previous criminal proceedings are also relevant in establishing the manner in which the defendant was accustomed in dealing with money that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping. But to regard these as relevant for consideration does not necessarily lend assistance to the exercise of determining how much weight ought to be attached to them â€“ that is another exercise.
14Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In response, the defendant testified that he did no wrong in respect of the matters in the criminal proceedings because he had acted in accordance with canon law. MrÂ Low produced excerpts from two commentaries on canon law to support the defendantâ€™s justification of his conduct there. One was entitled 
The Canon Law â€“ Letter & Spirit
, published by the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and 
Ireland
. The second was 
New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law
, a publication of the Canon Law Society of America. The defendant testified that the parish church did not have a legal status to hold property in its own name, and since he was the parish priest of the
 
Church 
of
 
StÂ Theresa
, he was bound to invest excess church funds. But he could only do so by making the investments in his name. He testified that his interpretation of the relevant canon law justified his conduct, and which would have absolved him from any ecclesiastical as well as secular misconduct. Before proceeding further, I should address MrÂ Khooâ€™s objection to the reference to canon law. He submitted that canon law should only be admitted through expert witnesses. In so far as canon law is not the applicable law in our courts, it must be regarded just like a foreign law, admissible upon proof by experts. However, in the present case, the parties have not put these laws in issue in the sense that I am required to make a finding as to what principle or rule in canon law applied in the present case. On the contrary, neither counsel wished to quarrel over the force and effect of that law. Thus, the only relevance of the reference to canon law was to show that the defendant had relied on some of those principles in order to maintain his stand that he had done no wrong in respect of the matters in which he had been convicted. Whether he was right to do so (that is, to rely on those principles) is a separate matter, and one that is not in issue before me. However, the defendant faced a second problem. He had pleaded guilty and admitted to the Statement of Facts, which referred to the conduct that he now renounced. He therefore tried to explain to me why he had pleaded guilty. The clear impression he made in his evidence-in-chief was that he did so because various parties, including the local church authority, coerced him into it. Unless the plea and admissions are set aside, the defendant is bound by them.
15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  MrÂ Khoo submitted that many instances of MrÂ Lowâ€™s submissions were in breach of the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 (1893) 6Â R 67 in that those aspects were not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination. I have considered those passages in MrÂ Lowâ€™s submissions that MrÂ Khoo referred me to, and am of the view that I should not disregard them. I would prefer to consider them together with the entirety of the evidence. 
Browne v Dunn
 is a very old case, decided during a time when the evidence of the opposing parties was not disclosed to each other. The exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief in the modern civil trial ameliorates the mischief described by LordÂ HerschellÂ LC in 
Browne v Dunn
, at 70. That case may still be relevant where a litigant wishes to rely on a hitherto undisclosed fact that is crucial and might on its own swing the favour of the court one way or the other. The matters raised by MrÂ Khoo do not, in my view, fall into this category. By way of example, MrÂ Khoo objected to MrÂ Lowâ€™s submission that the plaintiff ought to have handed 
Singapore
 
or Australian currencies instead of Malaysian shares to the defendant if she really wanted to have ready funds. I take this as a submission as to what inference I ought to draw. I think that MrÂ Low was entitled to make that submission. As it was, MrÂ Khoo had a ready reply to the inference that MrÂ Low had in mind. So I had taken the opposing arguments into consideration.
16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Throughout the trial, many questions were raised about the motives and the intentions of the plaintiff as well as the defendant. Some of the questions have been explicitly answered, though many of the answers given by the two litigants were diametrically opposed. Why would a person in the plaintiffâ€™s circumstances wish to give a million dollars to a priest? Conversely, one might also ask: What did the plaintiff hope to achieve by asking the defendant to hold her money and property in trust for her? The plaintiff said that she thought that her money would be safe in the hands of a priest, especially one whom she had come to know and like. Intentions and motives of this nature cannot be ascertained by logic alone. On the contrary, some transactions between friends, as well as people who believe they know each other well, are like leaps of faith; they can be notoriously illogical. We can detect an inconsistent line when we ask why someone in the defendantâ€™s situation and circumstances would resist the plaintiffâ€™s claim. The defendantâ€™s counsel opened his case by reading a passage from the Bible found in chÂ 10 of the Gospel of Matthew to the plaintiff â€“ in that passage, the Christ of their common faith had exhorted the rich to forsake all their worldly goods, saying that it is easier for the camel to go through the eye of the needle than for the rich man to go to heaven. It was read by counsel for the purpose of emphasising the gift of generosity inherent in the plaintiffâ€™s nature. To that extent, that emphasis was relevant because the plaintiff was indeed a generous person, and part of my duty in this case, is to determine the extent of that generosity. I find it difficult, however, to understand the above passage from the Bible fully, without seeing how it exempts the defendant himself. Ought not the same precept to apply to the one who ministers as it does the person ministered to? There may be a good, perhaps philanthropic, reason why the defendant fought so tenaciously to keep the wealth in question; but he had not told this court what that might be. So, with generosity and avarice, so inextricably intertwined in this case, encasing the plaintiff and defendant alike, the true motive and intention of the parties â€“ and here I am referring to the full, undisguised state of mind â€“ is not clearly discernible; yet that is the heart of this case, and finding that intention is what this court has to do. There are no fixed rules as to how this might be done, but one must not be too quick to ill-judge a personâ€™s intention, or to dismiss a possibility on the basis that a right-thinking person would have intended otherwise, without making allowance for the possibility that even the most sure-footed may slip and stumble from time to time.
17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For example, in respect of one of the factual issues in this case, it will be seen that there could be two possible reasons why the plaintiffâ€™s list of assets in her will did not include the Guinness shares. One possibility is that she had already given those shares away to the defendant. The other is that she had only listed those assets that were within her own possession, excluding those held in trust. What did the plaintiff have in mind when she wrote out that list? She said that it was only to let her executor know what assets she had with her. Since the defendant was to be her executor, he did not need to be reminded that he held some of her assets. Since the inferences to be drawn from the incontrovertible facts of the transfer of property and money can reasonably be in favour of either party, and there being no corroboration of the litigants by independent witnesses, on the balance, I am more inclined to accept the uncorroborated evidence of the plaintiff than that of the defendant. Much of what the defendant asserted in his evidence might possibly be true, but many established facts are against him. He had testified that he was holding money jointly with Chia Li Ling in trust for the parish church because the parish church could not make investments on its own. Chia Li Ling was not called to explain her role in those episodes. Her evidence would be relevant because it would have corroborated, and perhaps clarified that of the defendantâ€™s own evidence, and to help me understand the defendantâ€™s perception of trust property and gifts. That omission, taken together with the absence of support from the Catholic Church in respect of his idea of trust property, left me with only his word. Thus, faced with the simple, but crucial, question, â€œDo I believe the plaintiff or the defendant?â€, I find myself reluctant to accept the defendantâ€™s evidence without corroboration. Between the two uncorroborated testimonies, I would incline towards that of the plaintiffâ€™s. I come to this conclusion without giving any piece of evidence special significance, or giving any specific evidence more weight than another, which is often possible, but not in this case.
18Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For the reasons above, I find that the balance of probabilities lies in the plaintiffâ€™s favour, and I, therefore, allow the plaintiffâ€™s claim in full. Costs are to follow the event, and be taxed if not agreed.",18/2/2005 0:00,SG High Court

Â 

24. MsÂ MichalosÂ wasÂ instructedÂ byÂ theÂ CPSÂ toÂ assistÂ theÂ courtÂ onÂ theÂ approachÂ toÂ beÂ 
takenÂ toÂ theÂ variousÂ sourcesÂ ofÂ informationÂ thatÂ haveÂ remainedÂ availableÂ onÂ theÂ 
internet,Â andÂ sheÂ highlightedÂ that,Â forÂ theÂ purposesÂ ofÂ theÂ CCA,Â theÂ mainÂ issuesÂ 
areÂ whetherÂ anyÂ particularÂ siteÂ classesÂ asÂ aÂ â€œpublisherâ€Â (sectionÂ 2(1))Â andÂ theÂ 
extentÂ toÂ whichÂ theÂ publicationÂ createsÂ aÂ substantialÂ riskÂ thatÂ theÂ courseÂ ofÂ 
justiceÂ inÂ questionÂ willÂ beÂ seriouslyÂ impededÂ orÂ prejudicedÂ (sectionÂ 2(2)).Â 
Additionally,Â itÂ wasÂ pointedÂ outÂ thatÂ underÂ sectionÂ 3(3)Â itÂ isÂ necessary,Â forÂ theÂ 
purposesÂ ofÂ strictÂ liability,Â forÂ theÂ proceedingsÂ toÂ haveÂ beenÂ activeÂ atÂ theÂ timeÂ ofÂ 
publication.Â Â 
Â 

25. WithÂ socialÂ networkingÂ sites,Â sheÂ expressedÂ theÂ viewÂ thatÂ thoseÂ thatÂ simplyÂ 

provideÂ aÂ platformÂ forÂ otherÂ usersÂ (suchÂ asÂ Google)Â areÂ unlikelyÂ toÂ beÂ regardedÂ 
asÂ publishersÂ (butÂ thisÂ generalÂ statementÂ wasÂ somewhatÂ qualified,Â asÂ setÂ outÂ 
below).Â SheÂ arguedÂ thatÂ allÂ sitesÂ thatÂ areÂ essentiallyÂ facilitators,Â suchÂ asÂ FacebookÂ 
andÂ YouTube,Â areÂ likelyÂ toÂ beÂ treatedÂ inÂ theÂ sameÂ way.Â Similarly,Â withÂ searchÂ 
enginesÂ andÂ internetÂ serviceÂ providersÂ (ISPs),Â sheÂ submittedÂ thatÂ â€œtheÂ current
--------
stateÂ ofÂ theÂ lawÂ stronglyÂ suggestsÂ thatÂ searchÂ enginesÂ andÂ mereÂ serviceÂ 
providersâ€Â (e.g.Â BTÂ andÂ TiscaliÂ whoÂ provideÂ accessÂ toÂ theÂ internet)Â â€œwouldÂ notÂ beÂ 
heldÂ liableÂ forÂ strictÂ liabilityÂ contemptÂ becauseÂ theyÂ wouldÂ notÂ beÂ regardedÂ asÂ 
publishersâ€.Â InÂ theÂ contextÂ ofÂ defamation,Â MsÂ MichalosÂ suggestedÂ thatÂ atÂ 
commonÂ lawÂ ifÂ bodiesÂ ofÂ thisÂ kindÂ provideÂ noÂ moreÂ thanÂ aÂ passiveÂ roleÂ inÂ 
facilitatingÂ postingsÂ onÂ theÂ internet,Â theyÂ areÂ notÂ deemedÂ toÂ beÂ aÂ publisherÂ (BuntÂ 
vÂ TilleyÂ [2006]Â EWHCÂ 407Â (QB);Â [2006]Â 3Â AERÂ 336).Â 
Â 

26. Â ByÂ wayÂ ofÂ atÂ leastÂ aÂ partialÂ qualificationÂ toÂ thisÂ generalÂ submission,Â MsÂ MichalosÂ 
arguedÂ thatÂ ifÂ theÂ ISPÂ isÂ onÂ noticeÂ ofÂ theÂ materialÂ inÂ questionÂ thenÂ itÂ isÂ possibleÂ itÂ 
willÂ beÂ heldÂ toÂ beÂ aÂ publisher,Â inÂ thatÂ inÂ determiningÂ responsibilityÂ theÂ stateÂ ofÂ aÂ 
defendantâ€™sÂ knowledgeÂ couldÂ beÂ anÂ importantÂ factor.Â MyÂ attentionÂ wasÂ drawnÂ toÂ 
developingÂ jurisprudenceÂ involvingÂ Google.Â InÂ MetropolitanÂ InternationalÂ SchoolsÂ 
(t/asÂ Train2Game)Â vÂ DesigntechnicaÂ &Â GoogleÂ [2009]Â EWHCÂ 1765Â EadyÂ JÂ heldÂ 
thatÂ GoogleÂ wasÂ aÂ mereÂ facilitatorÂ ratherÂ thanÂ aÂ publisher,Â andÂ thatÂ â€œpublicationâ€Â 
involvesÂ aÂ mentalÂ element,Â andÂ thisÂ wasÂ theÂ caseÂ evenÂ thoughÂ GoogleÂ hadÂ takenÂ 
stepsÂ toÂ ensureÂ thatÂ certainÂ URLsÂ wereÂ blocked:Â theÂ courtÂ heldÂ thatÂ itÂ wasÂ 
unrealisticÂ toÂ attributeÂ responsibilityÂ forÂ publicationÂ toÂ GoogleÂ ([57]Â andÂ [64]).Â 
However,Â inÂ DavisonÂ vÂ HabeebÂ &Â othersÂ [2011]Â EWHCÂ 3031,Â itÂ wasÂ decidedÂ (HHJÂ 
Parkes,Â sittingÂ asÂ aÂ HighÂ CourtÂ judge)Â thatÂ itÂ wasÂ arguableÂ thatÂ GoogleÂ wasÂ aÂ 
publisher,Â ratherÂ thanÂ aÂ mereÂ facilitator,Â ifÂ itÂ wasÂ notifiedÂ thatÂ particularÂ materialÂ 
wasÂ appearingÂ onÂ aÂ virtualÂ noticeboardÂ forÂ whichÂ itÂ wasÂ responsibleÂ [42].Â EadyÂ JÂ

Â 

on appeal from
the court of appeal for ontario

Â 

Criminal law â€” Trial â€” Verdicts â€” Accused convicted of several
offences â€” Fresh expert evidence available after convictions upheld on appeal
discrediting Crown witnesses â€” Whether verdicts would necessarily have been the
same â€” Whether manslaughter conviction should be substituted for conviction for
murder â€” Whether accused should be acquitted of murder and criminal negligence
causing death.

Â 








The accused, M and A, were convicted of offences committed against their
infant son.Â  M was convicted of second degree murder, aggravated assault and
assault causing bodily harm; A, of criminal negligence causing death and
failure to provide the necessaries of life.Â  The Court of Appeal upheld their
convictions.Â  Following the appeal, expert opinions by P and another expert
became available.Â  This fresh evidence adduced before this Court discredits
evidence given by S, an expert called by the Crown, and renders unreliable
evidence given by C, a Crown witness.

Â 

Held:Â Â The appeals should be allowed. 

Â 

The convictions of the accused should be set aside and a new trial
ordered with respect to the offences of which M and A were convicted.Â  Sâ€™s
evidence, which is now conceded to be unreliable, was central to the Crownâ€™s
case.Â  Sâ€™s evidence may have influenced the juryâ€™s conclusion on both the
causation and intent elements of the murder charge.Â  It would therefore be
inappropriate to substitute a conviction for manslaughter for Mâ€™s conviction
for murder.Â  Acquittals on the counts of murder and criminal negligence causing
death would also not be appropriate because it cannot be said that a properly
instructed jury, acting reasonably, could not find the accused guilty of the
homicideâ€‘related offences based on the remaining evidence.Â  Lastly,
although the fresh evidence relates mainly to the convictions for murder and
criminal negligence causing death, it nonetheless bears as well, albeit to a
lesser degree, on the other counts, and it would be speculative and unsafe to
conclude that any of the verdicts would necessarily have been the same but for
Sâ€™s evidence.Â  To attempt at this stage to insulate the effect of Sâ€™s evidence
on one count from its possible effect on the others would amount to an
unwarranted exercise in appellate speculation.Â  [5-7] [13-14]

Marco Trotta and his wife Anisa Trotta stand convicted of culpable
homicide and other offences, all concerning the short life and tragic death of
their infant son Paolo.

At the conclusion of their joint trial before judge and jury, Marco
Trotta was found guilty of second degree murder, aggravated assault and assault
causing bodily harm; Anisa Trotta, of criminal negligence causing death and
failure to provide the necessaries of life.Â  Their convictions were upheld by
the Court of Appeal for Ontario ((2004), 191 O.A.C. 322).

The outcome of their present appeals to this Court depends on fresh
evidence available neither at the time of trial nor when their convictions were
upheld by the Court of Appeal.Â  We have concluded that a new trial must be had
on all counts.Â  It would therefore be inappropriate to say more about either
the fresh evidence or the evidence at trial than is necessary to explain our
decision.

Â 

II

Â 

4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Essentially, the fresh evidence â€” mainly the expert opinions of Dr.
Michael Pollanen and Dr. Simon Avis â€” discredits the evidence given at trial by
Dr. Charles Smith, an expert called by the Crown.Â  And the evidence of a second
Crown witness at trial, Dr. David Chan, has been rendered unreliable as a
result.

Â 

5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
It is conceded by the Crown that the fresh evidence should be admitted
and that Marco Trottaâ€™s conviction on the murder charge cannot stand.Â  With
respect to that count, however, the Crown urges us to substitute a conviction
for manslaughter instead of ordering a new trial. The Crown contends that the
impugned evidence of Dr. Smith could have affected the juryâ€™s finding on the
fault element, or mens rea, that distinguishes murder from manslaughter,
but not on the actus reus, or element of causation common to both
offences.Â  We do not find this submission persuasive.Â  On the contrary, we
believe that the evidence of Dr. Smith may well have influenced the juryâ€™s
conclusion on both essential elements of the murder charge â€” that Mr.
Trotta caused Paoloâ€™s death and that he did so intentionally.

Â 








6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
In the Crownâ€™s view, moreover, the fresh evidence has no bearing on any
of the other convictions of either appellant.Â  We are therefore urged by the
Crown to dismiss the appeals in respect of those convictions.Â  As we shall
presently see, this submission fails as well.Â  We recognize that the fresh
evidence adduced in this Court relates mainly to the appellantsâ€™ convictions
for murder and criminal negligence causing death.Â  It nonetheless bears as
well, albeit to a lesser degree, on the other counts.

Â 

7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Both appellants, on the other hand, seek acquittals on the counts of
murder and criminal negligence causing death, and urge us to order a new trial
only on the remaining counts.Â  We are satisfied that acquittals would at this
stage be inappropriate, since we are not prepared to say that there remains no
evidence upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could find
the appellants guilty of the homicide-related offences of which they were
convicted at trial.

Â

Â 

8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
It was the position of the Crown at trial that Marco Trotta repeatedly
assaulted Paolo from shortly after his birth in September 1992 until his death
in late May 1993, and that Paoloâ€™s death resulted from a final assault sometime
shortly before he died.Â  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge summarized
the Crownâ€™s position this way:

Â 

Only by that evidence led at this trial which you accept does the Crown
seek to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Marco Trotta engaged in a
pattern of abuse, a mode of assaultive behaviour towards his infant son for the
duration of that short life and not only did his violent actions endanger the
life of Paolo by such aggravated assaultive behaviour as in count two, and
actually cause bodily harm to him by the continuing assaults, count three, but
they escalate[d] to such a degree after May 6th, 1993, that they culminated in
his murder by May 29th, 1993, and that is count one.

Â 








9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Moreover, in considering the reasonableness of the juryâ€™s verdict on the
murder count, the Court of Appeal expressly noted the potential link between
the evidence of lifetime abuse and the death of Paolo, and concluded (at para.
31):

Â 

There was cogent, if not overwhelming, evidence that
Paolo was a battered child and that Marco was his abuser.Â  On the evidence, the
jury could find that the physical abuse escalated during Paoloâ€™s life and
continued until very shortly before Paoloâ€™s death.Â  There was evidence that
Paoloâ€™s death was not the result of any disease process, natural causes (e.g.
SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]) or accidental
trauma.Â  Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence indicated that his death was consistent with head
trauma and/or asphyxia, both of which could occur as a result of an assault.Â  On
the totality of this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that the
pattern of abuse of Paolo by Marco culminated in Paoloâ€™s death at the hands of
Marco.Â  This finding was available even if the jury could not decide the exact
nature of the final assault. [Emphasis added.]

Â 

10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Again, in the words of the Court of Appeal (at para. 84):

Â 

The Crown relied on [Dr. Smithâ€™s] evidence to eliminate certain
possibilities (e.g. disease and SIDS) and to point to the most likely
possibilities, head trauma and/or asphyxiation.Â  The Crown contended that when
Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence was put with the rest of the evidence of ongoing abuse,
the resulting â€œbig pictureâ€ left no doubt that Paolo died at the hands of his
father. [Emphasis added.]

Â 

11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The Court of Appeal identified certain errors committed by the trial
judge in his conduct of the trial and in his charge to the jury.Â  He was found
to have erred in admitting some of the evidence concerning Marco Trottaâ€™s
demeanour.Â  The judgeâ€™s instruction on causation was described as â€œunfocussedâ€
and he was found to have made an â€œinappropriateâ€ remark in his charge to the
jury (paras. 58 and 81).Â  Finally, with respect to a factual error made by the
trial judge, the Court of Appeal stated (at para. 91):

Â 








The factual error made by the trial judge in his review of Dr. Smithâ€™s
evidence was significant.Â  The error related to an important part of the
evidence given by an important witness.Â  The trial judge also repeated the
error on one other occasion in the course of his instructions.Â  

Â 

Â 

The Court of
Appeal was nonetheless satisfied that none of these errors could have affected
either the fairness or the outcome of the trial.

Â 

12Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
As mentioned at the outset, however, neither the trial judge nor the
Court of Appeal had the benefit of the fresh evidence adduced in this Court.Â 
That evidence places in a fresh light the trial judgeâ€™s unfortunate errors and
the conclusion of the Court of Appeal as to their effect on the outcome of the
trial.

Â

Â 

13Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
In deciding that a new trial must be had on all the counts, we bear in
mind particularly:

Â 

(1)Â  the central importance of Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence to the Crownâ€™s case
at trial;

Â 

(2)Â  the Crownâ€™s position throughout the trial as to the relationship
between the charges;

Â 

(3)Â  that the factual error made by the trial judge in his review of Dr.
Smithâ€™s evidence was found by the Court of Appeal to be significant, and later
repeated;

Â 








(4)Â  that Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence is now conceded to be unreliable;

Â 

(5)Â  that the Court of Appeal identified several errors made at trial
that related not only to the homicide charges, but to the other counts as well;

Â 

(6)Â  the fact that the Crown chose to proceed on all the counts against
both accused at a single trial â€” and alleged, moreover, that all five
offences had occurred within an overlapping time frame;

Â 

(7)Â  that Dr. Smith testified not only as to the cause of Paoloâ€™s death â€”
the basis of the homicide charges â€” but also as to Paoloâ€™s previous injuries,
the basis of the other counts;

Â 

(8)Â  that it is impossible to determine what effect Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence
(and that of Dr. Chan) had on the juryâ€™s evaluation of the Trottasâ€™ credibility
with respect to their out of court explanations as to those injuries;

Â 

(9)Â  the fact that these explanations were put into evidence by the Crown
as part of its case against the appellants; and

Â 

(10)Â  that, understandably, the trial judge did not instruct the jury to
limit its consideration of the evidence of Dr. Smith and Dr. Chan to the
homicide counts.

Â 








14Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
In this light, we think it neither safe nor sound to conclude that the
verdicts on any of the charges would necessarily have been the same but for Dr.
Smithâ€™s successfully impugned evidence.Â  To attempt at this stage to insulate
the effect of Dr. Smithâ€™s evidence on one count from its possible effect on the
others would amount to an unwarranted exercise in appellate speculation.

Â 

15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Plainly, then, if a new trial must be had, as we think it must, the
preferable course is to order an untainted trial on all counts.

Â 

16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
For all of these reasons, both appeals are allowed, the appellantsâ€™
convictions are set aside, and a new trial is ordered with respect to the
offences of which they were convicted.

Â 

17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Having reached that conclusion for the reasons given, we find it is
unnecessary to consider the issue of post-conviction disclosure raised by the
appellants.Â  That issue has become entirely moot and should therefore be left
for another day.

The  jury  verdicts  against  the  appellant  and  Marlow  reflect  substantial 

GLEESON CJ, HAYNE AND HEYDON JJ.   The appellant appeals against the 
dismissal  by  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  of  Tasmania  of  his  appeal  against 
conviction by a jury sitting in the Supreme Court of Tasmania1.  The appellant 
was  charged  with  murdering  Tony  George  Tanner  on  or  about  23  November 
1990.  He was tried with Michael John Marlow (""Marlow""), whom the jury also 
convicted  of  murder,  and  Gary  Hilton  Williams  (""Williams""),  whom  the  jury 
acquitted both of murder and of being an accessory after the fact.   
 
The background 
 
 
acceptance of the following Crown case.   
 
 
The  Crown  contended  that  Marlow  disliked  the  victim  for  giving  the 
police information about an incident of bungled stealing in 1987.   As a result, 
Marlow  was  sentenced  to  eight  months  imprisonment  after  pleading  guilty  to 
being an accessory after the fact.  The Crown also contended that the appellant 
hated the victim for being a police informant.   
 
 
On the afternoon of 23 November 1990, the victim made an arrangement 
to meet the appellant and set out to fulfil it.  There is no evidence that he was 
ever seen alive again except by the person or persons who murdered him.  Paul 
Paget  (""Paget"")  gave  evidence  that  that  evening  he  was  present  at  a  meeting 
between  the  appellant,  Marlow  and  Williams,  at  which  it  was  agreed  that  the 
appellant would lure the victim to a logging site where the appellant had been 
working.  The plan was for Marlow to murder the victim at that place.  The role 
of Williams, according to the evidence of Paget about which the jury must have 
experienced a reasonable doubt, was to drive the victim's car to the airport and 
leave it there, so as to suggest that the victim had departed from Tasmania.   
 
 
Later, in the early hours of the morning, according to Paget, Marlow said 
that he had killed the victim with a shotgun for informing on him, and that the 
victim had been buried in a deep hole dug by the appellant with an excavator.   
 
 
On 25 November 1999 the appellant said to the police that he and Marlow 
had murdered the victim.  On 4 March 2000 during a video-recorded interview, 
although he accepted that he had confessed in this way, the appellant said that the 
confession was false and offered certain explanations for having made it.  While 
Marlow  made  no  admissions  to  the  police,  he  did  make  statements  to  other 
people in the years between 1990-2000 which could be treated as admissions.

In March 2000 the victim's body was found with shotgun wounds in a hole 
which could only have been dug by a skilled excavator operator in a log landing 
site  where  the  appellant  used  to  work.    The  appellant  was  a  skilled  excavator 
operator.    Found  with  the  body  was  a  considerable  quantity  of  builder's  lime, 
which was not a natural part of the soil at that place.   
 
The special leave point 
 
 
The appellant and  Marlow appealed to the  Court of Criminal Appeal of 
Tasmania.  The appeals were dismissed.  Both the appellant and Marlow applied 
to this Court for special leave to appeal.  Only the appellant succeeded, and only 
on one point:  whether a statement by the appellant to police officers on 4 March 
2000 (""the impugned statement"") was a ""confession or admission"" which should 
not have been received by the trial judge in view of its non-compliance with the 
requirement  of  video-taping  contained  in  s  8(2)(a)  of  the  Criminal  Law 
(Detention  and  Interrogation)  Act  1995  (Tas)  (""the  Act"").    The  impugned 
statement was made between half an hour to an hour after the video recording of 
an  interview  of  the  appellant  by  police  officers  had  ceased  and  no  further 
questions had been asked.

'official  questioning'  means  questioning  by  a  police  officer  in 
connection with the investigation of the commission or the possible 
commission of an offence; 

'serious offence' means an indictable offence of such a nature that, 
if  a  person  of  or  over  the  age  of  18  years  is  charged  with  it,  the 
indictable  offence  cannot  be  dealt  with  summarily  without  the 
consent of the accused person and, in the case of a person under the 
age  of  18  years,  includes  any  indictable  offence  for  which  the 
person has been detained.

any  confession  or  admission  by  the  accused  person  is  not  admissible 
unless â€“

there  is  available  to  the  court  a  videotape  of  an  interview 
with  the  accused  person  in  the  course  of  which  the 
confession or admission was made; or 

if the prosecution proves on the balance of probabilities that 
there  was  a  reasonable  explanation  as  to  why  a  videotape 
referred  to  in  paragraph  (a)  could  not  be  made,  there  is 
available  to  the  court  a  videotape  of  an  interview  with  the 
accused  person  about  the  making  and  terms  of  the 
confession or admission or the substance of the confession 
or  admission  in  the  course  of  which  the  accused  person 
states that he or she made a confession or an admission in 
those  terms  or  confirms  the  substance  of  the  admission  or 
confession; or 

the  prosecution  proves  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that 
there was a reasonable explanation as to why the videotape 
referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) could not be made; or

How did the impugned statement come to be made? 
 
On 22 November 1999 the appellant, who had already been interviewed 
 
more than once about the victim's death, was interviewed by Detective Sergeant 
Lopes, Detective Allen and Detective Pretyman about a robbery that took place 
in 1991.  The latter officer went away to look for the custody sergeant, and in her 
absence a discussion between Detective Sergeant Lopes, Detective Allen and the 
appellant took place.  Detective Sergeant Lopes said that Marlow was going to be 
charged with the murder of the victim and there was a chance that the appellant 
could be charged also.  They then discussed whether the appellant might receive 
an ""indemnity"" for cooperating with the police.  On Detective Pretyman's return, 
the appellant was charged with the 1991 robbery and remanded in custody. 
 
 
On 25 November 1999 Detective Sergeant Lopes and Detective Pretyman 
took the appellant into a police interview room in a city building in Hobart, but 
the appellant said he wanted to talk in the open air.  Those officers and Inspector 
Little then accompanied the appellant to the roof.  There the appellant admitted 
that he and Marlow, but not  Williams, were  involved in  murdering the victim, 
and raised the subject of an indemnity.  While Detective Sergeant Lopes and the 
appellant  waited  on  the  roof  for  the  appellant's  wife  to  arrive,  the  appellant 
requested an indemnity and bail.  Thereafter the appellant said he did not wish to 
take part in a video-recorded interview, but he did write out a statement in his 
own hand describing how he assisted Marlow by telling him how to get access to, 
and to use, the excavator.   
 
 
On 4 March 2000 the appellant was at liberty, having been granted bail on 
the robbery charge.  He was then arrested on a charge of murdering the victim 
and taken to Launceston, where a video-recorded interview took place.  Including 
breaks, it lasted from  5.57pm to 9.17pm.  In that interview Detective Sergeant 
Lopes  and  Detective  Pretyman  reminded  the  appellant  of  the  statement  he  had 
made on 25 November 1999.   
 
 
The appellant contended that he had made the statements only because of 
police threats that if the statements were not made the appellant would be denied 
bail and every effort would be made to ""stitch him up"" on a charge of murdering

the  victim,  because  he  felt  the  need  to  obtain  bail  so  that  he  could  protect  his 
family  from  a  criminal  named  Jarvis  and  because  of  pressure  placed  on  his 
family.    Detective  Sergeant  Lopes  denied  these  contentions.    After  much 
questioning on these subjects, and on various circumstantial connections between 
the appellant and the victim's death, the interview concluded as follows:   
 

""ML  And so you're saying you've got no involvement in it whatsoever? 

SK    No, no, I haven't got any involvement in it whatsoever. 

ML    But in a matter of approximately three and a half months ago you 

told me that you and Marlow were involved in it. 

SK    Yeah, and I told you why, you know why. 

ML    Well I, I don't know why you've told me that and now you're saying 

to me that you don't know anything about it. 

SK  You know why I've done it. 

ML  

Is there anything else you want to ask? 

AP  No. 

14 

ML  Are you happy about the way you've been treated today? 

SK  Yeah no complaints. 

ML  Right,  in  that  case  then  we'll  conclude  the  interview  and  it's 

approximately 9.17pm."" 

 
The  appellant  then  made  some  telephone  calls.    He  was  charged, 
fingerprinted  and  photographed.    It  was  then  proposed  that  he  be  taken  to  the 
Launceston General Hospital for the purpose of obtaining samples of blood and 
hair.  Just before the appellant and accompanying officers got into the car, the 
appellant  made  the  impugned  statement.    He  said,  according  to  Detective 
Sergeant Lopes and Detective Pretyman:   
 

""Sorry about the interview â€“ no hard feelings, I was just playing the game.  
I suppose I shouldn't have said that, I suppose you will make notes of that 
as well."" 

The police officers did not respond to this statement.  They made no note of it.  
They also did  not attempt to return the appellant to the interview room with  a 
view to making a video-recording of the appellant repeating what he had said so 
as  to  attract  s  8(2)(b)  of  the  Act.    Detective  Sergeant  Lopes  thought  the
--------

appellant's statement was made thirty to forty minutes after the video-recording 
had  ceased  and  the  appellant  had  left  the  video  interview  room;  Detective 
Pretyman thought it took place nearly an hour after those events.  
 
The fate of the appellant's objection 
 
 
The  reception  of  the  appellant's  impugned  statement  was  objected  to  at 
trial.  The trial judge overruled the objection on the ground that the statement was 
not made in the course of official questioning.  In the course of his summing-up 
the trial judge warned the jury about the disadvantages which the accused faced, 
the potential unreliability of the evidence, and the need to scrutinise the evidence 
of the statement with care.   
 
 
On appeal no complaint was made about these directions of the trial judge.  
The  sole  complaint  on  appeal  was  that  the  statement  should  not  have  been 
admitted.   
 
 
A majority (Underwood J, Evans J concurring) of the Court of Criminal 
Appeal  agreed  with  the  trial  judge's  reasoning.    Underwood  J  found  that  the 
impugned statement was not made in the course of official questioning, because 
all questioning had ceased by the time the appellant had left the video interview 
room.  His Honour said3:   
 

""The  plain  fact  in  this  case  is  that  the  impugned  admission  was 
volunteered  by  the  appellant  â€¦  and  was  not  made  in  the  course  of  any 
questioning at all.  The questioning had clearly come to an end at the time 
the appellant â€¦ left the video interview room and set off for the charge 
room.    The  evidence  was  that  no  other  question  was  asked  of  him  by 
Detective Lopes or Detective Pretyman thereafter.  It would be straining 
the  language  of  the  legislature  to  hold  that  â€¦  the  course  of  official 
questioning  was  still  in  progress  when  the  impugned  admission  was 
made."" 

 
Slicer  J,  on  the  other  hand,  construed  s  8  of  the  Act  as  conferring  a 
protection  which  was  ""temporal,  encompassing  events  (including  statements 
against interest) occurring whilst a person is in custody4"".  He therefore disagreed 
with the majority, but he joined in the order dismissing the appeal on the ground 
that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred:  Criminal Code 
(Tas), s 402(2).

The one material issue in this case was whether the impugned statement 

 
 
Immaterial issues 
 
 
was ""made in the course of official questioning"".   
 
 
No attempt was made to contend in this Court or the courts below that any 
of  the  possibly  applicable  exceptions  referred  to  in  ss  8(2)(b)-(d)  of  the  Act 
applied; hence it is not necessary to consider them, save to the extent that they 
may  throw  light  on  what  the  expression  ""made  in  the  course  of  official 
questioning"" means.   
 
 
One other potential controversy may be excluded from consideration.  The 
trial  judge  had  entertained  doubt  whether  the  impugned  statement  was  a 
""confession or admission"", on the ground that it was not an admission of guilt, 
but only an admission of making false allegations against the police in the video-
recorded interview.  In the course of argument in this Court a question was raised 
as to whether that doubt was soundly based.  There is a debate as to whether the 
expression ""confession or admission"" includes, in addition to statements which 
are apparently intended to be inculpatory, those which are apparently intended to 
be exculpatory5.  The point is important not only in various legislative contexts, 
but also in relation to the common law voluntariness rules6.  If it is possible that 
an exculpatory statement can be characterised as an admission, it is also possible 
that the impugned statement, which is not in terms inculpatory but which casts 
doubt on the exculpatory explanations offered during the video-recorded part of 
the interview of 4 March 2000 to account for the making of the confession of 25 
November 1999, can also be characterised as an admission.  Since this important 
point was not argued in the Court of Criminal Appeal or in this Court however, 
and since the appeal fails on other grounds, it is undesirable to decide it one way 
or the other. 
 

                                                                                                                                     
5   The view that it is is supported by such cases as R v Raso (1993) 115 FLR 319 at 
346 per Ormiston J and R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 at 437 per Wood CJ at 
CL (Sully and Ireland JJ concurring); support for the contrary view can be found in 
such  cases  as  R  v  Arnol  (1997)  6  Tas  R  374  at  382  per  Zeeman  J  and  R  v  GH 
(2000) 105 FCR 419 at 422-425 [14]-[22] per Spender J.

The problem of confessions to the police 
 
 
Though for many years before the 1960s legal rules had been developed in 
some detail to regulate the proof of confessions to police officers, from the 1960s 
on  concern  about  that  topic  increased.    The  key  questions,  from  case  to  case, 
were whether a confession was made; if so, in what terms; whether it was to be 
excluded as involuntary; whether it was to be excluded in the court's discretion 
either as having been obtained unfairly, or as having been obtained illegally or 
improperly; and whether it was reliable.  All these issues were capable of being 
affected  by  the  means  by  which  the  confession  was  perceived,  recorded  or 
recollected, and then transmitted to the court.   
 
 
in Driscoll v The Queen, Gibbs J said7: 
 

Particular concern was directed to allegedly fabricated confessions.  Thus 

""It is very common for an accused person to deny that he made an oral 
confession which police witnesses swear that he made.  The accused has 
an obvious motive to claim that police testimony of this kind is false.  On 
the other hand it would be unreal to imagine that every police officer in 
every case is too  scrupulous to succumb to  the temptation to  attempt to 
secure the conviction of a person whom he believes to be guilty by saying 
that he has confessed to the crime with which he is charged when in fact 
he has not done so."" 

Disputes could arise in circumstances including the following: 

But the problem went well beyond possible fabrication. 
 
 
 
(a)  where an oral confession was not noted down; 
 
(b)  where  an  oral  confession  was  noted  down,  whether  contemporaneously 
(for example, by a police typist laboriously recording each question and 
answer) or otherwise, and whether by a single police officer, or by two or 
more police officers acting separately or collaboratively; 

 
(c)  where  an  oral  confession  was  reduced  to  writing  but  not  signed  by  its 

maker; 

 
(d)  where an oral confession was reduced to writing by police officers before 

being signed by its maker; and

(e)  where a confession was written out by its maker. 
 
 
The disputes could turn on questions not only of fabrication, but also of 
misunderstanding,  misrecollection,  coercion,  or  oppression  in  a  broad  sense.  
Considerable amounts of court time were taken up, generally in the absence of 
the jury, in resolving disputes about confessions.  Considerable amounts of police 
time,  too,  were  taken  up  in  interviews  slowly  recorded  by  officers  operating 
typewriters  or  writing  in  notebooks.    Grave  allegations  were  commonly  made 
suggesting  police  perjury,  brutality  and  pressure.    Unfounded  though  many  of 
these allegations may have been, they were damaging to public confidence in the 
criminal  justice  system.    Over  time  the  courts,  law  reform  agencies  and 
legislatures  began  to  respond  to  this  state  of  affairs.    In  particular,  as  audio 
recording  became  more  common  in  commercial  and  social  life,  and  as  the 
necessary  equipment  became  more  efficient,  easier  to  operate,  and  cheaper,  it 
was  increasingly  suggested  that,  either  as  a  matter  of  sensible  practice  or  as  a 
precondition to admissibility, police interviews in criminal investigations should 
be  electronically  recorded.    Pilot  studies  were  conducted  which  suggested  the 
utility of this technique.  It was hoped that the introduction of a reliable means of 
recording  confessions  would  not  only  save  police  and  court  time  directly,  and 
reduce  the  need  for  police  officers  to  spend  long  periods  at  court,  but  also 
encourage more, and earlier, pleas of guilty.  All this would save public money as 
well  as  improving  the  integrity  of  the  trial  process  and  the  efficiency  of  the 
police.   
 
 
There were suggestions of this kind by members of this Court.  Thus in a 
case in which the police said that they had recorded a confession in a document 
composed  by  typing  out  their  questions  and  the  accused's  answers,  and  the 
accused had refused to sign it, Murphy J observed8: 
 

""The  liberty  of  the  accused,  the  reputation  of  the  police  and  the 
proper  administration  of  justice  are  jeopardised  by  the  failure,  where 
opportunity  permits,  to  provide  a  more  independent  record  of  police 
questioning."" 

In Driscoll v The Queen, another case involving an unsigned record of interview, 
Gibbs J (Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ concurring) said9:

are other methods, such as tape recording, or the use of video-tape, which 
would  be  likely  to  be  more  effective  than  the  production  of  unsigned 
records of interview, and would not be open to the same objection.""

This  Court  decided  that  the  following  matters  were  relevant  to  the 
question of whether alleged admissions were in fact made:  attempts by police 
officers to prevent a solicitor getting in touch with a client held for questioning, 
refusals  by  them  to  allow  a  solicitor  to  be  present  during  questioning,  and  a 
failure to serve a copy of a record of interview on an accused person as soon as 
practicable after it was made (because it gives rise to a suspicion that the record 
may  have  been  altered)10.    These  matters  were  also  relevant  to  a  discretion  to 
exclude the evidence on grounds of unfairness11.  A written record of interview 
was held to be admissible if in the accused's handwriting or acknowledged by the 
accused in the presence of some impartial person12 or if otherwise adopted by the 
accused13 though there was a discretion to exclude it on grounds of unfairness14.  
Where a written record of interview was neither signed nor otherwise adopted, it 
was held to be not itself admissible, though the officers who prepared it might 
refresh  their  memory  from  it15.    More  recently,  in  McKinney  v  The  Queen16  a 
majority  of  this  Court  held  that  the  jury  should  be  instructed  to  give  careful 
consideration  to  the  dangers  involved  in  convicting  an  accused  person  in 
circumstances  where  the  only  (or  substantially  the  only)  basis  for  finding  that

guilt  has  been  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt  is  a  confession  allegedly 
made in police custody, unless its making has been reliably corroborated17.  This 
conclusion  was  reached  after  the  practice  of  recording  police  interviews  had 
begun  to  grow,  and  an  audiovisual  recording  was  seen  as  one  type  of  reliable 
corroboration18.   
 
 
Simultaneously  with  the  judicial  development  of  these  principles,  law 
reform agencies and commissions of inquiry began responding to the problem.  
Thus in 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended19: 
 

""Interviews should preferably be (a) recorded by mechanical means or (b) 
corroborated by a third person and, if these measures are not practicable in 
the  circumstances,  (c)  checked  by  a  third  person  after  being  reduced  to 
writing, or at least (d) reduced to writing and signed by the accused."" 

Both in the United Kingdom and Australia, numerous other bodies recommended 
that  the  admissibility  of  confessions  to  police  should,  in  general,  depend  on 
whether they had been tape-recorded20. 
 
 
As a result, it came to be viewed as a commonplace, not only in circles 
favourable to defence interests but also in police circles, that, despite its financial 
cost, the electronic recording of police interviews, particularly video-recording, 
would  generate  real  advantages.    It  would  be  useful  in  providing  a  means  of 
establishing exactly what was said; in proving that requirements for cautioning

and  other  formalities  had  been  complied  with;  in  narrowing  the  time  within 
which it could be alleged that threats had been made; in helping to estimate the

confessions of all, or only some, crimes should be recorded, and which particular 
exceptions to any general prohibition of non-recorded confessions should exist, 
the following are among the possibilities which arose.

require that no confession to a police officer be admitted unless video-recorded â€“ 
whether  or  not  the  maker  was  in  custody;  whether  or  not  the  maker  was 
suspected, or ought reasonably to have been suspected, of committing the crime 
confessed; and whether or not the maker had been asked any question by a police 
officer.  This approach has attracted no significant support, and it has not been 
followed by any Australian legislature21.

2757589,R v RM [2011] NSWSC 861,"Judgment 

1The accused is charged with the murder of her son, BM, on 24 August 2009. The trial of the accused has proceeded as a trial by judge alone after the accused made an election pursuant to s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to be tried in that fashion. The accused indicated that she had received advice from her solicitor before making the election and the Crown indicated its consent to the matter taking the course which was proposed. Section 133 of the Act casts certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict in such a trial. I have had regard to those obligations: Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. 

2It is common ground that the accused killed the deceased with the requisite intention to constitute the offence of murder. Accordingly, the only issue which I have to determine is whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the killing. Even upon that issue the evidence is all one way and the parties are in agreement that I should find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. 

Background to the fatal incident 

3The accused, who is aged 34, and her former de facto partner of five (5) years, DW, are the natural parents of BM who was 17 months old at the time of his death. The accused gave birth to BM by way of emergency c-section at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, on 18 March 2008. He was a healthy child at birth and remained in good health until his death. He was their only child. Although the couple resided together, it appears that for some time they had done so for the sake of their child. Indeed at the relevant time they were occupying separate bedrooms. 

4The accused was a practising psychologist, having graduated from the University of New England. She remained in practice until 2006, at which time she was the subject of a complaint to the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) by one of her former patients, as a result of which she was de-registered in 2008. 

5The police investigation shows that as a child the accused was exposed to sexually inappropriate behaviour by her step-father and her mother. She reported that her step-father was violent and that he made frequent threats to kill himself. The accused's medical records show that she has suffered from mental health issues, particularly anxiety, since her teenage years. The first recorded incident of a panic attack in which medical attention was sought was in 1992 when she was 15. I have been provided with a great deal of material which addresses those issues. Although I have had regard to it, it is unnecessary to refer to every aspect of it. The medical records link her mental health problems to her history of abuse as a child. 

6The accused has been hospitalised on two occasions after taking an overdose of prescribed medications. The first occasion was in May 2004. Her GP, Dr Bailey, reported that the accused was suffering from severe depression, anxiety and panic disorder and had attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs that had been prescribed for her. Dr Bailey arranged a referral to Dr Timothy McDonald, Consultant Psychiatrist. 

7In a report dated 4 June 2004, Dr McDonald observed that: 

[RM] gave a history of longstanding anxiety from childhood, which crystallised into panic attacks from the age of fifteen. She describes classic panic attacks, but no agoraphobic response. In her adult years the tendency has been for the anxiety to become more pervasive and severe. She has been in intensive psychotherapy, dealing with early childhood traumas, but this has not helped stem the flow of panic. 

8A week prior to that admission the accused was upset and crying and told her sister ""that I don't want to be scared anymore"". 

9The second occasion occurred in March 2007 when she was hospitalised for more than a fortnight. She was found to be mentally ill and was detained as a temporary patient. Her medical notes reveal that she experienced ""mood congruent auditory hallucinations"". For nearly three weeks prior to this admission, she reported having heard music which she interpreted as ""time to go"" and having heard voices (mumbling) talking about her. 

10Between 2006 and 2009 the accused had conversations with various people which revealed something of her deteriorating state of mind. For example, DW told police that the accused had battled with anxiety and panic attacks and depression. He noted that her anxiety made her fear things that sometimes were not there. He also informed police that ""something (played) on her mind...like, dark stuff, like things out to get her"". 

11Sharan Taylor first met the accused in 2005/6. They were both working in a healing centre in Cessnock. Several months after they met, the accused told Ms Taylor that she was ""soul mates"" with Eddie Van Halen (a member of the rock group Van Halen) and that he had tricked her by falsely claiming that he was coming to pick her up. 

12Another acquaintance, KG, reported that the accused was ""dealing with things such as aliens, past lives, foreign spirits and other 'weird' phenomena"" and that her behaviour was ""unusual and erratic"". KG said that the accused believed that there was a spaceship that shone a blue light onto her house which protected her and gave her energy. 

13According to her sister, the accused ""really started being weird"" at around about the time she commenced working at the healing centre. For instance, the accused claimed that she was seeing and communicating with dead people; that she was communicating telepathically with a friend of hers and with her sister's cat; that she was seeing ""signs"" and on one occasion that she was communicating with Eddie Van Halen to try and help him get off drugs. The accused's sister commented that ""you'd talk to her and it's like you were talking to three different people at once"". The accused's brother noticed similar behaviour. 

14CC, who had been the accused's partner for many years until they separated in 2006, noticed changes in the accused about the time that she commenced work in the healing centre. He said that in May 2006 the accused began to develop an obsession with the band Van Halen. On one occasion CC saw the accused listening to very loud Van Halen music through headphones. The accused told CC that she was ""listening for the message...the message that Eddie had encoded for me"". The accused also told him about a ""Reptilian Human Conspiracy Theory"" and told him that ""reptilians"" exist in positions of power around the world. 

15Deborah Horsey met the accused in mid 2008. The accused told her that UFOs were hovering over her house and that she had to get away. She said that they were attacking both her and BM. The accused also told her that she heard voices in her head and on one occasion she told Ms Horsey about ""reptilian aliens"". 

16On 9 October 2008 the accused told a long time friend, Brett Stone, that she had aerial surveillance because of a threat upon her life. As they were chatting outside, a light aircraft flew overhead. The accused told Mr Stone ""there are my boys overhead in the plane. Let's just give them a wave so they know I am OK"". The accused asserted that the threat to her life and to BM emanated from the former patient who had lodged a complaint with the HCCC. In an email to Mr Stone dated 4 October 2008 the accused wrote, inter alia, ""...current intel indicates that my former patient is still on the loose & out for blood - she's intelligent, psychotic & is a qualified private investigator - a lethal mix..."" 

17In August 2009 the accused met Andre Coppenrath and they shared some of their personal experiences with UFOs. The accused told Coppenrath that there was a mothercraft over her house and that she was scared of the ""reptiles"". She said that she was worried about them getting into her head and taking her away. She said that she was also worried about what they might do to BM. 

18On the day of the offence, DW was picked up from home by a colleague at about 6.00am. BM was awake at that time and was apparently in good spirits. The accused was also awake. After work, DW along with a number of co-workers, attended a local club before arriving home at about 6.00pm. On his arrival he heard what he believed to be the sound of the accused snoring in her room. He assumed that BM was asleep in his cot. He watched television for about an hour and then proceeded to prepare a bottle of formula for BM. Upon entering the bedroom with the bottle he peered into the cot and noticed a piece of paper across the chest of BM. The note read, ""I am sorry I had to protect [ BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me "". DW noticed that BM was cold to touch and that he was stiff. 

19DW went into the accused's bedroom and screamed at her to get up. The accused, after some delay, got out of bed but was both incoherent and completely disorientated. DW, in anger, punched the accused's bedroom door a number of times, causing minor injuries to his hands. He also head- butted the wall. According to DW, the accused seemed to be scared of something. She was slurring her words. He said that she told him that something was after her. The accused went to the kitchen where she sat on the floor before lapsing into a state of unconsciousness. DW contacted emergency services and an ambulance officer arrived shortly afterwards. He examined BM and formed the view that he had been dead for some hours. The accused was conveyed under police guard to Wyong Hospital in an unconscious state. 

20A large number of empty blister packs of various prescription medications were located in the kitchen waste bin. These packs were collected by ambulance officers and taken to Wyong Hospital to assist with the treatment of the accused. A blood sample taken from the accused at 11.00 pm revealed the presence of codeine, alprazolam, promethazine and mirtazapine . A urine toxicological screen indicated a positive result for benzodiazepines and opiates. Dr Judith Perl, forensic pharmacologist, expressed the opinion that: 

In summary, there does not appear to be any indication of an overdose resulting in life-threatening effects of any particular medication used by [RM]. However, there is an indication that her higher than expected blood levels were due to higher than prescribed doses of mirtazapine and alprazolam having been used. This would have resulted in some of the symptoms observed in her after the incident and these suggest impairment of her cognitive and motor functions due to the sedative nature of these drugs. Some symptoms also appear to be due to her mental illness, but I cannot elaborate further on this area as it is not my field of expertise. 

21When the accused became coherent, police spoke with her at the hospital at 8.10am on 25 August. The accused was informed that she was under arrest and was cautioned. She remained under police guard until a medical and psychiatric release could be obtained . 

22Shortly after 1 pm that afternoon, police investigators attended the hospital after being informed that the accused was cleared for release pending a psychiatric evaluation. Upon their arrival, police were given an evaluation of the accused which had been conducted by a psychiatrist and two psychiatric registrars. During the course of the evaluation the accused said that she had suffocated BM. She had then written a note and blessed the child before taking an overdose of medication. She said that she wanted to die and that she expected to do so from the overdose. She said, ""Absolutely, it was wrong....I'm the one who fucked up everything and killed my son"". She was tearful and expressed remorse. During the evaluation she reported a four year history of delusions, perceptual disturbances and passivity phenomena. She said that she believed that ""reptilians"" had come to earth from space, mocking her and giving her commands to kill herself and that she was being controlled by them. She explained that this phenomenon had developed over the previous three months and that she had become increasingly worried about her son's safety. She said that she thought that her son would be safer from the ""reptilians"" in heaven. 

23During the evaluation the accused appeared to dissociate for brief periods of time. She reported seeing and hearing ""reptilians"" and experiencing physical sensations when they were near. In their joint report, the consultant psychiatrist and the two psychiatric registrars opined that the accused was mentally ill. They said that she presented with a psychotic illness, which was most probably related to paranoid schizophrenia. She also had a co-morbid Major Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Upon being placed under arrest the accused told detectives, that ""I deserve to be punished for what I've done"". The accused was conveyed to The Entrance Police Station and after being entered into custody, she agreed to be interviewed. During the interview the accused told police that she had killed her son because she did not want him to suffer in this world. She also said ""I've got nothing to hide. I'm guilty."" When asked why she was protecting her son, she said ""Please, I don't want to go there, I can't talk about it any more"". Her answers were lucid and concise although she did state that her son was a product of an immaculate conception and that his father was God. 

24She told police that she had ingested about a half a handful of her medication which included Avanza (an antidepressant) and Xanax (for anxiety). She then became distressed and declined to be interviewed any further. In a subsequent unrecorded interview with police, the accused admitted suffocating BM by using her hands and two white face washers whilst he was on the lounge room floor. Two face washers were found on a cabinet next to the entrance to the lounge room. There is no suggestion that the accused harmed the child in any way prior to this event. 

25The accused, who has no prior criminal history, has remained in custody since her arrest. On 23 June 2010 she waived her right to a committal hearing and was committed to this Court for arraignment. 

The psychiatric evidence concerning the accused's mental condition 

26Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a report, dated 28 October 2009, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of schizophrenia in the form of auditory hallucinations of several years' duration, giving rise to bizarre delusional beliefs. [RM's] presentation was also typical of a person with an undertreated schizophrenic illness in that she had a very blunted emotional range, appeared distracted as though experiencing auditory hallucinations during the interview, expressed the bizarre belief that I would be in danger if she disclosed the presence of symptoms to me. 

There was characteristic ambivalence in her attitude to her symptoms in that she agreed that her training should have enabled her to consider the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but also seemed compelled to obey the voices and to hold the belief that her son was better off dead because of the fate that he would have faced had she not killed him. 

[RM's] depressive illness appears to be secondary to the effect of very distressing psychotic symptoms, rather than her psychotic symptoms being a manifestation of severe depression. 

Consideration was given to the possibility that [RM] had drawn on her experience as a psychologist working in community mental health to fabricate her symptoms. However, her account of symptoms was thought to be consistent with the presence of severe mental illness and I expect the medical records from James Fletcher Hospital and other corroborative information will confirm the pattern of symptoms. 

There was no history of brain injury or substance abuse. 

Based on the information available and her presentation at the recent interview, I believe [RM] has the defence of mental illness open to her. She has a severe psychotic illness, probably schizophrenia, that gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the bizarre delusional belief that she and her son were in danger of a tormenting death in the hands of Alien creatures. 

Her illness did not deprive her of the knowledge of the nature or quality of her act which is reflected in her statements to the police afterwards or that the act was illegal. The effect of delusional beliefs arising from ongoing symptoms was to deprive her of the knowledge that killing her son was morally wrong. 

27Dr Richard Furst also prepared a report, dated 20 June 2010, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

There is well established history of anxiety with panic attacks for which she has been treated over several years with antidepressant medication and Xanax. 

Her clinical history is highly suggestive of a severe disturbance of mood in the form of a Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic symptoms, however the persistence of her delusional beliefs about aliens and various other psychotic phenomena over the last nine months now makes it more likely that she is suffering from a major psychotic illness best classified as Schizoaffective Disorder. She may also have an underlying personality disorder with Borderline features. ... 

In the case of [RM], she was suffering from a psychotic illness at the time in question that was characterised by multiple experiences of hearing and seeing alien figures she called 'reptilians' who she took to be an evil and dark presence over her house. She described increased worry and panic attacks in the period preceding the index offence, felt down and saw an alien ship blocking out the sun. She remembers that it was ""really dark"" and that she experienced nightmares. She told me that she would walk from one room of the house to another and that ""it was like it had been taken over by darkness...it looked darker."" She thought that this dark presence was due to the Reptilians and burnt incense and candle to try and get rid of them. 

She believed that both she and [BM] were being overcome by the reptilians, in that [BM] had changed his appearance, including his facial features and his eye colour. This description is consistent with a Capgras delusion (delusion of imposters), which reinforced her belief that the Reptilians were sucking his soul out and changing him into something else she referred to as a 'Changeling'. It is highly likely that she was panicking about [BM's] safety, as she heard the 'Reptilians' making hissing noises saying ""we're going to get him"". 

Although she could not recall killing [BM] when I interviewed her, there was a verbatim account of a highly emotional, thought disordered and psychotic nature on the morning after the index offence that is outlined in the statements of Dr Minoka Galappaththi and Dr Pashu that included the following exchanges: 

Dr Pashu: Who is [BM]? The accused: ""My son [BM...17 months old...over and over they told me that I need to kill [BM]...he needed to go to heaven."" 
Dr Pashu...What happened to [BM]? 
The accused: ""They are coming and going...'just kill the child and kill yourself'...that's the only way to end the suffering ""I killed him...suffocated him...I think it was the last evening'...I just can't see how I could have done it...may be it's wrong."" 

These responses indicate that [RM] was aware of her actions at the time in question and felt compelled to do this because she was being commanded to by the 'reptilians' and saw no real alternative to end her suffering and the suffering and attack she perceived [BM] to be under. Her act of placing a note on her son's 
body that said ""I am sorry I had to protect [BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me"" also illustrates her mens rea at the time in question, which led to her killing [BM] and trying to kill herself. 

Although the question of her mental illness at the time of the index offence is a matter for the trier of fact, she was clearly delusional about the victim, perceiving that he was under attack from the reptilians and that his soul was in danger. It is highly likely that her delusions were a product of her schizoaffective disorder, an illness that has been recognised in law as a disease of the mind. In my opinion, her psychotic symptoms deprived her of the ability to appreciate the moral wrongfulness of her actions in killing [BM] and stopped her from reasoning about her actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure. I believe that she has the mental illness defence open to her. 

28Dr Allnutt prepared a report, dated 2 November 2010, at the request of the Crown's legal representatives. He concluded: 

I am however more inclined to accept that she suffered panic attacks for many years and that in the material time leading up to the alleged offences, she was likely suffering depressive symptoms; and as a result , despite my misgivings, I am prepared to conclude that she suffered from, what in legal terms could be regarded as ""disease of the mind"" or an ""underlying condition"", due to a depression and anxiety. ... 

If the court accepts that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence - that is, that she rationalised that she should kill the child because it was in his interest and that she acted with delusional justification - the court could conclude that she was incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of her actions and that she has a mental illness defence because she would have been significantly compromised in that capacity. 

If the court does not accept that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence, but accepts she was suffering a depression with anxiety, then there are grounds to consider that she was to some lesser degree compromised in her capacity to know the wrongfulness of her actions and the (sic) could consider a defence of mental illness. 

29After having been provided with further material Dr Allnutt observed, in a subsequent report, dated 28 March 2011: 

Having regard to that ""timeline"", there is evidence of interest in crystals, Reiki, subliminal messages, commencing October 1987, with evidence of anxiety in the early 1990s and continuing; there appear to be changes occurring in her behaviour in early 2006...it is noted that she started saying ""weird stuff"" like she could see dead people, communicate them (sic), help people transition through death, that she communicates telepathically with a friend and a cat, and sees signs in things like number plates. 

These are symptoms that are consistent with psychosis that seem to emerge at a time where there is little evidence for underlying motive for fabrication or exaggeration, and I regard this as significant. 

While I continue to believe that her presentation is atypical, I accept that it is likely that she suffered psychosis at the material time that the alleged offence (sic). 

My opinion in regard to the defence available to her is explained in my report; that is, depending on how the court interprets the evidence she would be eligible for a defence of mental illness or substantial impairment. 

30To establish the defence of mental illness the accused must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time of the killing she was suffering from such a defect of reasoning arising from a disease of the mind that she did not know the nature and quality of what she was doing, or alternatively if she did know it, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong (the M'Naghten test). It is the second limb of that test which is of particular significance in the present case. That requirement was described in the following terms by Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182: 

The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. (at 189-90) 

See also Stapleton v R (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367. 

31It is to be observed that the opinions of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, particularly in those passages to which I have referred, are directed to the test which I am bound to apply. In light of the evidence which I have set out, which includes the various utterances and actions of the accused at the relevant time, as well as her lengthy history of mental illness, I have no hesitation in accepting the opinions of those experts, each of whom is eminently qualified in the area of forensic psychiatry. 

32I accept the submission made by each of the parties that the accused has established upon the balance of probabilities that she did not know, in the relevant sense, that what she was doing was wrong, and that therefore she was mentally ill at the time she killed the deceased. It is axiomatic that a person who is found to be mentally ill cannot be held criminally responsible for his or her actions. 

Order 

33In accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) I find the accused not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness. In doing so I have had regard, pursuant to s 37 of the Act, to the practical and legal consequences of that finding. See R v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 per Hall J [at para 69-79]. I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Act, in the custody of Corrective Services NSW until released by due process of law. The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by the court. I direct that the various reports of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and of Dr Allnutt be drawn to the attention of Justice Health. 

34Finally, I would like to take the opportunity of extending my sympathy to the family of the deceased, who undoubtedly have been deeply affected by this tragic event.

      Regina v David John PARKER 
      
      
       
      
     On 17 March 2000 the appellant pleaded guilty to five counts of offences against ss24(2) and 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). The offences were committed between December 1995 and September 1997.  
      
       
     Count 1 was for knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity and the appellant was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. Counts 2, 4 and 5 related to knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity. Sentences of fixed terms of 6 years, 7 years and 7 years imprisonment respectively were imposed for these counts, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Count 3 was not raised in the appeal. 
      
       
     The sentencing Judge found that the appellant had played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. He was not merely a courier of drugs and a main part of his role involved storing and transporting drugs. 
      
       
     The appellant applied to change his pleas of guilty to pleas of not guilty on counts 2, 4 and 5. He also appealed against the severity of sentence on count 1. 
      
       
     The appeal concerned the meaning of the phrase ""step â€¦ in the process â€¦ of manufacture"" in s6 of the Act. The appellant argued that the pleas of guilty should be reopened because of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v BD [2001] NSWCCA 184 and R v McCoy [2001] NSWCCA 255, both given after the appellant was sentenced.  
      
       
     In respect of count 2 the sentencing Judge had found that the only physical act in which the appellant seemed to be involved was the popping of Sudafed tablets from their blister packs. The appellant submitted that in light of the decision in R v BD, it was not a fact capable in law of founding his conviction. Similarly, the sentencing Judge's statements that there was no evidence that the appellant actually himself participated in any of the cooking operations and that his role was in assisting in getting the chemicals together for the purposes of the exercise meant that on the same principle there was no foundation for a finding of his guilt on counts 4 and 5. There was evidence that the appellant had been advised to plead guilty by his legal advisers because of their belief that these preparatory activities were steps in the manufacture. 
      
       
     Further, in relation to counts 4 and 5, the appellant argued that the evidence established that because of the poor quality of the raw materials it would have been impossible for large commercial quantities of methylamphetamine to be produced: R v McCoy. The offences were incapable of being committed by the appellant in the manner alleged and as such his convictions were not capable in law of being sustained.  
      
       
     The Crown conceded that the length of the sentence imposed for count 1 was excessive and demonstrated a sentencing structure which did not accord with the principles established by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. However it was argued that the totality of the sentences should not be disturbed. 
      
       
        
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Hidden J and Howie J concurring):Change of Pleas 
      
       
     1. The appellant's pleas of guilty constituted an admission of the essential elements of the offences charged. The pleas must be considered final subject only to the sentencing Judge's discretion to grant leave to change the plea before the matter is disposed of by sentence; Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. Before an appellant should be permitted to reopen his pleas of guilty he must demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice had occurred; see the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453. 
      
       
     2. It is clear that the conduct of the appellant in removing the Sudafed tablets from their plastic containers which founded count 2 was with the view to using the tablets in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. R v BD should not be treated as determining that a person removing Sudafed or similar tablets from their containers with the intention of using the contents to manufacture methylamphetamine can never be said to be taking a step in the process of manufacture of methylamphetamine: see Kouroumalos and Thomas v R (1993) 67 A Crim R 308. 
      
       
     3. R v McCoy is distinguished on the basis that despite the extent of the period encompassed by the charge, the matter was put to the jury on the basis of activities being carried on at, and just prior to, the appellant's arrest. In this case counts 4 and 5 related to a period of over 12 months. The sentencing Judge correctly concluded that the appellant played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. 
      
       
     Sentence 
      
       
     4. The sentence for count 1 was excessive and should be quashed. The Court re-sentenced the appellant to 9 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     5. In approaching each offence separately and fixing an appropriate sentence for that offence, the question of whether the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative or partially cumulative must take account of the totality of the sentence for all the offences charged. In this case it is appropriate that the sentences are partially cumulative.

     1 SHELLER JA 
      
       
        
       Introduction 
        
         
        
       On 17 March 2000, the appellant, David John Parker, pleaded guilty before Judge Woods QC to five counts of offences against ss24(2) and 25(1) and (2) of the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        1985 (the Act), which can conveniently be called counts 1 to 5. The first three counts were in an indictment dated 10 December 1999 and the remaining two in an indictment dated 19 October 1999.  
        
       
     2 The first count was for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 30 July and 20 September 1997. The second count was for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount which was not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 20 January and 30 September 1997. The third count was for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, commonly known as ecstasy, between 20 January and 17 June 1997. The fourth count was for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 1 December 1995 and 31 January 1997 and the fifth count for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the same drug in an amount not less than the applicable large commercial quantity between 1 December 1995 and 30 June 1996. In the first count the supply was alleged to have taken place at Wahroonga. In the second and third counts the manufacturing and supply were alleged to have taken place at Kariong in New South Wales. In the fourth and fifth counts the manufacturing was alleged to have taken place at Sydney. 
      
       
     3 The sentences imposed by Judge Woods were on the first count imprisonment for 13 years with a minimum term of 10 years; on the second count a fixed term of 6 years imprisonment; on the third count a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment; on the fourth count a fixed term of 7 years imprisonment and on the fifth count a fixed term of 7 years imprisonment. The terms were to be served concurrently commencing from 10 November 1999. On the first count the sentencing Judge took into account an offence on a Form 1 of supplying the prohibited drug, amphetamine, being an amount not less than the applicable commercial quantity on 16 September 1998 at Rockdale, while the appellant was released on bail.  
      
       
     4 This appeal concerns in part the meaning of the phrase â€œstep â€¦ in the process of â€¦ manufactureâ€ in s6 of the Act. Relevantly s6 of the Act provides that: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œ[A] person takes part in â€¦ the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug if: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that â€¦ manufacture, production or supply.â€ 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     5 The appellant applies to change his pleas of guilty to pleas of not guilty on the second, fourth and fifth counts and appeals against the severity of sentence on the first count. The appellant does not challenge the conviction or sentence imposed on the third count or the sentences imposed on the second, fourth or fifth counts. 
      
       
        
       Remarks on sentence 
        
       
     6 In his remarks on sentence, Judge Woods said it was clear that the appellant had played a significant role in manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine over several years. His Honour found that although the appellant had some role independent of a man called Leslie Kalache, his activities, as appeared from the material before the sentencing Judge, were mainly as a subordinate accomplice of Kalache. Judge Woods said that the role played by the appellant was by no means so extensive, complex and dominant as the role played by Kalache but nonetheless he played a significant role as lieutenant to Kalache. He was not merely a courier of drugs. A main part of his role with Kalache was storing and transporting the illegal drugs at Kalacheâ€™s direction. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œThe approach I take in constructing these sentences is to take each count separately to identify an appropriate sentence reflecting the criminality of that behaviour and then subsequently to consider questions of accumulation or concurrency.â€ 
         
        
        
       Count 1 
        
       
     7 On 19 September 1997 the appellant and a man called Frank Bera were arrested in a motor vehicle on their way from Kariong to Sydney. Bera had driven from Sydney at the appellantâ€™s request and direction early in the morning to the appellantâ€™s residence at 22 Vasey Close, Kariong. At about 6.50am they left together in the vehicle ferrying drugs to Sydney for Kalache. At Wahroonga the vehicle, which had been under surveillance, was stopped. A search revealed a sports bag behind a front passenger seat in which were six resealable plastic bags each containing methylamphetamine. The weight of the drugs was 1.885 kilograms. When he was arrested the appellant denied any knowledge of drugs. The appellant and Bera were subsequently charged.  
      
       
     8 The purpose of the exercise was to transfer the drugs to Kalache in Sydney for on-sale to buyers. Kalache had been the subject of extensive surveillance. This produced many taped telephone conversations, some between Kalache and other people but many involving the appellant. Judge Woods quoted parts of telephone conversations in which the appellant took part on 7 and 8 August and 18 and 20 September 1997. His Honour said he had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the trip on 19 September to Sydney involved the transportation of the methylamphetamine for and to Kalache.  
      
       
     9 The Crown submitted that the telephone conversation of 20 September, after the arrest, indicated that the appellant was not merely a tool of Kalache, rather an independent agent with another supply business and that 
      
       
        
         
         â€œbecause Kalache had had trouble with the manufacture of the drugs by the chemical cooking process, [the appellant] had filled the gap and [sic] from his independent sources, supplying Kalache with enough drugs to keep his business ticking over, so to speak, until another methylamphetamine production â€˜cookâ€™ could be established.â€ 
         
        
        
       However Judge Woods did not feel satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this inference could safety be drawn. He said that whether the appellant had a large quantity of methylamphetamine stored in his backyard for Kalache or for himself, the fact was that that he had it, and had demonstrated that he was a significant drug dealer. His Honour said that the offence required a severe deterrent penalty. 
        
        
       Count 2 
        
       
     10 Judge Woods said that Kalache and the appellant had suffered a drought of supply to Kalache from his â€œmanufacturersâ€. Kalache got several people to obtain a large quantity of Sudafed tablets and â€œChemistsâ€™ Ownâ€ brand tablets containing pseudoephedrine. About 19,000 tablets were obtained from a registered pharmacist Cheng. A clandestine drugs laboratory was set up involving a person called Lyndon Marskell to extract an illegal ingredient from the otherwise lawful Sudafed tablets and the other tablets, to extract pseudoephedrine and carry out a further reaction to manufacture methylamphetamine to be sold by Kalache and others for profit. The laboratory was set up at Washpool Creek near Booral. In fact what was created was largely seized by the police executing a search warrant at 1 Jacques Street Kingsford on 2 July 1997. At that time 3.4 kilograms of methylamphetamine were seized. Analysis proved that this drug was manufactured by Marskell and others at Booral. 
      
       
     11 His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œThe direct role which this offender played in relation to that exercise was to participate with the others in physically removing individual Sudafed or â€˜Chemistsâ€™ Ownâ€™ brand tablets from the plastic containers, an exercise which is recorded on various tapes with a â€˜poppingâ€™ noise. On 26 June 1997, [the appellant] was recorded as saying, or lamenting: â€˜All, you know, is weâ€™ve been going for three hours and it feels like weâ€™ve done nothingâ€™. 
         
        
        
         
         Anyway, they did in fact continue â€˜poppingâ€™ the tablets from their pockets and a lot was produced and seized. But the full scope of [the appellantâ€™s] involvement is not reflected entirely in the mere physical exercise that I have described. The conversations in which he is captured on tape indicate his intimate knowledge of the exercise. For example, on 21 January 1997 in a telephone conversation with the Watkins, [the appellant] says: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           â€˜8 kilos of pseudo, 8 litres of acid, 800 grams of red phosphorus, put it in a 20 litre bowl and you cook it for 24 hours (something indecipherable) 36 hours, then you cool it down, right, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m telling you.â€™ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Then he goes on further to explain his knowledge of this exercise. He says further: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           â€˜Itâ€™s a simple process, but the thing is, if you make one mistake and you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing, youâ€™ve got to go back three stages and find out the one, basically, you know what I mean? Like that stupid Roland he used cold water, he didnâ€™t use hot water, he didnâ€™t know why he stuffed it. Little things like that.â€™ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His knowledge of this criminal business was substantial. 
         
        
        
         
         It is further demonstrated in a conversation of 21 January 1997 when he says: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           â€˜40, after cutting 4 to 1 youâ€™d finish with an average cook, well, a bag cooked about 40 now should be about 44 and (something indecipherable) cost about 48.â€™ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Then he goes on to discuss the production of this product by the illegal cooking method. 
         
        
        
         
         Nonetheless, despite that knowledge, the only physical act in which he seems to be involved here is in the popping of the Sudafed tablets. Nonetheless, this is a vital part of the exercise and is essential in this particular form of illegal manufacturing. There is no doubt that it produced a quantity of drugs which was very substantial indeed, 3.4 kilograms at least.â€ 
         
        
        
       Counts 4 and 5 
        
       
     12 The sentencing Judge said that both these charges derived from the involvement of Kalache and a man called Arthur Launt, an industrial chemist from Queensland, â€œwho went wrongâ€. Launt had deviated from legitimate business into the profitable business of supplying precursor drugs for the production of unlawful methylamphetamine tablets. In December 1995 Kalache contacted Launt by telephone. The sentencing Judge had no doubt that he did so with the appellantâ€™s knowledge and acquiescence. Kalache requested Launt to supply 7.5 litres of hydriodic acid for $7,400. This product was one of the essential precursors for the cooking process of methylamphetamine. Other products were obtained from Launt paid for by Kalache. Launt had a man called Dolman, a skilled industrial chemist, who assisted in the manufacture of phenylacetic acid and other compounds. The sentencing Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œAfter the acquisition of these various chemicals, Lyndon Marskell, working essentially for Kalache, established a clandestine drug laboratory at Wollombi in New South Wales. Marskell had difficulties producing methylamphetamine using Launtâ€™s phenylacetic acid.  
         
        
        
         
         That property was found by police in April 1996 and ultimately it was seized.â€ 
         
        
       
     13 Through the agency of a person called Richard Simpson a further laboratory using materials derived from Launt was established at Dooralong. This laboratory was subsequently moved to premises at Sylvania Waters which were owned by a person called Robert Proctor. It seemed to the sentencing Judge that the appellant played some role in relation to both these exercises. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œOne of the problems was, it turns out, that Launt had produced defective material which was being used in these various exercises. The Wollombi illicit laboratory site was demonstrated to have produced methylamphetamine using pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus and hydriodic acid.  
         
        
        
         
         The Sylvania Waters laboratory revealed evidence of an attempt to make methylamphetamine using a phenylacetic acid conversion process. The likelihood of actually producing large quantities of methylamphetamine was limited by the deficiency of the chemicals supplied by Launt.â€ 
         
        
       
     14 To understand what is then recorded on the remarks on sentence it is necessary to refer to the 61 page facts sheet (the facts sheet) dated 12 December 1999 which was before the sentencing Judge. Reference was made to the police discovery of the clandestine drug laboratory site and storage area of precursor chemicals at Wollombi on 3 April 1996. In March 1996 the appellant and another person met Launt twice to establish future supplies of precursor chemicals which Launt supplied with similar faults to compounds previously supplied. On 15 April 1996 police discovered the illicit laboratory active in the bathroom of the house at Dooralong. The process used a 20 litre reaction flask, a stainless steel pot with oil and an electric hot plate and condenser, mounted in the shower recess with garden hoses. The chemical analysis of the process indicated that phenylacetic acid was converted through to P-2-P to methylamphetamine. Phenylacetic acid and benzoic acid were identified in the laboratory. Similarly a large quantity of black 20 litre drums containing labelled reducing agents, consistent with Launtâ€™s misrepresented chemicals, were seized. Premises were found at Glenfield to be used for the next manufacture process by another person. A clandestine laboratory was established there. It was not suggested the appellant played any part in this. Although this laboratory was not detected it was decided on 23 April 1996 to move the reaction chemicals and equipment to new premises at Sylvania Waters where â€œthe syndicateâ€ established a clandestine drug laboratory. William El Azzi was employed as a cook at Dooralong and Sylvania Waters. In or about June 1996 Robert McCoy was recruited to stay at the Sylvania Waters premises and operate and clean the laboratory site.  
      
       
     15 At some time in July or August 1996 Kalache told Launt that the chemicals he supplied, â€œwere not any good and they couldnâ€™t do anything with itâ€. This related to the quality of chemicals Launt was supplying to Kalache, the appellant and Haeusler. Later in 1996, as a result of slow payments by Kalache, Launt, who was supplying hydriodic acid, diluted it. This had the effect of making pseudoephedrine reduction reactions to methylamphetamine very inefficient.  
      
       
     16 The last five paragraphs of the facts sheet at page 61 were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œThe Wollombi laboratory site analysis reveal evidence of methylamphetamine being produced by the reduction of pseudoephedrine through red phosphorous and hydriodic acid and evidence of alternate attempts to manufacture methylamphetamine using a phenylacetic acid conversion. The quantity of precursors on site indicated the forensic evidence taken indicated that commercial quantities of methylamphetamine had been produced in the past. The stockpile of chemicals, solvents, reagents and apparatus would have allowed for large quantities of methylamphetamine produced in the future [sic]. 
         
        
        
         
         The Dooralong laboratory site analysis revealed evidence of methylamphetamine being produced using a phenylacetic conversion. The volume of reaction mixture located was 21.45kg (containing a mixture of benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid). 
         
        
        
         
         The Sylvania Waters laboratory revealed evidence of an attempted methylamphetamine process using a phenylacetic acid conversion. However the integrity of the starting precursor materials would have prevented this reaction to proceed successfully. The volume of reaction mixture located was approximately 17ltrs (containing a mixture of benzoic acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid). 
         
        
        
         
         A statement from Mr Murtagh of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory demonstrates the consistency in methodology and chemicals used in these laboratory sites.â€ 
         
        
       
     17 Investigations conducted during 1998 involved lawfully obtained Telephone Intercepts on services used by the accused and Haeusler, and provide direct corroboration of the activities and facts as detailed. 
      
       
     18 At the point in his remarks on sentence which I had reached, Judge Woods raised with the Crown his concern about count 5 and said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œat either Dooralong or Sylvania Waters was any quantity of the prohibited drug and specifically an amount not less than the commercial quantity? If you look at page 61 of the facts it is the third last paragraph. It suggested it was rather an attempt.â€ 
         
        
        
       Questioned by the Judge about whether that paragraph meant that the charge should be one of taking part in the attempt to manufacture, the Crown responded:  
        
        
         
         â€œNo because the charge does not only involve the failed process at Sylvania Waters, it also involves the Dooralong part of it and there was â€¦â€œ  
         
        
        
       His Honour interrupted counsel. A little later his Honour said: 
        
        
         
         â€œIs it not the case that the Dooralong laboratory site produced no actual methylamphetamine?â€  
         
        
        
       The Crown replied:  
        
        
         
         â€œI think that it was discovered in the process by the police when the manufacturing process was in train. The police arrived and effectively shut down that laboratory.â€  
         
        
        
       The sentencing Judge said: 
        
        
         
         â€œI think that would strictly be an attempt rather than â€“ I do not know. I know it is not a point taken by Mr Young [who appeared for the appellant] in those terms but I should not sentence if it is not right.â€ 
         
        
        
       The Crown said: 
        
        
         
         â€œYour Honour, to knowingly take part in the manufacture you can take a step in the process. The process does not have to result in the production of an actual product.â€ 
         
        
        
       Asked for authority the Crown referred to  
       Thomas v R 
        (1993) 67 A Crim R 308. The Crown said that in  
       Thomas  
       the quantity was not manufactured, all that was manufactured was a precursor.  
        
        
         
         â€œIt was not even at that point a prohibited drug itself. All that Thomas manufactured was P2P and I think that was the same in  
         Louden 
          and his associates too. But the case of  
         Thomas 
          is the authority for the proposition that taking a step in the process of manufacture and that is what is the basis of the charge anyway: Knowingly take part.â€ 
         
        
       
     19 After reference to s6 of the Act, the sentencing Judge said â€œ[t]he fact the process is interrupted at an intermediate stage does not take the case outside section six is the Court of Criminal Appeal decisionâ€ to which the Crown replied â€œYesâ€. The sentencing Judge said that he found that surprising. â€œObviously that is the law and obviously Mr Young has gone through the exercise in his mind anyway.â€ Mr Young said: 
      
       
        
         
         â€œI do not think they had a couple of P2P. They said it was for another reason but they ended up convicted of manufacturing methylamphetamine having only reached that stage.â€ 
         
        
        
       The sentencing Judge thanked counsel and said that he had raised the matter because it struck him as being a possible problem. Mr Young said:  
        
        
         
         â€˜It is fairly significant in terms of potential success of the operation. If you look at the Dooralong laboratory it was interrupted during the actual process and there is the amount. It does not appear over the page where your Honour has already observed. The fourth last paragraph on 61 refers to 21.45 of the reaction mixture located. That refers back to the second one on 59 when it talks about the process being interrupted. And because of what is being used they can say these chemicals having come from x, y, z but the bottom line is no product came ou",21/8/2002 0:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

     JUDGMENT 
    1Â Â Â  HIS HONOUR: Following arraignment, but before the empanelling of the jury, a number of matters have been canvassed relating to the admissibility of evidence. I will deal first with the objections to evidence on behalf of the accused Phuong Canh Ngo set out in Ex. X1 on the voir dire. The first objection is to the ballistics evidence of Messrs Roach and Pfoser on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial value. 
    2Â Â Â  The Crown alleges that the murder weapon was a 1935 .32 calibre Beretta pistol recovered from under water at Voyager Point nearly four years later on 10 June 1998 in a rusted condition. Because of such rusted condition no ballistics expert can express a firm opinion as to whether or not the firing pin matched the markings on the spent cartridge cases found at the scene of the killing. 
    3Â Â Â  The objection is taken that, in the absence of firm proof that it is the weapon, the evidence is such that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice within the terms of s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") and it is also objected to on the ground that the evidence of a technical witness, Mr Pfoser, whose methodology will be challenged in a highly technical manner, may be given greater weight than it deserves by the jury because he will be coming all the way from Germany to give his evidence. 
    4Â Â Â  The Crown case in relation to the identity of the weapon is circumstantial. There is evidence that the murder weapon was a .32 calibre pistol and one of the alleged co-offenders, TVT, who will give evidence for the Crown, says that the accused David Dinh had such a weapon in the car on the night of the killing, and there is some evidence that after the shooting it was handed by Dinh to Ngo at a service station. Sergeant Roach is expected to give evidence that the markings on the firing pin found on the rusted pistol recovered at Voyager Point is consistent with the markings on the casings found at the scene. Mr Pfoser says that it was ""more probably than not"" the same firing pin used. There is also evidence of the use of a mobile phone in the possession of the accused Ngo at the relevant time indicating that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. There is evidence of how rare this particular model of gun was generally, and in Australia in particular, and the very unusual pin impression of that model. In addition persons who had handled the gun, such as the witnesses TDN and TVT say, as I understand it, that it was similar to the gun used in earlier attempts on the life of John Newman. 
    5Â Â Â  In my opinion, based on all these matters, taken together, it would be open to the jury to conclude that the weapon used in the shooting was the weapon recovered at Voyager Point. Circumstantial cases do not depend on each individual circumstance, but on the totality of circumstances taken together and each circumstance does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt:  Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 580. Indeed, the fact that this was the murder weapon is itself merely one of the circumstances, and so does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
    6Â Â Â  The fact that one of the experts has travelled from Germany is irrelevant. The jury will have to judge his evidence on its cogency, the data on which it is based, his methodology and its relationship to the other evidence. There is no basis for suggesting that they may give added weight to his opinion because the expert witness comes from overseas. 
    7Â Â Â  Likewise the fact that the defence intends to challenge the witness' methodology on technical grounds is no reason to exclude evidence under ss 137 or 135. It will be the responsibility of counsel to put the questions including the technical ones to the expert witnesses in a form which the jury can understand, and I would expect the State's Senior Crown Prosecutor and its Senior Public Defender would be able to do this. The probative value of the evidence, if accepted, is very high and I cannot see any unfair prejudice to the accused. I will admit the evidence. 
    8Â Â Â  The second matter to which objection is taken is the evidence of PD. There are a number of problems about this evidence and I note that following lengthy argument and submissions, the Crown will not open her evidence and it has been agreed that I should defer ruling on this point. 
    9Â Â Â  The third objection is to the evidence of the reading of the evidence of a witness. In this respect the Crown Prosecutor informs me that he does not now see the need to read the evidence of CC in this trial. CC cannot presently be located and if located the Crown will lead his evidence viva voce and not seek to read it. 
    10Â Â Â  The fourth objection is to the reading of the evidence of Shirley Barrett given in the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. Ms Barrett is now deceased. Her evidence relates to calls from the mobile telephone allegedly in the possession of Ngo on the night of the murder, shortly after the murder, and relates to the alleged disposal by Ngo at Voyager Point of the alleged murder weapon. It is said by the Crown to be relevant for two purposes. She can identify the caller as the accused Ngo, as the result of which, in conjunction with evidence from Telstra regarding the operation of mobile telephone towers, his route and location at that time can be identified, and the Crown claims it can be established that he was travelling in the direction of Voyager Point. 
    11Â Â Â  Moreover, in the second of these conversations the accused Ngo says that he was then on his way home. The Crown intends to prove that he was not on his way home at the time but travelling towards Voyager Point, and seeks to rely on this evidence as a lie showing a consciousness of guilt. 
    12Â Â Â  In my view the evidence is admissible under s 65(3) of the Act and this is conceded by Mr Nicholson SC on behalf of the accused Ngo in relation to the first point, namely, the identification of the caller as the accused Ngo, but he objects to evidence of the content of the second conversation which the Crown seeks to rely on as a lie. 
    13Â Â Â  Before moving on to that point the evidence proposed to be read is the evidence in what has been referred to as the second trial of the accused Ngo and Dao. The accused Dinh was not an accused in that trial. Consequently his counsel did not have the opportunity to cross-examine, but Mr Hoenig informs me that he does not oppose admission of the evidence against his client if it is otherwise admitted. 
    14Â Â Â  Mr Nicholson's objection to the content of the second conversation said by the Crown to constitute the telling of a lie by the accused Ngo is based on the provisions of s 82(1) of the Act. He submits that evidence of a lie comes within the definition of an ""admission"" as defined in the Dictionary to the Act, being a previous representation adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of proceedings. This point must be conceded. It is established by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442, following R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. 
    15Â Â Â  But he submits that if the evidence is admitted pursuant to s 65 it is not evidence given orally by a person who heard the admission being made. He concedes that if Ms Barrett were still alive and present she could give the evidence, but because she is deceased and her evidence will be adduced by the reading of the deposition under s 65 it is not evidence given orally by her and accordingly, and in light of s 82, it is not admissible. 
    16Â Â Â  That result, absurd as it may seem, may have been the consequence of the Act in its original form when s 82 provided that s 81 did not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it was given orally by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made. But the section was amended by Act No. 53 of 2000, the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, Schedule 1 paragraph 11, which omitted the word ""orally"" from s 82(a) so that section now reads: 
     
      
       
       ""Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless it is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made."" 
       
      
      
    17Â Â Â  Ms Barrett was a person who heard the ""admission"" being made. She gives the evidence, although not orally but by deposition under s 65, and accordingly s 82(a) is not applicable, and the whole of her evidence is admissible. 
    18Â Â Â  The object of s 82 both in its original and amended form is to prevent second-hand hearsay. That is not the issue here. The evidence of Ms Barrett is her evidence and it is first hand, and it is given by her, although it was as I say given by deposition and not orally. 
    19Â Â Â  The fifth objection relates to evidence which the Crown Prosecutor informs me will not now be led, so I move on to the sixth objection, which is the leading of evidence in chief from TVT and TDN as to matters affecting their credit only. 
    20Â Â Â  TVT and TDN are accomplice witnesses who have been given indemnities and/or undertakings. It is alleged that they were engaged at various times in the common purpose with the accused Ngo and others to kill John Newman and consequently a warning concerning their evidence will be necessary under s 165. It is conceded that the evidence in chief can include evidence of the giving of the indemnities and/or undertakings.  
    21Â Â Â  I am informed that when they first spoke to the authorities they disclosed some matters of which they now seek to give evidence, but not others. The Crown wishes to lead in chief, evidence from them when they first went to the authorities, and why they did so, and also the reasons for them not disclosing all material information at that stage. The evidence is objected to on the grounds that it is forbidden by s 102 of the Act, the credibility rule. That section at the beginning of Part 3.7 is as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""Evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible.""  
       
      
      
     There follows a number of exceptions including cross-examination as to credibility (s 103) and re-establishing credibility (s 108). 
      
    22Â Â Â  It has often been considered good advocacy for counsel who has a problem witness to confront the problem head-on as early as possible, and if there are going to be questions raised about previous inconsistent statements, to lead evidence as to the reasons or excuses for such inconsistent statements during the evidence in chief, rather than wait for an attack to be made on the witness in cross-examination. However, it would appear that such evidence, strictly speaking, would not be admissible in evidence in chief at common law, and that the position would appear to be reinforced by the provisions of the Act. 
    23Â Â Â  Credibility of a witness is defined in the Dictionary as meaning, ""the credibility of any part or all of the evidence of a witness..."" Although in my experience such evidence has in the past not infrequently been led in these circumstances, the words of the section appear to be clear, and this view is confirmed by the learned authors of Cross on Evidence, Australian edition at para [19005] who state: 
     
      
       
       ""The Cth Evidence Act 1995 and NSW Evidence Act 1995 provide that evidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible: s 102. There are exceptions for cross-examination (ss 103-104), for rebuttal of certain denials by a witness (106) and for evidence re-establishing credibility (s 108), but there are no exceptions in relation to evidence in chief, save s110(1) permits an accused person who is testifying to give evidence of good character."" 
       
      
    24Â Â Â  The evidence to which objection is taken falls squarely within the definition and therefore cannot be led except pursuant to the exceptions referred to. Mr Nicholson SC referred to the need for leave under s 108(3) to lead such evidence, even in re-examination; but s 108(1) is in my view quite separate from s 108(3) and if the credit of a witness is attacked, evidence from that witness relating to his credit is admissible in re-examination under s 108(1) without leave. 
    25Â Â Â  The Crown referred me to the judgment of McHugh J in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 151 ALR 616, but that case is distinguishable for two main reasons: firstly, the case was not concerned with leading evidence relating to credibility as evidence in chief but with the cross-examination of an accused as to whether a complainant in the sexual assault case had a motive to lie or fabricate allegations, and secondly, the discussion by his Honour concerning the distinction between evidence relating to facts in issue and evidence only going to credibility was concerned mainly with the finality rule by which other evidence cannot be led to contradict evidence going only to issues of credit, and was concerned with the difficulty in defining the boundary between the two. In any event, his Honour dissented on the relevant issues in the case, and his comments are only dicta. 
    26Â Â Â  I am therefore satisfied that the two witnesses can give evidence in chief that they were charged and at a later stage went to the authorities and were later given indemnities or undertakings but their reasons or motives for going to the police and their previous inconsistent or incomplete statements cannot, or their reasons for such discrepancies cannot, be led as part of their evidence in chief but only in re-examination, provided the anticipated attack on their credit is made. 
    27Â Â Â  The learned Crown Prosecutor therefore then submits that he would seek to refer to these matters in his opening address. Mr Nicholson SC, supported by Mr Cusack SC for the accused Dao, objects and submits that they are not proper matters for an opening and will take away the ""thunder"" of the defence attack. I can see no valid objection to the course proposed by the Crown. The object of the opening is to outline the Crown case to the jury so that they will understand the Crown case as individual witnesses are called. 
    28Â Â Â  It is clearly proper for the Crown to tell the jury that they are alleged accomplices, that the jury will be warned that their evidence may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable in that context. I cannot see any reason why the Crown cannot say that their credibility will be attacked and that one of the anticipated grounds of the attack will be that initially they only told the authorities part of their current evidence, but that they will give reasons for that and for later going further and what those reasons were. 
    29Â Â Â  Evidence intended to be led by the Crown in re-examination (to rebut a telegraphed attack on the credibility of an intended witness) is just as much evidence to be led by the Crown as evidence intended to be led from the witnesses in chief. There is no principle of which I am aware, and I have not been referred to any authority, to the effect that the defence is entitled to the tactical advantage or ""thunder"" of first raising the issue of credibility of a witness. The issue of their credibility will be raised by the need for a warning concerning their evidence under s 165, and the evidence will all be before the jury at some stage. However I am also satisfied that the Crown should deal with these matters only in general terms and not proceed too far into the specifics of the differences in the various statements, but merely that there were differences, and it is anticipated that they will give explanations for such discrepancies in due course. 
    30Â Â Â  The seventh objection relates to the Crown allegedly making continual requests for the non-publication orders in the presence of the jury. The matter has been resolved and the Crown has indicated that he will make such applications in the absence of the jury. 
    31Â Â Â  The eighth objection is to the Crown making any reference in its opening or in evidence in chief to Lucy Wang which seems to seeks to impute her credit insofar as her initial observations of the motor vehicle used by the gunman to escape the scene. 
    32Â Â Â  I am informed that Lucy Wang will give evidence that the deceased's assailant got into the front seat of a dark green car. TVT says that he was a passenger in the vehicle and that the assailant, whom he identifies as the accused Dinh, got into the near side rear seat. The objection apparently is to Ms Wang saying that she thought he got into the front seat, when her evidence will be that he got into the front passenger seat. Apparently the front near side door of Dao's car did not work, and so he could not have got into the front passenger seat, if it was Dao's car, as alleged. 
    33Â Â Â  The other objection is to the Crown proffering a suggestion as to why she might have got it wrong, such as shock, et cetera. 
    34Â Â Â  I must say this all seems rather trivial and nitpicking to me but defence counsel assure me that it is of ""crucial importance"". The Crown has indicated that he will not open to the jury that she ""thought"" that the assailant got into the front seat, and will not proffer a comment as to how she may have been affected by shock, although of course he reserves the right in his closing address to make any comments properly available to him in the light of the evidence at that stage. 
    35Â Â Â  The ninth objection is to the Crown relying on any evidence from TDN or TVT of any activities or conversation which is not in furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise between them and Phuong Canh Ngo. As a general proposition this objection is clearly valid, but the objection is taken to specific pieces of the evidence which is claimed do not come within the furtherance of the alleged joint enterprise. 
    36Â Â Â  The first piece of evidence objected to is summarised at p 51 of the transcript of this hearing and relates to evidence from the witness TDN of a nocturnal visit to his premises, so it is said, by the accused Ngo, who takes TDN from his bed and drives him to the vicinity of the Mekong Club where TDN is requested to remain in the car whilst Ngo speaks to Dinh and TVT some distance away from the car, they both being employees of the Mekong Club. At the conclusion of that conversation Ngo returns to the car and returns the witness TDN to his home. 
    37Â Â Â  This is evidence of association between some of those allegedly involved in the common purpose, and it is also evidence that TDN was prepared to do Ngo's bidding, to get out of bed and to sit in a car and then go home, all as directed by Ngo and for no apparent purpose. 
    38Â Â Â  It was submitted that there may be an innocent explanation for it all and that may be so; but prima facie it is unusual conduct on the part of both Ngo and TDN. There is no evidence that Dinh was involved in the common purpose at that stage. I am satisfied that the evidence is admissible against Ngo and Dao, and Dinh is entitled to have the jury warned that there is no evidence of his involvement in any common purpose at that stage. 
    39Â Â Â  The next objection relates to evidence from TVT and TDN of a conversation, or possibly two conversations between them, when each of them says to the other words to the effect that Ngo had asked him to kill John Newman (or to kill someone). Mr Nicholson SC concedes that each of them may give evidence of the conversation in which Ngo made the request to the witness, but submits that they cannot give evidence that they told each other of the request. 
    40Â Â Â  This meeting, or these meetings, were when they discussed getting a gun, and he rightly concedes that that part of the conversation is in alleged furtherance of the common purpose but he submits that this reference to Ngo's request is not, and cannot be, in furtherance of the common purpose, but is merely narrative of what has already occurred. 
    41Â Â Â  TDN's version of the conversation is set out in the current transcript at p 61. 
    42Â Â Â  True it is neither of them expressly says that the reason he wants to get a gun is because Ngo has asked him to kill someone, but in the context of the conversation the implication is at least open, if not irresistible, that the reason that he wanted a gun was to help Ngo kill John Newman; and other evidence shows that the gun or guns, when purchased, were passed on to Ngo, and the Crown claims that one of the guns purchased by these two accomplices, or either of them (it does not matter for present purposes) was in fact the murder weapon.  
    43Â Â Â  Both the witnesses were working for Ngo, both were involved in the common purpose with him, but this is the first time, as I understand the Crown case, that they came together to join in the common purpose with each other, the reference to Ngo's request was part of the process of them sounding each other out, and the passage objected to identifies the common purpose in which they joined with each other, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman.  
    44Â Â Â  People do not seek to buy guns for no reason and this conversation in its context identifies the reason why they wanted to buy the guns. Stripped to its bare essentials the conversation amounts to this,  
     
      
       
       A says B wants me to help him kill X. A says do you know where I can get a gun?  
       
      
      
     Obviously in this context he wants a gun to help B kill X.  
      
    45Â Â Â  TVT's version is somewhat different. It is set out in the transcript at p 64, and puts that part of the conversation objected to after they had got the gun, that is the gun they have got at Ngo's instigation, but then they discussed the ultimate object of the common purpose, namely to help Ngo kill John Newman. That discussion as to the object of the common purpose would in my view be in furtherance of such common purpose and identifies the common purpose. I will admit both versions of the conversation. 
    46Â Â Â  The tenth and eleventh objections relate to portions of the ERISPs of the accused Ngo and the giving of evidence by video link. It is agreed that both of these matters may be resolved without the necessity for me giving a ruling thereon, and they can in any event be deferred for the time being. 
    47Â Â Â  In addition, Mr Hoenig, counsel for the accused David Dinh, seeks a ruling in advance that certain evidence identified in the schedule to his written submissions is not admissible against his client. That evidence may be described in general terms as evidence of declarations and acts of the others said and done prior to 5 September 1994 in furtherance of what the Crown alleges was common purpose to kill John Newman at the instigation of Phuong Ngo. Mr Hoenig submits that as his client is charged as a principal in the first degree, as the actual shooter, rules relating to criminal complicity such as common purpose and the associated evidentiary rules under which the acts and declarations of each of the participants in furtherance of the common purpose are admissible against each of them are not relevant. 
    48Â Â Â  These issues have already been canvassed before me in an application to set aside an order for a separate trial. R v Ngo, Dao, Dinh [2000] NSWSC 964, and in the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal from that decision [2000] NSWCCA 536. The Court noted they were only interlocutory judgments, as is the present one. 
    49Â Â Â  As I said at para [40] in my earlier judgment,  
     
      
       
       ""It follows that the acts and declarations of the other alleged participants in the common purpose are admissible to prove the nature of the enterprise, not the accused Dinh's participation in it"",  
       
      
      
     and I referred to a number of cases. 
      
    50Â Â Â  This statement of principle was upheld by the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [52], and it was also said at para [49]: 
     
      
       
       ""The fact that a person enters into a joint criminal enterprise at a time after the enterprise has already commenced does not mean that the joint enterprise changes its nature or that a new joint enterprise commences merely by reason of the involvement of the new person in that enterprise. Nor is evidence of what occurred during the course of the enterprise before the person entered into it necessarily inadmissible against the person lately joining the enterprise."" 
       
      
      
       
      
     and their Honours referred to 
       
     R v Bilick and Stark 
      (1984) 11 A Crim R 452 at 462. The Court of Criminal Appeal also pointed out at para [54] that the admissibility of the evidence does not depend on the part played by the particular accused in the joint enterprise, for example, as principal in the first or second degree or accessory etc.  
      
    51Â Â Â  Although the Crown case against the accused Dinh depends on the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he actually fired the fatal shots, the fact that the Crown has no evidence that he joined the enterprise prior to 4 September 1994 does not render the previous acts and declarations of the other participants in the common purpose inadmissible against him; although as both the Court of Criminal Appeal and myself have emphasised it is only admissible to show the nature of the common purpose and not admissible to show the participation in it of the accused Dinh. This latter element must be proved by other evidence. 
    52Â Â Â  The evidence is admissible on this basis but the accused Dinh is entitled to a clear direction to the jury of this limitation on the use of such evidence. 
    53Â Â Â  Moreover, a lot of evidence proposed to be led of events prior to 5 September 1994 is also admissible against Dinh on another basis, namely to show the surrounding circumstances in which it is alleged he was recruited by Ngo to carry out the killing. 
    54Â Â Â  Evidence of surrounding circumstances is generally relevant to show why parties may have acted as they did, to put the facts in their context and to enable a proper understanding of the evidence e.g. Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334; Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 630; R v Dinh in the Court of Criminal Appeal at para [56]. 
    55Â Â Â  Such evidence is often relevant in cases of sexual assaults, as evidence of events taken in isolation may seem incredible, but understood in the context of the surrounding circumstances and other events, they take on a very different quality: R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708. 
    56Â Â Â  Just as shootings do not occur in a vacuum, recruitment of shooters does not occur in a vacuum. As the Crown case is that Dinh acted at the request of Ngo it is correctly conceded that evidence that Ngo had a motive to have John Newman killed is relevant and admissible. 
    57Â Â Â  In my opinion evidence tending to show that Ngo had expressed a desire to have him killed, that he had requested TDN to shoot him and that he had asked TVT to find him a shooter, that he had arranged the purchase of guns for the purpose and had possession of at least one of the guns, that he had instigated three previous unsuccessful attempts on Newman's life, that he was seen driving in the streets near Newman's house two nights before the killing, and that persons previously recruited to carry out the killing had either withdrawn or proved incompetent is all relevant to show the circumstances in which Dinh was allegedly recruited.  
    58Â Â Â  Ngo had (according to the Crown) the motive, the guns, the address, the car, and everything except the shooter. Those facts rendered it more likely that he would, on 5 September 1994 try to obtain a shooter, and therefore more likely that a shooter would be recruited. Without those facts the jury might wonder why he would recruit a shooter at the last minute and therefore consider it less likely that Dinh or anyone else would be recruited. The evidence is such that if accepted it could rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, namely the recruitment of Dinh into the enterprise. It is therefore relevant (s 55) and admissible (s 56). 
    59Â Â Â  For these reasons I am satisfied that most, if not all of such evidence is admissible to show the circumstances that existed at the time the Crown alleges Dinh was recruited by Ngo to shoot Newman. It is also admissible to show the nature of the enterprise which Dinh allegedly joined, but not to show that he did join it or participate in it. There may be some pieces of the evidence in the schedule which go to neither of these issues, and I would be prepared to consider them separately when the time came. 
    60Â Â Â  Subject to that I will admit the evidence indicated against the accused Dinh. 
    61Â Â Â  HIS HONOUR: The other point was the character evidence and Mr Cusack I understand you to be happy to defer that for the time being? 
     
     CUSACK: Yes your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: On 8 August 2005, following a trial by judge alone in the District Court both appellants were convicted on an indictment that charged them jointly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œThat â€¦ that [they] on 5 July 2002 at Taree in the State of New South Wales did have in their possession a precursor intended by them for use in the manufacture by them or another person of a prohibited drug.â€ 
        
       
      
    2 The appellants were duly sentenced. Each now appeals against her conviction. Neither seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 The charge was brought under s24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ24A Possession of precursors for manufacture or production of prohibited drugs 
         
         
        (1) A person who has possession of a precursor intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.â€ 
        
       
       
      A â€œprecursorâ€ is defined as a substance specified or described in regulations made pursuant to the Act as a precursor for the purposes of this section. It was not in issue that the substance the Crown alleged was in the possession of the appellants came within that definition. 
       
      
    4 The facts alleged by the Crown were in relatively narrow compass. The Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    5 The appellants are mother (Franklin) and daughter (Jackwitz). Both were resident in Queensland. On 26 June 2002, driving a utility the rear of which was covered with a hard fibreglass canopy, they travelled from Queensland to New South Wales, stopping at various pharmacies. At each of at least 14 pharmacies they purchased, in small quantities, medications, the common element of which was that they contained pseudoephedrine. 
     
      
    6 In a notebook (exhibit G) and diary (exhibit B) either or both of the appellants kept records of their purchases, together with a note of the profit they anticipated making on disposing of the medications. On 5 July 2002 Jackwitz drove the vehicle to a Taree pharmacy. Franklin purchased a packet of sinus and nasal medication. The pharmacist alerted police to the activities of the appellants. Police stopped the vehicle and searched it. In the rear of the utility they found a garbage bag which contained a large number of bubble-packed sheets of packets of medications of three different kinds. In the front of the vehicle they found more of the medications in the glove box. Also in the vehicle was located the notebook and diary mentioned above. 
     
      
    7 In all, the tablets in the possession of the appellants contained 347.1 grams of pseudoephedrine-hydrochloride. 
     
      
    8 Also found in the vehicle were receipts for the medications in the name of Jackwitz. Others were located in the handbags of the two appellants. 
     
      
       
      the trial 
       
      
    9 By notice of motion dated 6 December 2004 each applicant sought an order that the indictment be quashed upon the ground that it was bad for duplicity. Having heard argument on the question, Payne DCJ dismissed the notice of motion, holding that the indictment did not suffer from the defect of duplicity. 
     
      
    10 Evidence was given in the trial by two Taree pharmacists, each of whom asserted that Franklin had entered the pharmacy and purchased medications containing pseudoephedrine. Both, obviously suspicious, reported the purchases to police. It was as a consequence of these notifications that the appellantsâ€™ vehicle was stopped and searched. 
     
      
    11 Evidence was also given by various police officers involved, and expert evidence was given by Detective Inspector Willingham; and a statement of a police forensic scientist, Mr William Allender, was tendered. 
     
      
    12 There are two essential elements to the charge under s24A: 
     
      
       
      (i) possession of a precursor; 
       
      (ii) intention that the precursor be used, either by the accused person, or by another person, in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    13 In relation to Jackwitz, in the circumstances there could have been, and was, no issue as to the first element, of possession, which was conclusively established by the direct evidence. That was not so in relation to Franklin, whose position was that the substance was in the exclusive possession of Jackwitz. The Crown sought to prove the intention of the appellants by circumstantial evidence. The circumstances included the repeated purchases, at different pharmacies in a wide variety of locations, of the medications; the recording in the notebook and diary of the purchases; the recording of the anticipated profit; and the quantity of the substance found in their possession. 
     
      
    14 Neither appellant gave evidence. Jackwitz argued, in effect, that the Crown had failed to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that her possession (which was not disputed) of the substance was for the relevant purpose. Franklin argued that the Crown had failed to prove that she had possession of the substance. 
     
      
    15 The trial judge, Payne DCJ, declared herself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two appellants were part of a joint (criminal) enterprise and were in joint possession of all of the medication found in the vehicle. She held that the only inference available on the evidence was that each appellant intended the precursor to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, either by herself, or by another person. 
     
      
    16 Accordingly, she convicted each of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 Initially, each appellant pleaded six grounds of appeal. These were in identical terms, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ1. The conviction of the appellant be quashed upon the ground that the charge upon which she was convicted was bad for duplicity. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence at the conclusion of the prosecution case disclosed a  
        prima facie 
         case or a case requiring the appellant to be called upon to answer. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in law in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution case. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence was capable of satisfying her, as tribunal of fact, of the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        5. That the trial judge erred in law in holding that the evidence established the intent of the appellant as charged, viz; possession with intent for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 
        
       
       
        
        6. That the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion and the application of s138  
        Evidence Act [1995] 
         by admitting over objection the evidence of the stopping, detention and search of the motor vehicle.â€ 
        
       
      
    18 On the appeal, each appellant abandoned reliance upon ground 6. Franklin sought and was granted leave to amend the notice of appeal by adding a further ground, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ7. Error of law in finding that the appellant was in joint possession of a prohibited drug.â€ 
        
       
       
      ground 1 
       
      
    19 Both at first instance and on appeal the argument put in relation to duplicity focused upon that part of the indictment which asserted possession of the precursor, intended by the appellants: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œâ€¦ for use in the manufacture  
        by them or another person 
        â€  
         
        (italics added) 
        
       
       
      of a prohibited drug. 
       
      
    20 The argument advanced was that, in framing s24A as it did, the legislature intended to create at least four different offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) possession of the precursor for the purpose of the manufacture of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (b) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by the person in possession; 
       
      (c) possession of a precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession; 
       
      (d) possession of a precursor for the purpose of production of a prohibited drug by a person other than the person in possession. 
       
      
    21 Duplicity in an indictment occurs where the charge, as stated, properly construed, charges the accused with having committed two or more separate offences: see Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 44th Edition (1995), Vol 1, p75, cited in Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; 188 CLR 77 at 84. The essence of the appellantsâ€™ argument is that, by incorporating in a single charge an allegation that the appellants had possession of the precursor for manufacture of a prohibited drug either by themselves, or by another person, two separate offences were incorporated â€“ that is, the offence of possession for the purpose of manufacture by themselves; and possession of the precursor for the purpose of manufacture of a prohibited drug by some other person. 
     
      
    22 In support of the argument counsel relied upon what was described as an â€œenlighteningâ€ decision of the English Court of Appeal in Mallon v Allen [1964] 1 QB 385, it being submitted (in written submissions) that the effect of that case was that: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œâ€¦ where an indictment alleging a person had been â€˜permitted or allowedâ€™ to remain on premises was held to be bad, on the basis that two offences were alleged.â€ 
        
       
      
    23 The submission significantly misstates what was held in that case. The statute there under consideration provided: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œNo person who is apparently under the age of 18 years â€¦ shall be admitted to or allowed to remain on those premises â€¦â€ 
        
       
      
    24 It can readily be seen that that statutory provision clearly created offences of two different characters, constituted by two different acts: admitting a person under the age of 18 years to licensed premises; and allowing a person under the age of 18 years to remain upon licensed premises. The conduct in each case is quite different. In the one case it is admitting a person of the prohibited age into licensed premises; in the other it is allowing a person of relevant age already in the licensed premises to remain there. It is the conduct which is the gist of the offence. 
     
      
    25 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the High Court in Walsh v Tattersall. In that case, a single charge was brought under a statute which made an offence of obtaining by dishonest means any payment or other benefit under the statute. The defendant, Walsh, was charged with obtaining a series of payments or benefits by dishonest means. The payments or benefits were particularised. 
     
      
    26 It was there argued that the count was bad for duplicity as alleging a number of separate offences. Dawson and Toohey JJ rejected the argument. Their Honours noted that the prosecution case was not of a series of separate dishonest pretences, but that, as a result of, effectively, a single dishonest pretence, Walsh received multiple payments or benefits. The gist of the offence was the act of dishonesty in making a false pretence. 
     
      
    27 Gaudron and Gummow JJ decided the case on what they described as â€œan anterior questionâ€, and did not deal with the duplicity issue. Kirby J was of the opinion that the count was bad for duplicity. 
     
      
    28 The decision is of only the most marginal relevance. There is nothing in Walsh v Tattersall that throws any light on the present issue. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants must fail. The essential element of the offence charged is possession of the precursor, accompanied by the relevant intention. It is not essential to the proof of that charge that the person in possession have a specific intent as to the identity of the individual or individuals who will manufacture or produce the prohibited drug; that is merely incidental. It may well be that an offender has possession of a precursor with intent that it be made into a prohibited drug without a final intention as to by whom the prohibited drug is to be made. 
     
      
    30 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 
       
      
    31 Grounds 2 and 3 are essentially the same ground â€“ that the trial judge was in error in holding that the Crown had established a prima facie case. Ground 4 and 5 are an extension of those grounds, that the evidence was insufficient to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    32 The argument put on behalf of Jackwitz was that the Crown had failed to exclude the possibility that the appellants had purchased the medication for resale for profit, purely as medication. Senior counsel sought to draw comfort from the evidence of the notebook, concerning the anticipated profits. 
     
      
    33 The trial judge drew an inference, from evidence to which I have already referred, that the intention of both appellants was the manufacture of a prohibited drug. In my opinion that inference was amply available to her. Indeed, the alternative inference, proposed on behalf of Jackwitz, is entirely without any foundation in the evidence, and well beyond the bounds of rationality. I am satisfied that her Honour made no error in finding that the Crown had established a prima facie case, in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the prosecution, nor in proceeding to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the intention of the appellants. 
     
      
       
      ground 7: joint possession 
       
      
    34 This ground was advanced only on behalf of Franklin. Reliance was placed on her behalf on R v Amanatidis [2001] NSWCCA 400; R v GNN [2000] SASC 447; and R v Filippetti (1984) 13 A Crim R 335. It may be accepted that, emerging from these authorities, knowledge of the presence of a prohibited substance is not sufficient to establish possession; the Crown must establish that the prohibited substance is not in the exclusive possession of another person; and must establish physical control and an intention to exercise control over it. These are unremarkable propositions. 
     
      
    35 They do not address the issue raised on the evidence. I do not propose to restate that evidence in great detail. Both appellants were present in the vehicle over a number of days. The evidence was that Franklin, on at least two occasions, entered the pharmacies and purchased the substances. It was open to the trial judge to draw an inference, as she did, that the two appellants were party to a joint criminal enterprise. From there it is an obvious inference that they were in joint possession of the substance. 
     
      
    36 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I propose that, in each case, the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    38 BARR J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    39 HOEBEN J: I agree with Simpson J.

       STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v JANE MOSS 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1Â Â Â  MASON P: In 1988 the respondent was a Year 10 student at a State high school. She suffered severe burns during a science experiment. Proceedings were commenced against the appellant in the Supreme Court and were then transferred to the District Court. The appellant admitted negligence. 
     
      
    2Â Â Â  The assessment of damages was undertaken in 1998 by jury in a trial presided over by Judge Sinclair QC. The jury awarded a verdict of $799,580. In the light of the way the case had gone to the jury, the parties were able to agree that the verdict should be treated as containing the following integers: 
     
      
      General damages $225,000 
       
      Past wage loss $ 20,000 
       
      Future wage loss $330,356 
       
      Past medical and hospital expenses $ 64,500 
       
      Future medical and hospital expenses $ 79,724 
       
      Past voluntary assistance $ 80,000 
       
       Total $799,580 
       
       
      
    3Â Â Â  It was necessary to work out what interest was payable on the verdict and to allow the appellant credit for payments already made. As to interest, it was held that the respondent was entitled to interest on $112,500 (half of general damages) for 10.15 years at the rate of 2%. This came to $22,837. It was further ordered that the respondent was entitled to interest totalling $89,100 with respect to the award for past voluntary assistance and to interest totalling $20,000 with respect to the award for past economic loss. When these sums were added to the jury's verdict and when the appellant was allowed credit in respect of payments already made by it, the resultant figure was $873,529. Judgment was entered in this sum. 
     
      
    4Â Â Â  At the time of the accident the respondent was an attractive young woman, aged 14. In response to a question whether she was a good student she replied ""not bad. I wouldn't say badâ€. Her long-term ambition was to become a hairdresser. There was ample material before the jury capable of satisfying them that she would have achieved this goal had the cosmetic and physical injuries suffered in the accident not prevented it. She already had a part-time job. She had studied typing. Despite her horrific injuries, suffered in June 1988, her school certificate results at the end of that year were commendable. She had never returned to school after the accident, but had studied at home with the assistance of a tutor. Her post injury employment record and her capacity to get on with life after the accident demonstrated considerable drive and capacity. She was a competitive sportswoman, playing netball regularly and (for the two years prior to the trial in 1998) being involved in the administration of a netball competition. She was fortunate to have the support of caring parents and, latterly, of her husband. It would appear that she continued in paid employment right up to the birth of her two children in October 1995 and May 1998 and that she returned to paid employment fairly soon after each child's birth. 
     
      
    5Â Â Â  The accident in the science laboratory involved an experiment to extract fat from a sausage. The sausage was put into a beaker and heated over a tripod. Methylated spirits was poured into the beaker and there was an explosion. There was extensive burning to the whole of the respondent's face and most of her neck. The front and back of her hands were terribly burnt. There was also burning over much of the front of her body, including her right breast and over parts of her legs. 
     
      
    6Â Â Â  The respondent was in intensive care at Westmead hospital for two and half weeks and she spent a further three and half weeks in the burns unit at that hospital. She then returned to her parentsâ€™ home. As indicated above, she never went back to school. There were many return visits to hospital for skin grafts, operations on her hands, operations on her ears (which on the outside had been reduced to small cauliflowers). There was extensive physiotherapy. For two and half years the respondent wore a pressure suit, known as a Jobst suit. This was painful and unsightly and the respondent needed help to get it on and off each day. The scarring was not just physical: the respondent required psychotherapy to cope with the anger, distress and sense of loss experienced in her teenage years. 
     
      
    7Â Â Â  Considerable scarring remains. According to a 1997 report from her plastic surgeon Mr Thompson, there remains very extensive visible burn scarring involving all areas of the respondentâ€™s face and the front of her neck and particular disfigurement of both external ears. The facial disfigurement is gross, visible and impossible to disguise adequately. No further surgical treatment is likely to ameliorate the overall impact of the facial scarring, which will be permanent and lifelong. There is also gross disfigurement of both hands which is impossible to disguise. The breast scarring caused difficulties in feeding the respondent's first daughter. The deformed ears remain very ugly. The respondent's hands are tight and cramped at times. The sensitivity of her skin means that she is restricted in exposing it to sunlight and needs special cosmetics. 
     
      
    8Â Â Â  In their final addresses to the jury, counsel for each party spoke to Schedules of Damages which they had prepared and which were given to the jury. The respondent's Schedule was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. 
          
        GENERAL DAMAGES 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The plaintiff has suffered horrific injuries. She has gross scarring of the face, neck, breast and hands. She has large graft patches on her thighs and burn marks on her legs. She has distorted buds where her ears were. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) She has undergone about 12 operations, mainly involving skin grafts with skin cut from her thighs. Her last admission to hospital was only 14 months ago. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) In the course of her treatment she has been subjected to exquisitely painful procedures such as the daily baths to scrape off skin in her first admission and the scouring of her ears by her mother at home. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) She wore an ugly, constricting and uncomfortable pressure suit for two years. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) She has suffered and will suffer for the rest of her life (57 years) the mental anguish associated with her disfigurement and the loss of her self worth. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) She has suffered acute depression and post traumatic stress disorder for years and continues to suffer those conditions to a lesser degree. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) She is vulnerable to life stresses with which other people could cope, with the result that for her these stresses would probably result in depressive illness, with the further disruption of her life and the further need for psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) She is restricted in where she can go (she must avoid sunlight) and what she can do (her hands, particularly, cannot stand exertion or trauma). 
        
       
       
        
        (i) She is constantly reminded by the thoughtlessness of others of the serious compromise of her former beauty. This will never change. 
        
       
       
        
        (j) She has the constant chore of having to protect her skin with creams and to apply special make-up which partially masks some of her scars. 
        
       
       
        
        (k) She suffers from constant obsessive thoughts of what might have been if she had not been burned. 
        
       
       
        
        2. PAST WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        It is difficult to be precise about the plaintiffâ€™s loss to date. She lost the best part of a year in 1989 and is entitled to be paid for the holiday pay which she took when she had to have operations. 
        
       
       
        
        As well, there have been broken periods when the plaintiff has not worked, or not worked as much as she otherwise would have. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to her relatively low earnings to date, it is submitted an appropriate allowance over the 10 years to date would be $20,000 
        
       
       
        
        3. FUTURE WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The present average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales is $500 per week. The plaintiff averages less than $300 per week, a difference of $200 per week. Over 40 years, to age 65, that throws up a loss of $244,840. Discounted by 10%, that is $220,356 
        
       
       
        
        (b) In addition, an amount ought to be allowed for the loss by the plaintiff of the opportunity to run her own business and to earn substantially above the average. No precise figures appear in the evidence, but it is submitted an appropriate sum would be $110,000 which represents a further $100 per week over 40 years discounted by 10%. Allow - $110,000 
        
       
       
        
        4. PAST MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        Agreed figure - $64,500 
        
       
       
        
        5. FUTURE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Cosmetics, sun screen, moisturiser $12 per week for 57 years (multiplier $143.90). Allow - $17,255 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Hospital and medical excluding psychological costs (see Dr Thompson, report 25 September 1997, estimate of $14,000). Allow - $10,000 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Psychological treatment - 
        
       
       
        
        â€¢ Dr Edwards - psychological consultation weekly for two years at $142 (multiplier $1-1.30): $14,389 
         
        â€¢ Then three-weekly for further eight years $16,595 
        
       
       
        
        (d) It is submitted that on the evidence of Drs Milton and Dyball as to the plaintiffâ€™s vulnerability to life events, an amount should be allowed as a buffer for the years from year 11 to year 57. Allow - $25,000 
        
       
       
        
        6. PAST VOLUNTARY ASSISTANCE 
        
       
       
        
        (See separate schedule) 
         
        
       
      
    9Â Â Â  It can be seen that this document served at least four purposes: it showed the breakup of damages claimed by the respondent; secondly, it showed what items were agreed and what items were at issue; thirdly, it stated the maximum sums claimed for items of special damages; fourthly, it summarised the basis upon which the respondent advanced her claim under some of the heads of damage. 
     
      
    10Â Â Â  The two schedules went to the jury without objection on either side. They were referred to by counsel in addresses. It is not suggested that any assertion in the respondent's schedule was contrary to the evidence.  
     
      
    11Â Â Â  Judge Sinclair summed up to the jury on 13 August 1998. At the end of the summing up counsel for the appellant (the defendant in the court below) raised minor items of redirection that are not presently relevant. While developing his submission on one point, he contended that the trial judge had usurped the function of the jury and prejudiced the defendant's case. Asked whether he was asking for a discharge of the jury, counsel said that he did not have those instructions. Counsel then reverted to a rather confusing submission about future economic loss. It is hardly surprising that his Honour directed counsel to put in writing the redirection which he sought and to make it available to his opponent and to the judge by 9.15am the following morning. 
     
      
    12Â Â Â  No redirection was sought the following morning. Instead, counsel for the defendant applied for a discharge of the jury. The application was refused. The judge again invited counsel for the defendant to seek further directions, preferably in writing, if he had matters of complaint. No further direction was sought. 
     
      
    13Â Â Â  The appellant's failure to seek a redirection is not necessarily fatal, although it is a most material matter in determining whether there was a substantial wrong or miscarriage (Pt 51 r23, General Motors-Holdenâ€™s Pty Ltd v Moularas (1964) 111 CLR 234, Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 at 39). 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 to 3 (unbalanced summing up) 
       
      
    14Â Â Â  Taken together, these grounds assert that the trial judge was partisan and unduly favourable to the respondent in his summing up. Eleven passages are identified in the written submissions. It is unnecessary to set them out in this judgment, all the more so because the appellant accepts that they must be read in the context of the summing up as a whole. 
     
      
    15Â Â Â  The summing up contains the conventional information about the respective roles of judge and jury. The jury were cautioned against inferring that the judge held any view as to the facts and told that they were not bound by such view in any event. Of course, such remarks will not insulate an otherwise unbalanced summing up from appellate review.  
     
      
    16Â Â Â  I shall deal separately with the portions of the summing up relating to the income that would have been earned had the respondent been able to pursue the goal of owning her own hairdressing business. The remaining passages did not cause the trial to miscarry. Some of the impugned comments merely restate the arguments of the respondent at trial. None are unsupported by the evidence (with the possible exception of those concerning the hairdressing business). The references to ""the horrific happening"" and the ""ghastly outfit called a Jobst suit"" were statements of the obvious. 
     
      
    17Â Â Â  The challenge to the remark about the likelihood that the respondent would have made ""a good result of her life"" had she not been injured was clearly supportable on the evidence. Like the statement â€œeverybody says this is a lady who has got bags of gutsâ€, it was as relevant to the appellant's case as it was to the respondent's case. 
     
      
    18Â Â Â  A judge does not descend into the arena merely because he or she expresses a view about the facts favourable to one party. 
     
      
    19Â Â Â  In the light of the way the trial proceeded to verdict the appellantâ€™s challenge based on partisanship clearly fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 (value of lost opportunity to be a hairdresser) 
       
      
    20Â Â Â  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving to the jury the respondent's claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct her own hairdressing business, there being no evidence of the earnings of self-employed hairdressers. 
     
      
    21Â Â Â  As stated above, the appellant faces the hurdle of establishing a substantial wrong or miscarriage in the context of a summing up about which no relevant redirection was sought. 
     
      
    22Â Â Â  The amended Statement of Particulars filed on behalf of the respondent well prior to the trial foreshadowed a claim that the injuries caused her to lose the opportunity of working as a hairdresser as well as the opportunity of owning and working in her own hairdressing salon. Her ambition to have done so is not in issue. And the appellant does not dispute that the cosmetic injuries and the injuries to the respondent's hands combined to prevent her from pursuing such employment.  
     
      
    23Â Â Â  The Schedule of Damages upon which counsel for the respondent addressed shows that the claim for â€œfuture wage lossâ€ over 40 years set off the respondent's pattern of actual earnings to reach a two-part figure: 
     
      
       
        
        - average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales $500 per week = $220, 356 
         
        - additional allowance for the respondent's loss of the opportunity to run her own hairdressing business, claimed at the rate of an additional $100 per week = $110, 000. 
        
       
      
    24Â Â Â  The jury awarded these sums in full. The appellant complains about the additional $110,000. 
     
      
    25Â Â Â  It should be said at the outset that the jury were entitled to conclude that the respondent's prospects were ""above-average"". They saw her give evidence. They were entitled to view her prospects favourably, given the drive and resourcefulness which she had demonstrated before and after the accident, together with the evidence as to parental support which she was fortunate to have. The evidence is summarised above. The jury were clearly entitled to conclude that the respondent would probably have achieved her goal of becoming a hairdresser and eventually owning her own hairdressing salon, although it ought to have been understood that this would not have occurred overnight. 
     
      
    26Â Â Â  The appellantâ€™s submission as refined in argument accepts these matters. At the end of the day the nub of the complaint is the absence of evidence to support the proposition that a hairdressing business could or would have projected the respondent's earnings beyond those of the average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales ($500 per week). Cf Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks (1957) 97 CLR 367. The real issue is whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the loss of that opportunity was productive of financial loss (Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347). 
     
      
    27Â Â Â  I had originally been troubled by this ground of appeal. However, the judgment of Heydon JA with which I respectfully agree has allayed my concerns. I agree with what his Honour has written and would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 (vicissitudes) 
       
      
    28Â Â Â  The appellant complains about the directions in relation to the conventional deduction for vicissitudes. It will be seen that this was an area where a specific objection was taken about the summing up. 
     
      
    29Â Â Â  In the respondent's Schedule of Damages (par 8 above) the respondent proposed a discount of 10 percent in the calculation of future economic loss. As will be seen below, the jury were invited to choose a factor between 10% and 15% and they chose 10%. The jury awarded the respondent everything that she claimed in regard to economic loss. 
     
      
    30Â Â Â  The relevant direction, the complaint made about it at trial, and the trial judge's response to that complaint were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Then you have got this question of diminution of earning capacity, and in relation to that you have got paragraph 3, â€œfuture wage lossâ€, and you see the basis of the submissions put to you by counsel for the plaintiff and what figures he takes.  
        I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you. 
          
        
       
       
        
        Because the law says that, for instance, when you are calculating a future wage loss, take a simple example of $10 a week for the next twenty years of a fellowâ€™s life. He might have chopped a bit of his finger off, but not much otherwise. You do not say that is $10 a year for this and this, and $10 a week for this, so that is $500 a year and ten years is $5,000 and so forth, because you would arrive at a sum which is far too much. What you have to take into account in your verdict is the present lump sum value of so much a week. There may be cases when you cannot do it on that basis, but whatever approach you take, frankly, you have to take some approach to start with to get an idea of what it is really worth, and the law says you go to the tables produced by actuaries and that is why you were given that figure, the multiplier, by counsel for the plaintiff. And so you have got the multiplier there. A dollar a week for the next 40 years is $1,224. If you were going to give her $100 a week then you put two noughts on the end of that. 
        
       
       
        
        And then you might say â€œwhat is this discount by 10 per centâ€. That is another thing. The law says that when assessing the value of the diminution of earning capacity in the future, you must take into account the â€œvicissitudesâ€ is a word I have always used, but it now seems to be exigencies of life. In other words, if you had a simple fellow who had a simple job and a set wage and then he lost his leg or something, and you are looking at assessing his loss of wages in the future  
        you have got to take into account the facts of life.  
        
       
       
        
        How many people go through life working five days a week for 40 years without  
        having a bit of time off for something 
        .  
        Either they get an illness, or prang the car, or have an argument with the boss and they have to find a job somewhere else. That is some pretty rough examples of what vicissitudes of life is, and the court says then you come to your figure of diminution of earning capacity, you must then make a reasonable discount, again bearing in mind a particular plaintiff as to vicissitudes of life 
        . After all, if the plaintiff in another case with a broken leg had not been in another job for a couple of months, and had an unfortunate habit of spending too long in the pub of a Friday night, and might even have got knocked down on the way home, that is the vicissitudes of life and that is why the discount is there. It has been suggested at 10 per cent by counsel for the plaintiff and I do not think any other figure has been suggested by counsel for the defendant, am I right? 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: I havenâ€™t your Honour, but your Honour would know that 10 per cent is not the normal vicissitude of life. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Iâ€™m not concerned with normal I am concerned with the plaintiff, and I asked you to give me submissions. 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: Well 15 per cent, if the jury gets that far, I would submit that it is 15 per cent. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:  
        Members of the jury, your range is 10 to 15 per cent 
        .  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    31Â Â Â  It was clear that the respondent was not going to earn $600 per week for an unbroken period of 40 years. For workers generally and for this plaintiff in particular there would be many contingencies or vicissitudes, positive and negative, properly to be taken into account. In this State 15% is a conventional starting point, as counsel reminded his Honour. 
     
      
    32Â Â Â  The appellant relies upon the following passage in the judgment of Beazley JA (with whom Powell JA and I agreed) in Nestle Australia v McDougall, Court of Appeal, unreported, 24 June 1998:  
     
      
       
        
        It is accepted that the â€œusual deductionâ€ for contingencies is 15%. This percentage was accepted by the High Court as â€œthe practiceâ€ in New South Wales, â€œsubject to adjustment up or down to take account of the plaintiffâ€™s particular circumstancesâ€: see  
        Wynn 
         at 498. See also  
        Moran v McMahon 
         (1985) 3 NSWLR 700 at 713-714;

         [1982] 2 NSWLR 26 at 30;  
        Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Pelosi 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 2 February 1996). See also  
        Government Insurance Office of NSW v Wojnar 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 15 December 1988) at 13 where Kirby P stated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          â€œA conventional discount of 15% â€¦ is allowed in many cases, although this Court has been at pains to say that there is no warrant for inflexibility in fixing the appropriate deduction. The eventualities which people, individually, are likely to face in their lives necessarily vary enormously. They are particular to each injured claimant.â€ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A survey of the authorities reveals that discounts of up to 40% have been applied for vicissitudes.  
        Urban Transit Authority of New South Wales v Seitis 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 17 May 1995) was one such case, where this Court increased the discount for vicissitudes from 25% to 40% where the plaintiff had cerebral palsy. It should be noted, however, that a 40% discount has been described as â€œhighâ€:  
        New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation v Sprengnagel 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 28 March 1995) per Priestley JA at 8. 
        
       
       
      
    33Â Â Â  The principal negative contingencies or â€œvicissitudesâ€ that are normally taken into account are sickness, accident, unemployment and industrial disputes (Wynn v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 485 at 497). The latter two considerations were unlikely to impact markedly upon the trade of female hairdressing, assuming (as was the case presented) that the respondent was effectively locked into this perspective. This left sickness or accident and they were covered by the trial judgeâ€™s directions.  
     
      
    34Â Â Â  Should the trial judge have told the jury that 15% was conventional in New South Wales? Failure to have done so was not, in my view, itself an error leading to a substantial miscarriage given the facts of this case and the appellantâ€™s failure, through counsel, to press the trial judge for a more specific direction concerning vicissitudes in which reasons for not departing from the conventional figure were outlined. 
     
      
    35Â Â Â  The nub of the appellantâ€™s complaint on this head is that the direction given by his Honour did not suggest any reasons why a lower than usual discount might be appropriate for this respondent. She was married with two young children, so the likelihood was that greater rather than less interruptions might be on the cards even for a modern working wife. Judicial statements about the relevance of individual circumstances are usually made in order to indicate that a greater than usual discount is called for, except for particular plaintiffs in occupations that enjoy high levels of security (see Luntz op cit pp285-6). To have left the jury with choosing between a 10-15% range was inadequate, notwithstanding the perfunctory submissions of the appellantâ€™s counsel at trial. The respondentâ€™s drive and capacity to work and to earn higher than average had been addressed (however adequately) in the juryâ€™s consideration of a starting point for the respondents pre-injury earning capacity ie the figures of $500 or $600 per week as the case was advanced by the respondent. This was the universe of discourse in which progression through apprenticeship to full employment to proprietorship was addressed. Additional remuneration through promotion was hardly apposite to self-employment in a hairdressing business. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 (general damages excessive) 
       
      
    36Â Â Â  As indicated above, the parties agreed that $225,000 was awarded for general damages. The appellant submits that this was excessive when one takes into account the fact that the respondent was able to achieve a stable domestic situation, marrying and bearing two children, and obtaining steady employment. She had played netball regularly for six years at date of trial and had also, at times, played touch football and indoor cricket. 
     
      
    37Â Â Â  The appellant sought to compare the jury's award with the sums payable for a most extreme case under the Motor Accidents Act and the maximum allowable for a work injury under the Workers Compensation Act. This is not a proper basis for challenging an uncapped jury verdict. 
     
      
    38Â Â Â  I have briefly summarised the extent and the impact of the respondent's injuries and the disabilities stemming from them. There was extensive pain and suffering over a prolonged period, exacerbated by frequent return visits to hospital for further treatment and painful surgery. The accident occurred in the respondent's teenage years, scarring her physically and emotionally at a critical time in her life. The scars remain (to an extent) and they will remain throughout her life. The award for general damages was within an acceptable range. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 (use of written submissions in the form of the Schedule of Damages) 
       
      
    39Â Â Â  It is convenient to address ground 8 before ground 7. The Schedule of Damages is set out at par 8 above. 
     
      
    40Â Â Â  The blunt and largely undeveloped submission of the appellant that the trial judge ought not to have allowed counsel to provide written submissions to the jury deserves an equally blunt: â€œWhy not?â€. The particular Schedule is a helpful summary that must have been of assistance to the jury. Its use as an aide memoire went without protest and was matched by the appellantâ€™s use of its own Schedule.  
     
      
    41Â Â Â  The Court was not referred to any case law on the broader issue. Even in the criminal law it may be appropriate for a summary to go to a jury, although the court retains a wide discretion, the practice is exceptional and demonstrated assistance to the jury (not just to a party) is critical (see Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 190, Tripodina and Morabito v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 183, Savvas (1989) 45 A Crim R 38).

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR:1 Andrew Schofield was working at Gosford Railway Station in the early hours of the morning of 12 March 2004 as a senior transit officer. Sometime after 3.30am two brothers, Sebastian and Christian Whitbread arrived at the station intending to travel by train to Wyong. Both had consumed copious quantities of alcohol. As each arrived at the station he was still husbanding a last bottle of Bacardi mix. 2 As events turned out their consumption of alcohol, coupled with their drunken behaviour would have consequences impacting on their lives and the lives of others for several years following. 3 Their time at this station ended shortly after 4pm when Andrew Schofield and other Transit officers manhandled each, removing each brother from the station in circumstances I shall come to. Each complained to the police who took them into their custody at the behest of the Transit officers believing each had been arrested by the Transit officers. 4 The police charged Andrew Schofield and five other Transit officers with assault of each youth. The hearing of these matters before His Honour Magistrate Miszalski appears to have been a cause celebre in the Gosford Local Court, taking eleven days to finalise.5 His Honour dismissed the charges of assault against the other co-accused. His Honour convicted Andrew Schofield of both counts of common assault. For reasons not made clear to me the appeal has been moved out of the Gosford district. It comes before me sitting at the Downing Centre District Court. This Court in determining this appeal has before it the relevant depositions and exhibits that were before his Honour. 6 The Courtâ€™s task is to review the evidence before the Local Court hearing the matter de nova that means, I am required to make my own findings of fact upon the evidence before the Local Court. I am required to form my own view as to whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each count.What the Crown Must Prove: 7 The Crown will do this if it is satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements of the charge, or put in laymanâ€™s terms the fundamental propositions contained in the charge sheets. It does not have to prove every adverse fact beyond reasonable doubt, what it must prove beyond reasonable doubt are a limited number of propositions: the date 12 March 2004; the alleged perpetrator Andrew Schofield, the appellant; the criminal act, the assault; and the victim in respect of count one Sebastian Whitbread, and in respect of count two Christian Whitbread.  
    8 An assault occurs when the perpetrator intentionally or recklessly commits an act, which causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. In this case, the prosecution says the act was a physical aggressive battery committed upon each without the consent of the either. In the case of each of the Whitbread youths there is undisputed evidence that the appellant intentionally committed an act, to use neutral term, aggressively manhandling of each, which caused each to apprehend immediate violence.The Defence Thesis: 9 The defence has sought to argue, however, that the violence was not unlawful. The defence case is that the acts were either lawful for one of two reasons of believed necessity by the appellant. The acts were believed necessary by the appellant for self defence, a proposition which the Crown must negative, or alternatively, or as well, the acts constituted a lawful removal of each from railway property in accordance with the provisions of regulation 58of the Railway Safety (General) Regulation 2003. The final possibility was that the acts constituted a lawful citizenâ€™s arrest pursuant to s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The burden of proving each of these lawful justifications rests with the defence on the balance of probabilities. The Legal Issues Defined: 10 Section 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence, if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self defence. A person carries out conduct in self defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary to defend himself, or to prevent criminal trespass to any land, or to remove a person from committing any such criminal trespass; and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceives them. Was there a lawful arrest?11 An arrest is the lawful seizing or apprehension of a subject, placing restraint upon his liberty for a purpose related to the administration of criminal justice. Such purpose may include presenting the subject before a lawful authority so that the person may be charged with an offence it is said he has committed. The parties agree the only power of arrest the appellant was able to exercise is the power provided at the relevant time by s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. 12 The parties agree Transit Officers are not constables or special constables. However, s352(1)(a) provided that a person may without warrant apprehend any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed an offence punishable on summary conviction under any Act. The Act required the person who carried out the arrest to take the person arrested and property found on him before an authorised justice to be dealt with according to law. An authorised justice is a Magistrate or justice employed in the Department of Courts Administration. 13 It is clear from the Interpretation Act 1987 that the term â€œActâ€ does not embrace â€œstatutory instrumentsâ€ see s20, s65 and s67 of also s100 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. I note s352 was repealed on 1 December 2005. 14 I have not been referred to any other power of arrest available to Transit Officers prior to 1 December 2005. As presently advised it does not appear to me the appellant had any power to arrest a person committing or immediately after having committed an offence on summary conviction under any other statutory instrument and in particular the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003. 15 Counsel for the appellant in written submissions argued that s95 of the Rail Safety Act 2002 allows for the making of regulations to create offences, that the offences so created provided they fall into subject constraints revealed by s 95(a) to s95(o) are offences created under the Rail Safety Act and therefore captured as relevant offences under s352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The argument goes that being so captured the powers of arrest created by s352(1)(a) apply. 16 However, the crucial issue is the mechanism by which the manner of punishment is determined that is, whether the offence is to be punishable on indictment or summarily. In this case, the mechanism by which that punishment is determined is by the penalty imposed see; s6(c) of the Criminal Procedure Act. By virtue of the maximum penalty being five penalty units, an offender would fall within the definition of a summary offender. 17 The Common Law powers of arrest on the other hand appear to be limited to cases where treason or felony have actually been committed or attempted, or there is a danger of such offences being committed, or a breach of peace had actually been committed, or is reasonably apprehended. A breach of the peace is sufficient to justify arrest when there is an actual assault, public alarm and incitement are created by the offenderâ€™s wrongful act, or when a person obstructs a public officer in the execution of his duty. Mere annoyance, disturbance, insult or abuse of language, even of great heat and fury, without personal violence are not sufficient generally to establish breach of the peace. Nobody has sought to argue that the Transit Officers are relevantly a public officer. 18 While it is true a servant may have authority to arrest on behalf of his master it is generally limited to cases where the arrest is reasonably necessary for the protection of the masterâ€™s property. Neither of the parties has been relying on the Common Law power of arrest. 19 The Rail Safety (General) Regulations 2003 created offences appear to be from regulation 13 through to 38 and include in regulation 13, for instance, conduct generally; regulation 15 smoking; regulation 17 drinking and alcohol generally prohibited; regulation 18 passengers who are intoxicated. 20 Regulation 39 gives to an authorised officer a power to direct a person to leave a train, railway land or part of monorail works in the event that the authorised officer comes to a view someone is committing an offence under this Part, meaning between regulation 13 and regulation 21. Regulation 58 gives to an authorised officer a power to remove from a train or land a person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the Rail Safety (General) Regulation. Part 3 of the regulation relates to conduct on trains and railways. 21 Each of the clauses 13 to 38 creates at least one offence, some clauses create two offences. Offences range from drinking alcohol, use of offensive language, smoking, intoxication, hindering anotherâ€™s use of a facility and so on. That is to say there is a limited range of circumstances in which an authorised person or authority can direct a person to leave railway property. 22 Clauses 18 and clause 39 empower authorised officers to direct persons to leave railway property. If circumstances permit the authorised personnel should indicate the offence or offences, which in his or her opinion a person is committing, whereby the authorised person is authorised to direct the offender to leave. 23 Where such circumstances do exist it seems to me a direction formulated simply as, â€œYou are not allowed to be hereâ€, (the witness, Singh, 22 August 2005 p46, line 55), or â€œIâ€™m giving you a direct order to leave the station,â€ (the appellant Schofield, 19 July 2005, p13, line 39) is inadequate. The Evidence: 24 The evidence establishes that Christian and Sebastian Whitbread arrived at Gosford Railway Station together. They had been drinking since at least 8pm perhaps earlier. They were still drinking their last drink at 3.30am the following morning. They were asked to and did, in fact, leave the station to finish this drink. At some point shortly thereafter they returned. They were asked by a Transit Officer for a ticket. When it was discovered neither had a ticket they were told to purchase one from a nearby ticket vending machine. 25 At least one of the youths protested loudly and in language that was unseemly and on occasions offensive. This conversation was not on the station platform proper but rather on a concrete ramp leading from the station platform to Showground Road. 26 There is no doubt the youths were on railway property and quite possibly that property is adequately described as â€œthe stationâ€. 27 At the outset of the incident the Court is concerned with the group comprised Christian and Sebastian Whitbread and six Transit officers. At this point in time Transit Officer Sanderson was directing the two youths to leave the station. Whether the direction was given pursuant to clause 18 or clause 39 or both is unclear, because I am satisfied Sanderson did not give a reason. I am satisfied Sebastian Whitbread was using offensive language, behaving offensively and under the influence of intoxicating liquor. I am also satisfied Christian Whitbread was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and generally supportive of his brother. But at this point in time I am not satisfied he was using offensive language or behaving offensively. 28 The appellant, who had dealt with the two brothers some minutes earlier, returned after having a cigarette. The evidence is that he heard Sebastian Whitbread refusing a direct order to leave the station. The appellantâ€™s evidence is that Sebastian Whitbread said, â€œIâ€™m not fucking leaving; youâ€™ll have to make me leave; I'm catching the Wyong train.â€ The appellantâ€™s evidence is Sebastian said, â€œIâ€™ve just been released from Lithgow Prison and I know my rights.â€ 29 The evidence establishes Sebastian had been to prison, but never to Lithgow, and he had not been â€œJust released,â€ but had been out for some months. Further, an analysis of the sentence demonstrates it to be a non sequitur. I have serious reservations about whether Sebastian Whitbread ever owned up to being at Lithgow Prison. I accept he may well have said, â€œI know my rights.â€ 30 When the appellant joined this group, on his evidence he said, â€œI thought you blokes had given me assurances that you would behave yourselves. I am giving you a direct order to leave the station.â€ That order was apparently on the basis that Sebastian Whitbread was continuing to abuse Sanderson, that is, behaving in an offensive manner. 31 The appellantâ€™s evidence is Sebastian Whitbread said, â€œI will kill you cunts if you try.â€ The appellantâ€™s evidence is, it is the uttering of these words that caused him to approach Sebastian Whitbread and take hold of him. The appellant says Sebastian resisted, his shirt gave way and ripped, and he wrestled him to the ground. It was during this struggle that Christian Whitbread ran towards him in a threatening manner. The appellant says, he took hold of him and got him to the ground. During that struggle Christian Whitbread abused him, spat in his direction at his face and dug his fingernails into the appellantâ€™s right calf muscle so that the appellant felt pain.32 Elsewhere in his evidence the appellant says Sebastian Whitbread was extremely abusive, threatening, intoxicated and he did not know whether Sebastian was carrying weapons or on drugs. Elsewhere the appellant says:â€œI wanted to restrain his [Sebastianâ€™s] movement. I came in with a right hand grabbed his collar area and intended to come around with my left hand behind his back to completely restrain his movements; therefore he could not use his knees or anything else...he resisted immediately and thatâ€™s how his, I mean, if I had got an open hand, how did I rip his shirt. I mean, his shirt has been ripped from the collar.â€ 33 It is noteworthy the appellant said in respect of Sebastian:â€œI was trying to bring my right hand onto his collar and the bottom part of my right hand was on his collar bone, I had hold of him there, I was bringing his left arm in. This was just a removal. There was no intention to go any further. However, by coming in close and tight like this I was prepared for this bloke to react violently, because he was ready to go and from what heâ€™d said there was the grey area.â€ 34. As to Christian, the appellant said:â€œI would not take any risk with that fellow, because he was in total support of his brother. He would have run through a brick wall for him...They were both fairly juiced up. I canâ€™t recall what was being said, but I found them to be intimidating, aggressive and there was a possibility of being assaulted.â€35 At this point it is worth pausing to note all of the actions of the parties have been recorded on CCTV. While it is possible to observe that conversation is taking place there is no audio sound. 36 So there is the oral evidence of the conversation and the body language of the participants that give some insight into the conversation. The CCTV, of course, clearly exposes the actions of all of the parties involved. 37 The CCTV and the oral evidence appear to establish that in the moments leading up to the manhandling incident, Christian Whitbread was passive, taking little or no part in the conversation, but standing with his brother as Sebastian did most of the talking. I am of the view the reason for requiring Christian to leave the station has to be a different reason to the reason requiring Sebastian to leave. Yet that difference does not appear to have articulated by anyone when they were required to leave.38 Secondly, the body language of Sebastian in the moments prior to him being manhandled does not appear to be consistent with the threatening conversation alleged against him. Nor does the body language of those surrounding Sebastian appear to be consistent with a threat being uttered in the moments prior to the appellant handling him. It is clear from the appellantâ€™s body language that he is gesticulating in a direction behind Christopher towards the CCTV camera 32. Yet when in the process of removing the men, the removal heads in a direction away from the camera. 39 I have now looked at that portion of the video a second time, and in fairness, there is seconds before the gesture in the direction of the camera, a gesture with the left hand in a direction opposite to the camera. 40 When Sebastian responds, he also gestures towards the camera. Then he drops both his hands down in a relaxed motion as though his hands were at rest one each side of his body. At this point there appears to be no conversation. The appellantâ€™s hands are also hanging by his side. That in a sense was unusual, because for most of the time he was visible on the CCTV the appellantâ€™s arms had been folded. Sebastian takes a half step backwards away from the appellant towards Transit Officer John Borcher who is standing with both arms folded across his chest behind Sebastian. Melchor Jaminez is resting his back against the glass wall. Christopher Sanderson stands about one and a half metres in front of Sebastian. He too has his arms folded across his chest resting on his stomach. Geoffrey Blight stands to the left of John Borcher, his hands appear to be hanging loosely by his sides. Reilly, the security guard, and Transit Officer Sinha are a metre and a half or so away from Christian Whitbread, they appear to be relaxed. 41 There are two Transit officers off camera behind Christian Whitbread who from time to time appear to be chatting to each other when they are captured by the camera. Christian Whitbread has his left arm hanging loosely and his right arm bent at right angles, but his elbow in against his side. 42 In the instant before the appellant lunges, the only person captured in the CCTV number 32 frame at seven minutes fifty five seconds, who appears to be stressed, is the appellant. In my view, such a scenario is entirely inconsistent with the sense of confrontation painted by the appellant on his evidence. 43 When Sebastian Whitbread moved the half step back the appellant almost immediately moved suddenly towards him, raising both arms towards Sebastianâ€™s shoulders, one each side of the neck. In the CCTV footage from camera 32 itâ€™s impossible to observe the appellantâ€™s left hand. I should indicate that I have relied on camera 29 to come to a view that both hands were raised by the appellant when he approached Sebastian. The appellantâ€™s right hand travels along the top of Sebastianâ€™s left shoulder towards his left ear. Whether it grabs the left ear lobe, or applies pressure to a pressure point in the neck region immediately below the earlobe, is impossible to tell from the picture frames. 44 Sebastian is turned to his left through 30 to 40 degrees. The appellant moves in so that his chest is abutting Sebastianâ€™s right shoulder. Sebastianâ€™s head is now tilted backwards from the perpendicular some 15 or 20 degrees by the force of the appellantâ€™s hand against Sebastianâ€™s jaw line or pressure point. Sebastianâ€™s left arm is grabbing the appellantâ€™s right wrist area as though trying to release such grip or pressure as the appellant has on him. 45 I am satisfied the appellantâ€™s right arm is making contact with Sebastian somewhere around the earlobe, upper neck region, although the nature of that contact I cannot determine specifically. Jaminez, Sanderson, Reilly, Christian and Blight have not reacted. Borcher is moving towards Sebastian. As best I can tell the appellant thrusts or pushes Sebastian with both hands downwards and against the glass wall. By this time the left side of Sebastianâ€™s shirt is torn, revealing part of his left torso. My view is that any tearing occurred as a consequence of whatever the Appellant's left hand was doing. Borcher and another person, probably Jaminez, scoop up or try to scoop up Sebastian. The appellant is now a metre and a half from Sebastian. The appellant is on his feet standing erect. Sebastian is doubled over and is in or almost in the custody of the two other Transit Officers. 46 I am satisfied the pushing of Sebastian away has significance. If the appellant was truly fearful of Sebastianâ€™s threat to kill or his possible possession of weapons, it is unlikely he would have pushed Sebastian free, even if only for a second, but crowded him as he earlier had, giving Sebastian no chance to reach for the weapon or otherwise advance his threat to kill. Nor is anything said to any of the other Transit Officers so far as I can tell about the threat to kill or the possible presence of a weapon. Whatever the appellant was doing, it was not about smothering a threat to kill or being alarmed about the potential for the presentation of a weapon. 47 Regulation 58 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003 permits an authorised officer to remove any person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under the regulation. I am prepared to accept that the appellant genuinely believed he had given an authorised direction. However, only reasonable force can be used for such a purpose. Further, the use of force would need to be a reasonable option in all of the circumstances. The circumstances that were occurring at about 4am were these: 
     
      
     Minimal public traffic in the region; 
      
     This is not a case where any member of the public was endangered by the behaviour of Sebastian or his brother; 
      
     So far as I can tell the only people to interact with the brothers were the Transit Officers who at all times outnumbered the brothers; 
      
     Neither brother was presenting any danger by the way in which he was behaving; 
      
     Sebastian certainly was rowdy and offensive at least towards the Transit Officers; 
      
     The police had not been called; 
      
     Nor was any threat made by the Transit officers to call police if the men failed to comply with the directions; 
      
     No infringement notice had been issued; and 
      
     No attempt to escort either brother from the station had been made. 
    48 I am satisfied the use of force at the time the appellant grabbed Sebastian was not a reasonable option in all the circumstances. It is to be remembered the onus is on the defence to prove it was a reasonable option. Even if I be wrong in that assessment I am satisfied the use of force was far in excess of the force required to effect a removal. Again, the onus is on the defence to prove that the force was reasonable in all the circumstances. Further, I am satisfied there was no warrant for the appellant to approach Sebastian by way of self defence. At that stage Sebastian was outnumbered by eight or nine to two - assuming his brother was willing to assist him. It should be clear I do not regard the appellant as seeking to effect an arrest. Nor in my view was there any power to arrest him in the circumstances. 49 It follows that the appellant intentionally committed an act, which caused Sebastian Whitbread to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. I find the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant assaulted Sebastian Whitbread. 50 The position in respect of Christian Whitbread is different. At the point where the appellant had pushed Sebastian towards the glass wall he stepped back. His assault upon Sebastian was at this point over. Sebastian was then in, or almost in the custody of two other officers who were in the process of securing him with a view to removing him from the railway station. For a brief moment Sebastian did break free and sought to approach the appellant in an aggressive way. But that situation plays little part in Christian Whitbreadâ€™s conduct. 51 To the point where his brother was assaulted by the appellant Christian Whitbread had been relatively passive. However, once the appellant disengaged from his actions with Sebastian, Christian Whitbread approached him. I have no doubt he was complaining about the way in which his elder brother had been treated by the appellant. 52 While he did not run but rather stepped forward one, or perhaps two steps, he was gesticulating with his right arm at about shoulder height. True, his hand was not in a fist, but that would not have taken long to accomplish. All this was being done while he was in what the appellant described as his â€œpersonal space.â€ 53 The appellant, no doubt, well knew that Christian Whitbread was upset by what had happened, and was happening to his brother and blamed the appellant for it. The appellant had every reason to fear an assault upon him by Christian Whitbread. The appellant responded by placing each of his hands on Christianâ€™s arms gripping the left arm at Christianâ€™s elbow and moving towards the right elbow. The appellant swung Christian around and slid his hand under Christianâ€™s left armpit and would, it seems to me, have escorted him from the railway station had not other matters intervened. In my view, there was nothing untoward or inappropriate about the appellantâ€™s response at that point in time. 54 Sanderson began to move towards Christian. The other officers were crowding in seeking to secure Christian. At this point Sebastianâ€™s left hand is reaching towards the appellant. The Transit Officers thereafter removed both men from the railway station. 55 It is to be remembered the appellant cannot be expected to weigh with jewellerâ€™s scales all the issues one might think of with hindsight. The force he first tried to use was appropriate. The escalation occurred because of the acts of Christian Whitbread. I regard the acts of the appellant, in respect of Christian Whitbreadâ€™s acts and movements, done in self defence. 56 Thereafter the acts of the other Transit officers were done pursuant to a removal presumably in accordance with cl58. I am not concerned with whether the force used in that removal was excessive. The parties agree that the incident I am focusing on is the incident occurring on the ramp way to the Showground Road captured by camera 32. 57 My formal findings are these: 
     
     I find the appellant guilty of common assault of Sebastian Whitbread.  
      
     I find the prosecution has failed to prove the appellant was guilty of assaulting Christian Whitbread. What do you seek to do now, Mr Doyle? 
    Submissions made:58 HIS HONOUR: My own view of it, is that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of a s10 discharge. The finding of guilt will have significant consequences upon him. He has for thirty years been associated with those in society, primarily here, but also for a while in New Zealand, who are least likely to comply with the requirements of observing peace and behaving lawfully. It would seem that he has done his job well. 59 At four in the morning on 12 March 2004 for whatever reason, he appears to have had a brain explosion. It appears to me entirely out of character. It will have significant consequences for him. He has fought tooth and nail to establish that he behaved lawfully. He has been unsuccessful at least in respect of one charge although he has succeeded in respect of the other. 60 It may well have been a different situation had the Magistrate convicted him only of the one, rather than the two offences. My own view is that the Magistrate would not have been out of order to fine him, but the justice that I would seek to administer would also seek to pay some regard to the tremendous contribution that he has made to the society by taking on work that is difficult, stressful and sometimes dangerous. 61 I am satisfied he made a very bad error of judgment on this night but I intend to discharge him without conviction. 62 The formal orders I make are these: 
     
     The conviction recorded by the learned Magistrate in respect of Christian Whitbread is quashed. The  
      
     Finding of guilt recorded by the learned Magistrate in the matter of Sebastian Whitbread is confirmed, however, the conviction is quashed.  
      
     Pursuant to s10 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      I discharge the appellant from conviction.

2764866,New South Wales Crime Commission v Gibbs [2014] NSWSC 1383,"Judgment

1By summons filed on 23 September 2014, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in property of the defendant, Stephen Allan Gibbs. Ancillary orders under s 12(1) of the Act were also sought, as well as orders under s 27 and other orders. 

2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 25 September 2014 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations) and authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.

3For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.

4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Rooty Hill, a motor cycle and funds held in an account with Newcastle Permanent Building Society.

5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Gibbs had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a prohibited drug (cannabis sativa plant), contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

6Mr Spark provided a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts sheet prepared by Senior Constable Salvador of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Gibbs' arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Senior Constable Salvador about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, RMS and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by Newcastle Permanent. 

7This material disclosed that Mr Gibbs has been charged with offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 after an investigation into the cultivation of cannabis sativa plants. Police surveillance resulted in Mr Gibbs' arrest in June 2014 at the Rooty Hill property which had been converted for the purpose of growing cannabis sativa plants by enhanced means, using hydroponic cultivation. Three hundred and forty seven plants at various growing stages, with a value estimated to be of $1,735,000, were found in the property.

8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of motor vehicles and funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Gibbs is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 

9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 

10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the other orders sought. 

11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 

Orders

12I accordingly make orders in the terms sought.

4The property in question is identified in a schedule to the summons. It includes one property located at Wilton and another located at Berridale, of which the defendant is a joint tenant, as well as funds held in an account held in ING Direct and a share held in Maxwell Investments (Aust) Pty Ltd.
5Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Maxwell had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of ""serious criminal offences"" in s 6 of the Act, namely, ""supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 
6Mr Spark gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. It rested on a consideration of a Police Facts Sheet prepared by Detective Piggott of the New South Wales Police Force in relation to Mr Maxell's arrest on 16 June 2014; answers provided to questions he asked of Detective Piggott about the Facts Sheet; information obtained from searches conducted by Crime Commission officers the COPS, ASIC and LPI databases and documents produced to the Commission by ING. 
7This material disclosed that Mr Maxwell has been charged with offences under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act after an investigation into the involvement of a co-accused in the supply of drugs. Police surveillance recorded Mr Maxwell and his co-accused discussing cannabis ordered by Mr Maxwell and on later arrest, bags containing cannabis totalling 20 pounds were found in the boot of his car, together with other items of interest, mobile phones and cash. After arrest, Mr Maxwell made admissions to police as to the purchase of the cannabis for some $58,000 and provided a signed witness statement. Further investigations resulted in the discovery of other cannabis and large amounts of cash.
8Mr Spark deposed to his experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Maxwell is apparently involved, that he should not be given notice of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit. 
9Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. 
10I am satisfied that the material which is relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought. 
11On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days' notice. 
12Given that Mr Maxwell is but one of the joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties, I take the view that the orders which I propose to make should also be served upon the other joint tenants of the two properties and that they, too, should be given liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice. In coming to that view, I have had regard to their rights under s 10C of the Act.
Orders
13I accordingly make orders in the terms sought and also order and direct that:(1)The orders be served on the other joint tenants of the Wilton and Berridale properties.
(2)They have liberty to apply to the Court on 3 days' notice.
(3)That a copy of these reasons be served with the orders.

2763475,NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2014] NSWSC 278,"JUDGMENT

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed in May 2010. On 13 May 2010, Buddin J made ex parte orders pursuant to s 10A and other provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) restraining all of the interests in property of the first defendant Jason Lee being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that he had engaged in serious crime related activity. 

2In June 2012 orders were sought under s 27 of the Act against the fourth defendant, Seong Won lee. On 19 June, Hidden J made an order s 10A restraining all of the interests in property of the fourth defendant.

3Consent orders were made in September 2012 under s 10B, for the reasonable legal expenses of the two defendants, in relation to a number of specified matters. 

4A further consent order was made in June 2013 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal in relation to their conviction for drug supply and firearm offences. 

5A further consent order under s 10B was made in November 2013 in respect of their reasonable legal expenses incurred in respect of these proceedings, that order was varied by consent in December 2013.

6A further consent order was made in January 2014 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for the High Court appeal. 

7On 14 March 2014, the parties asked the Court to make further consent orders varying these earlier consent orders, by inserting in schedule two to the orders, two further properties located at Chifley and Waterloo. That was explained for the plaintiff to reflect that these properties have now been sold, realizing proceeds which are available for payment of legal expenses still outstanding in relation to the matters the subject to the earlier consent orders. 

8Having considered the circumstances in which the parties seek the making of the proposed further consent order and the terms of that order I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's powers be exercised to make orders in the terms agreed. 

9For those reasons, I made orders in terms of the consent orders filed on 14 March 2014.

REASONS FOR JU3GMENT 

This  appeal  from  the  conviction  for  murder of  James  Edward 
of  the  Northern 

Albert  Little,  the  appellant,  in  the  Supreme  Court 
Territory Gas heard  by  this  Court on  21 August 1985 at  Darwln. 

The appellant  was  represented  by  counsel  at  the  crial,  but 

appeared in person to argue  his  case  on  this  appeal.  However,  counsel 
sought  to  appear  a s   amlcus  c-urlae  and  arrangements  were  made for  the 
appellant  to  confer  with  counsel  before  the  commencement  of  the 
hearing of  this  appeal.  We  are  much  indebte6 to counsel  who  appeared 
as  amicus  curiae  for  his  assistance  to  the  appellant  and  to  this
--------
Court.  After  courisel 

had  completed  his  submissions  as amicus  curiae 

. 

2 .  

the  appellant  said  that he did  not  wish  to  say  anything  himself  to  the 
Court  and  was  content to adopt  the  submissions of counsel. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  argument  the  Court  disrnlssed  the 

appeal  and  announced that its  reasons  would  be  published  later.  These 
are  the  reasons  which  led  me  to  join 

in the  dismissal of  the  appeal. 

The  trial  commenced  in  Darwin  on  Tuesday,  4  DecemSer 1984. 

During that day  seven  Crown  witnesses  had  given  their  evidence  and  an 
eighth  had  completed  his evidence-in-chief.  '&-en  the  trial  resumed on 
Wednesday, 5  December,  counsel  for  the  appellant  applied  to  the  trial 
Judge in the  absence  of  the  Jury for  the  discharge of the  Jury.  The 
basis of  the  application  was an article  which  appeared  that  morning  as 
headline  news  on  the  front  page  cf  the  ""Midweek  Territorian"", 
a 
newspaper  havlng  a wide  clrculation  in  Darwin  and  its  envlrons.  The 
article  contained  a  number 
inaccurate  and  prejudicial  to  the  accused  and  to  seriously  impair  hls 
prospects  cf a fair  trial. 

of  statements  which  were  said  to  be 

The  statements  to  which  exception was taken  ace  as  follows: 

the  following  statement  in  the 

f x s t   paragraph  of  the 

(a) 
article: 

..  . 

+ 

""A  man confessed  to  police  that 
traveller  in  the  back  near  Daly  Watsrs,  the 
Supreme  Court  yesterday."" 

he  had  shot  a 
N.T.
--------
the  third  paragraph  of  the  article  stated  that  the  appellant 

(b) 
""had  confessed to Darwin  Police two days  after  the shooting"". 

after  a  reference  to  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  woken  up 

(C) 
after  daylight  and  there  was  a  car  nearby,  the  artlcle  stated  that  the 
appellant  ""went  to  hls  bike  and  some 

of his  possesslons  were  misslng"". 

the  sixteenth  paragraph  of  the  arlccle  then  purported  to 

(d) 
state  the  precise  words of  the  appellant In  relation  to  the  shooting 
namely, ""I couldn't  remember how It happened ... I just  remember I hac! 
the rifle, he had his back  to  me  and I shot  hlm  a  couple  of times"". 

The  trial  Judge  declined 

CO  discharge  the  Jury  after 

considerable discussion  had  taken  place  about  the  matter  between  Bench 
and  Bar.  The  Jury  was  then  recalled  and  hls  Honour explxned to  them 
why  the  trial  had  been  Interrupted.  He drew  thezr  acEsntion to some 
of  the  statements  to which  exceptlon  had  been  taken. He told  the  Jury 
in essence  that  each  of  the  statements  was  not an accurate  account of 
what had  occurred  In Cou-t the  previous  day  and he told  the  Jury wh17 
each  scatement  was  Inaccurate.  His  Honour  sal?  thar; the  artlcle  Yas 

not  very  carefully  written,  that  it  was  mislea2mg  and  contained ""a 
good  deal of mischief"".  His  Honour  then  proceeded  to  tell  the  Jurors 
that he  would  not  discharge  them,  that  they  must  put  the  article  and 
its  contents o u t   of  thelr  minds  and  judge  the facts of  the  case op. the 
evidence  before  them  and  nothing  else.
--------
The  discharge  of  juries 

is-dealt with  in  S.  371 of  the 

Criminal  Code of  the  Northern  Territorv  which  provides: 

4. 

""371(1)  When  the  trial  of

may  discharge  the ~ury. 

an  accused  person  is

jury  without  giving 
a 
verdict  and  may  direct  that a  fresh jury  be  sworn

of  the  court  o r   may 
ad~ourn the  trial. 

(3)  Such  an  exercise  of discretion  1 s   not 

subject  to  review by any  court."" 

The scope  and  meanlng  of  S.  371  was  not  argued  before  us. 

The  argument  as  to  the  Supreme  Court's  powers  to  dlscharge 
proceeded  on  the  assumptlon  that  the  comman 
law applied. 

~uries 

Applications  to  Judges  presiding  over  criminal  trials  are  not 

of unfair  or 

on the  basls 

infrequently  made  to  dlscharge  juries 
pre~udicial newspaper  reports  of  the  trial.  The  decision  to  discharge 
or  not  to  discharge a ~ury is  essentially a matter  for  the  trlal  Judge 
in  the  exercise  of his  discretion.  If  in  exercising  his  dlscretion 
not  to  discharge  the  jury  a trial  Judge  applies  wrong  principles  or 
seriously  misconceives  the  meanixg  of  the  newspaper  article  or  Its 
rlght to  a fair 
likely  prejudiciai  effect  Lpon  the  accused  or  hls

The  newspaper  article  did  say 

that  there  was  a  ""Furdsr 

that

concern  to  the  appellant  because,  although  the  Jury  had  besn  told 
the  shooting  was  attributed  to  the  accused,  there  remained  the 
important  question  of  intent  and  this  had  not  been  the sub~ect of a 
confession.  The  appellant  was  concerned  that  the  Jury  might  forn  the 
impression that  the  record  of  Interview  to  be  tendered  amounted  to a, 
confession of  murder.-  The  -trial Judge  did  tell  the  Jury  that  m a

Judge  to  the  Jury  concerned 
submitted  that,  although  his  Honour  instructed  the  Jury  that  under 
31  they  should  consider  that  the  discharge  of  the  rifle  occurred

the  rifle  was  intended  or  foreseen  by  the  appellant.  This  argument 
gas based on sub-S.  31(1)  of  the  Crimlnal  Code  which  providss: 

S. 

A  person  is  excused  from  crininal 

""31(1) 
responsibility  for  an act, omission or  event  unless 
it  was  intended  or  foreseen  by  him  as  a posslble 
consequence  of his  conduct."" 

The  words  ""act""  and  ""event"" are  defined 

by S.  1 of  the 

Criminal  Code as follows:- 

""'act',  in  relation  to an accused  person,  means  the 
deed  alleged  to  have  been  done  by  him:  it  is  not 
limited  to  bodily  movement  and  it  includes  the  deed

of  another  caused, 
done pursuant  to a common  intentlcn.
--------
'event'  means  the  result  of an act or  omission."" 

7 .  - 

Counsel  appearing  amicus  curiae  argued  that  the  definition 
""act"" in the  Criminal  Code of  the  Northern  Terrltory  is  somewhat  wider 
than  the  corresponding  definition  of  the  word  in  the  Queensland 
Criminal  Code  which  was  considered  by  the  High  Court  in  Kaporonowski 
v.  R_.  (1973) 1 A.L.R.  296. 

of 

A  reading of his  Honour's  charge  to  the  Jury 

as a whole  shows 
be 

Jury that  tney  had  to 

plainly  that  his  Honour  did  instruct  the 
satisfied  beyond  reasonable  doubt  not  only  that  the  appellant  shot  the 
vlctlm  but  also  that  he  Intended  to  kill 
hlm,  or at  least  inflict 
serious  bodily  harm  upon  him.  His  Honour  also  brought  to  the  Jury's 
attention  the  substance of  the  matters  to which S.  6  of  the  Criminal 
Code  is  directed  relating  to  the  presumption  of  normality of  mind  of 
an  accused  person  until  the  contrary  is  proved.  There  was  no 
substance  in  this  branch  of  the  appellant's  argument. 

The third  ground  of  attack on the  summlng  up  was  that  the 

crial  Judge  was  said  not  to  have  fairly  put  the  defence  case  to  the 
Jury.  It was  submitted  that  the  appellant's  case  was  put  only  brisfly 
to  the  Jury, towards  the  close  of  the  summing  up and  constituted  a 
disproportionately  small  part of the  charge  to  the  Jury.  I carefully 
read  the  trial  Judge's  charge  to  the  Jury  and  was  satlsfied  that  there 

was  no  substance  in  this gro&d 

of  attack. 

The final matter  relled on on behalf  of  the  appellant  has  Its 

genesis  in  a  sentence  of a charge to the  Jury  where  hls  Honour  said
--------
.... 

8. 

that  the  evidence  was  that  the  victim  had  been  shot  three  times  by 
projectiles  that  came  from  the  appellant's  rifle.  it  was 
smmitted 
that  this  statement  to  the 
on two 
grounds:  first, in that  it was  said  to  have  been put  by his Hor?our  to 
the  Jury as an established  fact  yet  that  was  a  matter  essentially  for 
the  Jury  to  decide  and;  second,  because  his  Honour was  sald to have 
rnlsconceived  the  effect  of  the  expert  balllstic  evidence  adduced  in 
the  Crown case. 

Jury constituted  a  misdirection 

The  trial  Judge  commenced  his  charge  to  the  Jury  by saying 
a 
that  one  of  the  objects  to  be  achieved 
summary  or  review of,the evidence  for  the  Jury  and of  the  submlsslons 
of counsel  with  respect  to  that  evidence  ""in  the  hope  that  It  will 
assist you in  arriving  at a  verdict  when you retire"".  A  little  later 
hls  Honour  said  to  the  Jury:- 

by  his  summing  up  was  to  nake 

""On the other  hand, your  function 1s to decide  the 
facts of the case,  and  just as I am the sole  judge 
of the  law, then  you are  the  sole  judges  of  che 
facts.  That's your  exclusive  province  aEd  it  is 
not  one  wit  less important  than  ny function.  And 
so,  you  being  the  sole  judges  of the  facts, it's 
not  for  me to control  or  influence  you  in  any  way 
in  your  decision  on those  facts,  and I  tell you 
now,  that if  in the  course  of  what I have  to  say tc

s 57(1)(e) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed)
 
: This was an appeal against the decision of District Judge Audrey Lim when she convicted the appellant, Soh Lip Hwa (`Soh`), of an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) for employing a China national, Zhou Xi Qiu, who had entered Singapore without a valid pass. Soh was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge against the appellant read as follows: 
 
You, Soh Lip Hwa, Male/44 years, NRIC No. S2584327D, are charged that you, from a day in Jan 2000 till 8th day of March 2000, at various locations in Singapore, did employ one Zhou Xi Qiu [commat] Zhou Xi Qun, a China National, as general worker, whom you had reasonable grounds for believing to be a person who had acted in contravention of Section 6(1) of the Immigration Act; Chapter 133, by entering Singapore without being in possession of a Valid Pass issued by Controller of Immigration, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act Chapter 133 and punishable under Section 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 The undisputed facts 
 
 
 
 
 
On 8 March 2000, Sgt Koh Ah Seng was on patrol duty when he was despatched to Block 749, Jurong West Street 73, [num ]12-143. He saw two China nationals, namely, Huang Xin Hwa (`Huang`) and Zhou Xi Qiu (`Zhou`) working in that unit which was under renovation at that time. They were unable to produce any documents when requested and were arrested. They were subsequently charged in court and convicted for being illegal immigrants.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
Soh was employed as a supervisor in a company known as Tops and Hui Design & Renovation (`Tops and Hui`), which was owned by one Ting See Sa Moi (`Ting`), since July 1999 when the company was first set up.
Soh`s job was to supervise the workers and the factory. According to Ting, every minor detail in the factory was handled by him. Soh was in charge of the workers and arranged for the workers to do their jobs at the project sites. When there was a project, drawings would be faxed to Ting. Soh would then arrange for the workers to go to the site and do all the measurements before commencing work. Every week he would advise Ting as to how much to pay the workers and she would withdraw the money from the bank for payment. If Ting was unable to do so, Soh could also withdraw the money to pay the workers, as Soh and Ting were joint signatories to the company`s bank account.
Soh was given almost complete control over the assignments given to Ting`s company. Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s approval or consent and he had done so previously. Ting did not raise any objections to that as she thought he was more familiar with that line of work.
In 1999, Soh brought two China nationals, namely Zhou and Huang, to see Ting and asked her whether she wanted to employ them. Ting told him no, as her company was very small. When Ting asked the two China nationals whether they had work permits, Huang showed her a work permit. Zhou did not do so. Ting claimed that she could not understand the contents of the work permit as she did not know English. She testified that Soh had seen the work permit and told her that the work permit was genuine. Ting told Huang that she had no work for him at that time and that she would contact him if she had any work for him. She made a copy of Huang`s work permit.
Soh had informed Ting of a contract for cleaning works at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. Soh was in charge of the work to be done in that unit. As Ting was not free to attend to this herself, Soh told her that he would send workers to do the job, and suggested sending Huang. Ting agreed to it and told Soh he could send the person whose work permit she had photocopied to do the work. Ting testified that she did not instruct Soh to employ Zhou.
During the course of the investigations, two handphones were seized by Investigating Officer SSgt Anan s/o Balakrishnan. One of the handphones was seized from Zhou. That handphone, bearing the number 97870275, was registered in the name of Soh and the phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address.
Ting testified that she had never purchased handphones for the company and had never given any handphone to anyone in the company. She never requested Soh to purchase handphones for the company. She also did not pay for Soh`s handphone or his handphone bills. Neither did she pay for any handphones or handphone bills for the workers.
 The defence 
 
 
 
Soh testified that he was formally employed by Ting from May 2000. Prior to that, he was employed by Home Shape Design and Construction (`Home Shape`), which was a company owned by Ting`s husband, Ngu Ting Tieh (`Ngu`). Soh would assist Ting whenever Ngu instructed him to do so.
Soh`s evidence was that, as a supervisor, he had no authority to employ any workers. His main job was to oversee the production line in the factory and he never went down to project sites. He acted on Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions and it was Ting, and not him, who was in charge of the day to day running of the business in Tops and Hui. According to Soh, Ting had told him of the work to be done at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. He testified that he was not in charge of the work to be conducted in that unit and did not supervise the workers for the project. However, he testified later that he had instructed workers to go to the unit to do work upon Ngu`s or Ting`s orders.
Soh got to know Zhou and Huang at a nearby canteen. One day both of them asked him whether any general work was available. Soh told them that they could ask Ngu at Home Shape. Soh brought them to see Ting and asked her whether she would employ them. Soh said that he did not see Ting check any work permit and was not aware whether she did so. However, he later testified that Ting told him after checking the work permit that it was genuine.
Soh`s defence was that it was Tops and Hui, and not he, who had employed Zhou and that Soh had acted on Ting`s instructions in sending Zhou to do the work. Zhou contacted Ting in the office to ask if there was any job for him. Ting told Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to report for work. Ting also paid $20 to him to be handed over to Zhou as Zhou`s salary for the work to be done.
Ting told Soh to apply for two handphone lines for the use of the company two to three years prior to 2000. At that time, Ting was at Home Shape. The handphone bearing the number 97870275 was the handphone that Home Shape instructed him to purchase. He handed this handphone to Zhou. The handphone was purchased for Home Shape, but the bill was sent to his residential address. According to Soh, this was because he did not bring an authorisation letter from Home Shape when he bought the handphone, but produced his identity card instead. He handed the phone bills to Home Shape for reimbursement or payment. He never asked Ngu whether he would pay or had paid the bills.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judge accepted Ting`s testimony that she had left Soh to supervise the work at the factory and on-site and to deploy and supervise workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without Ting`s consent was also accepted by the judge.
The judge found that Soh had brought Zhou and Huang to see her for employment. It was also found that Ting had asked to look at their work permits, and Huang produced one to Soh, who remarked that it was genuine and handed it to Ting. The judge believed Ting`s testimony that she had agreed to Soh`s suggestion in deploying Huang to do the cleaning work at the flat, as Huang had a work permit. Further, it was found by the judge that Ting never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou.
The judge found that there was clear indicia of employment by Soh. Firstly, in Soh`s long statement he admitted that he had informed Zhou that there was a job for him and asked him to come to work. Soh also demonstrated the work to Zhou and told him that he could return in one or two days. When Zhou returned, Soh directed him to do the cleaning work and gave him the address. The judge preferred Soh`s evidence in his long statement to his testimony in court, where he claimed that he had done all those things on Ting`s orders. Secondly, Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day. Thirdly, Soh gave Zhou a handphone registered in Soh`s name to contact him for work. The judge also found Soh to be an inconsistent, evasive and untruthful witness. For instance, Soh`s evidence was that he did not know that Zhou and Huang produced their work permits to Ting and he did not see Ting check their work permits. However, he later testified that Ting told him that the work permits were genuine. Under such circumstances, Soh must have known that Ting had checked their work permits. Another discrepancy noted by the trial judge was that Soh testified that he did not supervise workers or go to project sites and he only worked in the factory, but he also testified that he did instruct workers to go to the unit at Blk 749 upon Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions. Yet another inconsistency was that Soh kept referring to Ting as his boss during the trial and as his employer in the long statement, but he kept denying that he was employed by Ting at the material time. He maintained that his employer was Ngu at that time, but Ngu was never mentioned in his long statement as his employer. The judge rejected Soh`s explanation that he regarded Ting as his employer when the statement was recorded, because he was then working for Ting, and thus did not mention Ngu as his boss. The judge held that it was inconceivable how Soh could have forgotten to mention Ngu, if Ngu had been involved in any way.
Accordingly the judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Soh had employed Zhou at the material time and Soh was convicted. The judge imposed a sentence of one year`s imprisonment, taking into consideration the recent decisions of 
Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP
 (Unreported) , 
Tan Soon Meng v PP
 (Unreported) and 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
 .
 The motion to adduce additional evidence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh applied, by way of CrM 24/2001, for leave to adduce the following documents as additional evidence: 
(1) a faxed copy of Zhou Xi Qiu`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to one Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(2) a faxed copy of a letter from the Singapore Immigration & Registration (SIR) dated 12 February 2000 addressed to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(3) a copy of the original letter from the SIR dated 12 February 2000 to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(4) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the marriage of Zhou Xi Qiu to Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(5) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Zhou Xi Qiu; 
(6) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Lin Ming Qin; 
(7) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 27 May 2001; 
(8) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 20 June 2001.
The applicable provision in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) is s 257(1) which reads as follows: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter, the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or a Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
The principles in determining whether additional evidence is `necessary` were laid down in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  at 343, which adopted the test in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
: 
 
[F]irst it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 
 
 
This threefold test of non-availability, relevance and reliability has been applied in the recent cases of 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
 , 
Lee Yuen Hong v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
  and 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
 .
 (1)THE EVIDENCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED WITH REASONABLE DILIGENCE FOR USE AT THE TRIAL
In my view, the first condition was satisfied. There was no evidence to suggest that Soh knew at the time of the trial that Ting had helped Zhou`s wife apply for a social visit pass. It was also reasonable for Soh not to have suspected at the time of the trial that Ting had done so, as no evidence had been adduced to show that Ting had revealed this fact to anyone prior to the trial.
Soh might have known of the application if he had managed to contact Zhou before the trial. Soh had handed Zhou a handphone so that Soh could contact him if there was any work for him. Prior to the trial, Soh had attempted to contact Zhou by calling the phone numbers in China, as reflected on the handphone bills. In my view, this amounted to the exercise of reasonable diligence, but Soh was not able to contact Zhou prior to the trial and was thus unable to obtain evidence of the application.
 (2)THE EVIDENCE MUST BE SUCH THAT, IF GIVEN, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE RESULT OF THE CASE, ALTHOUGH IT NEED NOT BE DECISIVE
Counsel for Soh submitted that the letter from the SIR addressed to Ting regarding an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife indicated a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou, and their relationship was not limited to a mere acquaintanceship that was formed when Soh brought Zhou and Huang to see Ting. It was contended that this showed that Ting had been less than truthful during the trial. It was also submitted that in such circumstances it would be more likely that Zhou would have approached Ting rather than Soh for employment and it was Ting who subsequently employed Zhou.
I was of the opinion that the evidence in this case was sufficiently strong to prove that Soh employed Zhou. Ting, being the local sponsor, was required to declare her relationship with Zhou`s wife in the form for the application for a social visit pass. No evidence was adduced as to what was the relationship that Ting declared in the form. The fact that Ting had made an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife might suggest that the relationship between Ting and Zhou was more than a mere acquaintanceship. Nevertheless, the possibility of a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou would not have an important influence on the result of the case, as it was not sufficient to show that Soh did not employ Zhou. Furthermore, the inference that Ting might have employed Zhou due to their relationship being possibly more than an acquaintanceship was not a strong one.
The other documents, namely, the faxed copy of Zhou`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to Lin Ming Qin, the notarial certificate certifying the marriage of Zhou to his wife, the notarial certificates certifying the identities of Zhou and his wife and the DHL envelopes cum shipment airway bills, would also not have an important influence on the result of the case.
Since the second condition was not satisfied, the motion should be dismissed.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
The main issue in this case was whether Soh had in fact employed Zhou. Before deciding on that issue, I dealt with defence counsel`s argument that the judge had erred in fact when she accepted Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent.
Ting testified in court that Soh had the authority to employ workers without her approval, as he was more familiar with this line. It was contended by defence counsel that as far as foreign workers were concerned, only Ting would have the authority to employ them. Counsel submitted that this was evidenced by the fact that Ting would apply for work permits for her workers through her agent and that Soh had seen it fit to bring Zhou and Huang to see Ting to ask her whether she had jobs for them and whether she wanted to employ them. It was submitted that the fact that Ting had told Huang that she had no job for him at the moment and would contact him if she had any job for him also implied that only Ting had the authority to hire foreign workers.
It is well settled that an appellate court would not readily disturb the trial judge`s finding of fact. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , it was held that: 
 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 
 
 
This principle has been applied by the Court of Appeal in several recent cases: 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ; 
Abdul Ra`uf bin Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 683
 .
In my view, this finding of fact was not reached against the weight of the evidence. Ting testified that she and Soh were joint signatories to the bank account of Tops and Hui from which Soh was able to withdraw money to pay the workers and other expenses. In addition, she stated that Soh was able to tell how much each worker was worth according to their craftsmanship and would advise her how much to pay the workers every week. In my view, these facts showed the trust that Ting had in Soh and the extent of Soh`s responsibility in Tops and Hui.
Counsel for Soh submitted that, in giving such testimony, Ting was trying to distance herself from the employment of Zhou and to shift all responsibility to Soh. However, it must be noted that Soh did not dispute the fact that he held a joint account with Ting, that he was able to withdraw money from the account to pay the workers and that he determined the salaries of the workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent was consistent with the extent of trust and responsibility conferred on Soh. Accordingly there was no reason to overturn the judge`s finding of fact in the present case.
In any event, even if the judge was wrong in finding that Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s consent, I was of the view that Soh would still be guilty of the charge if he had in fact employed Zhou, even though he had no general authority to hire workers.
 (1)WHETHER SOH EMPLOYED ZHOU ON THE FACTS OF THE PRESENT CASE
Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) (`the Act`) reads: 
 
 
(1) Any person who - 
 
(e) employs any person who has acted in contravention of section 6 (1), 15 or 36 or the regulations; 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and - 
 
(ii) subject to section (1A), in the case of an offence under paragraph (b), (d) or (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000.
  
 
 
`Employ` is defined in s 2 as: 
 
""employ"" means to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without remuneration.
 
 
 
This definition came into effect on 1 March 1996.
As I noted in 
Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 702
 , under the amended definition of `employ`, in s 2 of the Act, there was no longer a requirement that the prosecution must prove the existence of a contract of service or any payment before the alleged employer could be charged under s 57(1)(e) of the Act. In 
PP v Heng Siak Kwang
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 274
  it was held that the manner of remuneration and control over the workers would often be of great significance in deciding whether there was an employment relationship between the parties. 
 Heng Siak Kwang 
 dealt with the definition of `employ` before the amendment in 1996. Nevertheless the manner of remuneration and the degree of control of the workers continue to be two significant considerations in determining the existence of an employment relationship: 
Ramli bin Daud v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 225
 ; 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 ; 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
. However, these are not the only considerations which the court will take cognizance of when determining the existence of an employment relationship.
In the present case, there was evidence that Soh had control over Zhou. In the long statement, Soh stated as follows: 
 
A few days later,
 the male China national (Zhou) contacted me and asked me if there is any job for him. I told him that there is and asked him to come for work
 ...
 On his arrival, I demonstrated to him how to do the work. I also told him that he could come for work one or two days later
 ... After two days, the male China national (Zhou) came to the company. 
 I then gave the address of a unit and told him to go there to do the cleaning works in a taxi
. I also told him that the keys to the unit would be above the meter reading box. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In court, Soh admitted that he had made the above statement. However, Soh sought to qualify his statement by saying that Zhou called Ting in the office, and not him, and that Ting told him to inform Zhou that there was a job for Zhou and to ask him to come to work. When Soh was asked during cross-examination to explain why he had omitted to mention that it was Ting who had instructed him to ask Zhou to come to work, he claimed that he was very tense when he was in the police station.
The judge rejected Soh`s qualification, as it was never once mentioned in his long statement. She held that it was implausible for him not to mention that he had done everything on Ting`s instructions because he was very tense, since he was able to give a very detailed account of how he had met Zhou and dealt with him, and had even mentioned Ting`s name. It was also held that it was inconceivable that he could have omitted such a material fact, namely, that it was Ting and not him, who had employed Zhou, if that was indeed the case.
On appeal, defence counsel submitted that the judge was wrong in accepting Ting`s testimony that she never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou. It was also contended that the judge had erred in fact when she disbelieved Soh`s testimony at trial that all the instructions given to Zhou were upon Ting`s orders. Counsel contended that Soh`s omission to mention in his long statement that he had been acting on Ting`s instructions as regards Zhou ought not to be taken against him, as direct and specific questions such as `Who employed Zhou?` or `Did you employ Zhou? If not, who did?` were not posed to him. Counsel also submitted that Soh was very tense when the statement was taken and it was not unusual for an accused person to omit to mention certain important facts in view of the pressures faced during police investigations.
I was unable to accept this argument. As rightly held by the judge, if Ting had in fact given instructions in asking Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to come to work, it was very unlikely that Soh would omit to mention that fact, given that he had mentioned Ting earlier in the statement and given that this was an important fact. There was no need to pose specific questions to elicit this fact if Ting had indeed been involved. In my view, the judge`s finding that Ting never gave permission to employ Zhou should be upheld. I was also satisfied that the judge was not wrong in rejecting Soh`s qualification to his long statement at trial.
Apart from Soh having control over Zhou, there was other evidence which gave rise to the inference that Zhou was employed by Soh. Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day two to three times and had given Zhou a handphone registered under Soh`s name so that it would be convenient for Soh to contact him (Zhou) if there was any work. The phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address. Soh claimed that Home Shape had instructed him to purchase the handphone and that the bills were paid by Home Shape. However, no evidence was adduced to show that this was so. If the phone was indeed purchased for Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would leave the billing address as his residential address for one and a half years and not subsequently change the billing address to that of the company. Furthermore, if the bills were to be paid by Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would be so unconcerned with whether unpaid portions of certain bills or amounts that were overdue had been paid by Home Shape. It would be in his interest to see that the bills were paid since he would be personally liable if payments were not made.
Accordingly, I was satisfied that the element of employment had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 (2) MENS REA
The offence under s 57(1)(e) is not one of strict liability. The prosecution had the burden of establishing that Soh had the necessary mens rea, that is, he knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that Zhou was an immigration offender: 
Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP

In my view, Soh had the requisite mens rea for the offence. From the evidence, Soh had gotten to know Zhou at a nearby canteen and he was aware that Zhou was a China national. There was no evidence that Soh had checked Zhou`s passport or work permit. Soh had not exercised any due diligence on Zhou`s immigration status.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh argued that the sentence of one year imposed by the court below was manifestly excessive for the following reasons: Soh had completely no part to play in Zhou`s illegal entry into Singapore; there could not have been any profit motive on the part of Soh as he was not the boss of the business; there was no evidence to suggest that Soh stood to gain or had gained any advantage in having employed Zhou; Zhou was employed only on an ad hoc basis; Soh did not give any assistance to Zhou to evade apprehension; only one immigration offender was involved; there was no ill-treatment of the person employed; Soh has no antecedents whatsoever whether of similar offences or otherwise.
Counsel for Soh also submitted that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused, the court ought to take into consideration the following mitigating factors: Soh was married with three children (ages 16, 14 and 12 years) and his wife was a housewife who was currently four months` pregnant. He had set up his own business and was holding the post of production manager. He was drawing a gross monthly salary of $5,000. Since late 1992, Soh had been diagnosed with and had been treated for chronic anxiety-depressive disorder.
In the recent case of 
 Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about two months. He was a first offender and was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. The accused unsuccessfully appealed against conviction and sentence. His sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment on appeal. In 
 Tan Soon Meng v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about six months. The accused, who had three previous convictions for illegal employment under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. He initially appealed against his conviction, but subsequently applied to withdraw his appeal. Before the court acceded to his application, his sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment.
 Tan Soon Meng 
 was affirmed in 
 Ang Jwee Herng v PP 
 (supra) in which the court reiterated that the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrant workers was now one year, double that of the previously assumed tariff of six months.
In my view, the imposition of a minimum term of six months` imprisonment as prescribed by s 57(1)(ii) of the Act was confined to cases where the accused pleaded guilty to the charge. In cases where the accused was convicted after trial, the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrants was one year`s imprisonment.
The impact of imprisonment on the offender`s family members is generally not relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out. In
 Ang Jwee Herng 
 (supra), I held at [para ]78 that: 
 
... the argument that an offender`s family members will suffer if the offender is incarcerated for a longer term is one often put forth in vain by defence counsel. The reason, as I explained in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  is simply because imprisonment of the sole breadwinner inevitably causes hardship to the family. If the courts were to take such hardship into account in determining the appropriate sentence, then any punishment meted out would not be accurately reflective of the gravity of the offence and circumstance of the offender himself, but tempered with considerations of the extent to which his family would be prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay for committing a crime is the hardship that would unavoidably be caused to the offender`s family. To put it bluntly, the appellant should have thought hard about these consequences before committing the offences in question. It is now too late in the day for him to regret the inescapable hardship which his own foolishness and greed will cause to his wife and children.
 
 
 
Accordingly, I did not think that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the sentence ordered by the district court should be affirmed.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons stated above, I denied the criminal motion and dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: On 3 March 2009 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Central Local Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: Possess a prohibited pistol not being authorised to do so by a licence or permit, contrary to s 7(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment. A standard non parole period of three years is applicable. 
       
       
      Count 2: Possess a firearm which was not registered, contrary to s 36(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 10 years imprisonment. There is no standard non parole period applicable to this offence. 
       
       
      He was then committed to the District Court for sentence. 
       
      
    3 On 19 June 2009 the applicant was sentenced for those offences in the District Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: A non parole period of four years six months imprisonment commencing on 24 June 2009 and expiring on 23 December 2013 with a balance of term of one year six months commencing on 24 December 2013 and expiring on 23 June 2015. 
       
       
      Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment of two years eight months commencing on 24 June 2009 and expiring on 23 February 2012. 
       
      
    4 The sentence on count 1 took into account the following offences on a Form 1: 
     
      
       
      (1) Possession of ammunition without a licence contrary to s 65(3) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996.  
       
       
      (2) Possession of a prohibited drug, 0.27 g methylamphetamine, contrary to s 10(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985.  
       
      
    5 The applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentences on the grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ1. His Honour erred in commencing the sentences on 24 June 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in failing to consider the question of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in failing to make a finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentencing judge erred by not allowing a discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty before committal in accordance with s 17(1)(a) of the  
        Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 
        .â€ 
        
       
      
    6 The facts were agreed. In essence, at approximately 3.00 am on 10 June 2008 two police officers stopped in response to traffic lights at an intersection. They observed a Subaru WRX which was also stopped in response to traffic lights at the intersection. There were four male occupants in the vehicle. The actions of the driver and passengers aroused the interest of the police who pulled the vehicle over a short distance from the lights. As his Honour recounted: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œInformation regarding the WRX and its occupants was then broadcast over police radio and Officer Oâ€™Brien reached into the car to remove the keys from the ignition. 
        
       
       
        
        Officer Oâ€™Brien noticed all four [occupants] become extremely nervous, looking from side to side and behind them as they fidgeted and reached down between their legs with their hands. He then stepped back from the vehicle and pulled the restraining clip from his firearm, yelling â€˜Keep your hands up where I can see them, stop moving around and keep your hands up. If you donâ€™t someone is going to get hurt.â€™â€  
        
       
      
    7 A search of the vehicle and its occupants revealed the presence of a balaclava and three white gloves. One occupant (Nguyen) had a machete with a 50 cm blade secreted in his pants. A black Parabellum pistol containing a magazine with 10 live rounds of ammunition was located in the foot well where one occupant (Chompeay) had been sitting. A 32 calibre Beretta pistol was located in the foot well area on the driverâ€™s side where the applicant had been sitting. It contained a magazine with two live rounds of ammunition. A plastic bag containing 0.27 grams of methylamphetamine was located in his pocket. The occupant Tran had a Taser-type device, in working order, on his person and a copper coloured bullet in his pocket. A .25 calibre pistol with a magazine with six live rounds was found in the foot well area where Tran had been sitting. The pistols were prohibited and unregistered. The occupants had no licences or permits in respect of them. Numerous items of correspondence in the name of the applicant were located in the glovebox of the vehicle. 
     
      
    8 All four occupants of the vehicle were arrested. Subsequently Nguyen was deported before charges were laid against him. The applicant and the other two occupants were sentenced together.  
     
      
    9 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour, the sentencing judge, allowed a 20 percent discount for the guilty pleas. Regrettably, his Honourâ€™s attention was not drawn to the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 which had application in this case and provided: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ17(1) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time before being committed for sentence, the sentencing court must allow a discount for the guilty plea calculated as follows:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a termâ€”a term that is 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposedâ€ 
        
       
      
    10 The Crown conceded that a material error had occurred in this regard. In the circumstances the sentences must be quashed and the applicant resentenced. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was born in October 1976 in Vietnam. He gave evidence on sentence that he and his family escaped as boat people from Vietnam to Malaysia where they spent time in a refugee camp. In 1982 they migrated to Australia. At age 14 he left school and was recruited into a criminal gang and adopted a life of crime. 
     
      
    12 The applicant has a wife and two young children. At the time of his arrest he was unemployed and had been for six months. In the past he had had problems with gambling and drug use. 
     
      
    13 He was examined by a psychologist, Professor Woods, who assessed him as suffering from substance abuse disorder, severe personality disturbance with paranoid features, residual symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and pathological gambling. He had seen the applicant in late 2004 and early 2005 and had commenced therapy which, he said, resulted in the applicant making excellent progress. Treatment ceased during incarceration and the applicant reported his symptoms were returning. 
     
      
    14 Professor Woodsâ€™ opinion was based largely upon a history given to him by the applicant. As the applicant was not a credible witness (see para [18] hereof), little weight can be attached to Professor Woods opinion as to the applicantâ€™s mental state. 
     
      
    15 I have had regard in resentencing the applicant to his affidavit affirmed on 7 May 2010 in which he states he is participating in a printing traineeship, has enrolled for rehabilitation courses, is receiving treatment for his drug problems, has family support, and is determined that this will be his last time in gaol. It is to be hoped that the applicant is now on a path that will lead to his rehabilitation but the evidence is not sufficient to consider the applicantâ€™s prospects in this regard as other than equivocal. 
     
      
    16 The applicantâ€™s record showed that he had been convicted of a number of types of different offences including illegal use of a motor vehicle, self administer prohibited drug, break enter and steal, armed robbery, steal motor vehicle, possess firearm without licence, resist officer, enter inclosed lands, behave in an offensive manner, supply prohibited drug, possess unauthorised firearm, possess prohibited drug and goods in custody. He has served previous terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 At the time of the offence the applicant was on conditional liberty, being on parole, having been sentenced to four years imprisonment with a 15 month non parole period for drug supply, and a concurrent ten month fixed term for possession of an unauthorised firearm, with the sentences commencing on 25 June 2005. He was released to parole on 24 September 2006. As a result of the subject offences, the parole was revoked effective as of the date of his arrest, 10 June 2008, and he was ordered to serve the balance of parole of one year 15 days, which expired on 24 June 2009. 
     
      
    18 The applicant informed Professor Woods and gave evidence that he was in the process of purchasing a gun for self protection from the 5T gang, of which he had been a member. He said he and the other occupants of the vehicle had obtained the guns on credit a few hours earlier and that when stopped by the police they were on their way to borrow the funds to pay for the weapons. There is no evidence to confirm this explanation (apart from the evidence of the co-offender Mr Chompeay). The circumstances make it improbable, and I do not accept it. I am confirmed in my conclusion by the comments of the sentencing judge who had the benefit of observing the applicant give evidence on sentence and who described the applicantâ€™s oral evidence as â€œtrite, fanciful, unbelievable and contrary to common senseâ€. He totally rejected that evidence, observing that, even if it was true, it did not mitigate the seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    19 The Firearms Act 1996 s 7(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œA person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit.â€ 
        
       
      
    20 A prohibited firearm is defined in s 4 and means a firearm described in Sch 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. The firearms there described ranged from a machine gun, rifle, shotgun down to replica firearms. A prohibited pistol is defined in s 4C(1). 
     
      
    21 Section 7(1) refers to both possessing and using a firearm. It can be argued that using is a more serious offence than possessing and that a pistol is less dangerous than a machine gun. However, each can be lethal and a pistol may be readily concealed upon the person. Much depends upon the circumstances. 
     
      
    22 In this case the pistol was loaded and unsecured. It was in the applicantâ€™s possession when he was a member of a group of heavily armed young men. The pistol was within a vehicle upon a public street in an urban area. It was capable of being concealed upon the applicantâ€™s person or in the vehicle. A balaclava and gloves were in the vehicle. The pistol represented a high risk to members of the public and to the arresting police though it was not used on this occasion. There was no acceptable innocent explanation for the possession of the pistol which in any way mitigated the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    23 The objective circumstances of this offence, in my opinion, place it significantly above the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences. In these circumstances, reference to the yardstick provided by the standard non parole period is of limited assistance. The maximum penalty of 14 years thus becomes the principal factor in determining the sentence as the objective criminality is above the mid range â€“ R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 at [37] and Micklesson v R [2009] NSWCCA 61 at [15]-[16]. 
     
      
    24 The offences were committed by the applicant in circumstances where punishment, including imprisonment for a previous similar offence, had had no rehabilitative effect upon him and the offences were committed in breach of parole. A lengthy custodial sentence is warranted for specific deterrence and protection of the community. 
     
      
    25 I have had regard to ss 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No penalty other than full time imprisonment is appropriate and no submission to the contrary was made.  
     
      
    26 The applicant is entitled to a 25 percent discount for the pleas of guilty. The subjective factors are of little assistance to the applicant. There is no acceptable evidence of remorse or contrition and I have already commented on rehabilitation. The applicantâ€™s record is not one which entitles him to any leniency from the Court. 
     
      
    27 The doctrine of totality requires the Court to consider â€œthe total criminality involved not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentenceâ€ and to ensure that the aggregation of sentences is a â€œjust and appropriate measure of the total criminality involvedâ€ â€“ Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 per McHugh J at 307-308, R v Kerr [2008] NSWCCA 201 at [26]. At the time of sentence the applicant was completing a period of imprisonment following the revocation of an earlier parole. He had only a few days remaining of that sentence. The applicant was serving the earlier sentence for a serious offence of supplying the commercial quantity of heroin. The sentence for the possession of the prohibited firearm had expired well before his arrest on the subject charges. The drug offence was a serious matter and distinct from the subject offences. I do not regard it as a special circumstance which would justify reduction of the non parole period. In my opinion, there were no special circumstances. 
     
      
    28 Judicial Commission statistics and a table of cases were before the Court. However, the statistics were based upon a small number of cases. They were too limited to provide guidance as to the appropriate range particularly when dealing with an offence where the circumstances may be so variable. Similarly, I did not find the table of cases of any real assistance. 
     
      
    29 I have taken into account on count 1 the two matters on the Form 1.  
     
      
    30 In my opinion, the appropriate sentence (rounded off) on the count 1 offence is imprisonment for a non parole period of three years eleven months with a balance of term of one year four months. The penalty that would have been imposed on count 1 but for the guilty plea was seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    31 The second count relates to the same pistol. In my opinion, the appropriate sentence for this offence is a fixed term of imprisonment for two years two months, to be served concurrently with the sentence under count 1. 
     
      
    32 The sentences for counts 1 and 2 should commence on 19 June 2009, being the day on which the sentences were imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant as follows: count 1 imprisonment for a non parole period of three years eleven months to commence on 19 June 2009 and expire on 18 May 2013 and a balance of term of one year four months to expire on 18 September 2014; count 2 imprisonment for a fixed term of two years two months to commence on 19 June 2009 and expire on 18 August 2011. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 18 May 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 20 October 2008, the applicant was found guilty by a jury of 9 counts of obtain a financial advantage by deception (the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), s 134.2(1)); 6 counts of attempt to obtain a financial advantage by deception (the Criminal Code Act, ss 11.1 and 134.2(1)); and 1 count of deal with proceeds of crime (count 17 of the indictment) being $100,000 or more (the Criminal Code Act, s 400.4(1)). 
     
      
    2 All offences except count 17 related to the lodging of business activity statements with the Australian Taxation Office which claimed false Goods and Services Tax refunds. Count 17 related to using the proceeds of the funds obtained as a result of the first 9 counts. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 134.2(1) is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 400.4(1) is 20 years imprisonment or 1,200 penalty units ($132,000), or both. 
     
      
    5 On 1 May 2009, Ainsley-Wallace DCJ sentenced the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2012.  
     
      
    6 The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in determining that general deterrence was a factor in determining the sentence or alternatively gave undue weight to the principles of general deterrence; 
       
       
      Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances; 
       
       
      Ground 3: the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence for count 17 that was not wholly concurrent with counts 1 to 15.  
       
      
    7 At the commencement of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, counsel for the applicant informed the Court that grounds 1 and 2 were abandoned.  
     
      
    8 The Crown had already indicated in its written submissions dated 28 June 2010, that it conceded ground 3. The Crown accepted that this would involve a reduction in both the total sentence and the non-parole period. The Crown also accepted that in any re-sentence exercise, it was appropriate for the Court to maintain the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period as had been ordered by the trial judge. 
     
      
    9 The Court considered that the Crown had properly conceded ground 3 and that the sentence on count 17 should be quashed and the appellant re-sentenced in respect of that count so that it ended on the same date as the last sentence otherwise imposed by her Honour. The non-parole period correspondingly needed adjustment. Accordingly, the Court made orders at the conclusion of the appeal to that effect. Those orders are formalised below.  
     
      
    10 Notwithstanding that ground 3 was conceded by the Crown, it is appropriate that we say something about it.  
     
      
    11 Count 17 charged the applicant with a money laundering offence which arose out of the same facts as the other offences with which she was charged. There have been at least three cases before the Court in the last year where the Court has criticised the prosecution practice of charging offenders in this way. To the credit of the Crown Prosecutor in this case, he brought those cases to our attention and made the concession to which we have referred.  
     
      
    12 The problem was adverted to in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294, when Howie J pointed out that money laundering offences were intended by the legislature to be directed at activity where persons were intimately involved in dealing in money that was the result of some other personâ€™s criminal activity, so as to hide its source.  
     
      
    13 Shortly after Thorn, this Court delivered its decision in Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58. In that case, the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six offences contrary to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the decoder offences) concerning the sale of, or offering to sell, unauthorised decoders. The relevant provisions of that Act were ss 135ASB(1) and 135ASC(1). The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to the Criminal Code Act, s 400.6(1). That section is concerned with dealing in the proceeds of crime. The decoder offences each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The offence of dealing in the proceeds of crime carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The applicant, on a plea of guilty, was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years, to be served by way of periodic detention, on the copyright offences. Relevantly for present purposes, however, on the money laundering offence, he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    14 The Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Rothman JJ) referred first to Thorn and noted, at [14], that there was a basis in that case for the money laundering charge: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œâ€¦ because it captured criminality of the applicantâ€™s co-offender, who had never been charged and yet was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant.â€ 
        
       
      
    15 The Court then stated, importantly, at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œWe appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.â€ 
        
       
      
    16 Those remarks apply in this case to count 17. However, it is important to re-emphasise this Courtâ€™s disapproval of such prosecutorial action. The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that he has brought this issue to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. We note that the charges in this case were laid and the trial conducted and sentences passed well before the decisions to which we have referred were given. Nonetheless, the matter is of such importance that we consider a copy of these remarks should be brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    17 We confirm the orders of the Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentence imposed with respect to count 17 and, by way of re-sentence, impose a sentence of 2 years imprisonment to start on 20 October 2012 and conclude on 19 October 2014; 
       
       
      4. Quash the non-parole period specified by the sentencing judge and set a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months to conclude on 19 March 2012.

      2007/2278 REGINA v MELAYNA SUZETTE ROBERTS 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    HER HONOUR: 
     
      
       
      The trial proceedings 
       
      
    1 On 12 September 2007, Ms Melayna Suzette Roberts appeared before me for trial. On 1 June 2007, with the consent of the Crown, the trial was set down without a jury pursuant to the provisions of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. When arraigned Ms Roberts entered a plea of not guilty to the murder of Damon Mark Roberts at Gosford on 21 August 2006 on the grounds of mental illness. Damon Roberts was the biological child of Ms Roberts and her estranged husband Mr Rodney Roberts. He was five years of age at the time of his death. The cause of death was certified to be the combined effects of drowning and asphyxia. 
     
      
    2 By her own admission, made formally pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995, Ms Roberts acknowledges that her son died on 21 August 2006, that his death was the result of her unlawful act and that her acts were accompanied with an intention to kill. Having regard to the evidence tendered before me I am satisfied that the relevant unlawful act was constituted by Ms Roberts holding her son under water in the bath at the home of her estranged husband and, that in so doing, she intended to kill him. The sole issue in the trial before me was whether Ms Roberts should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 or convicted of his manslaughter on the basis that her capacity was substantially impaired in accordance with s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900.3 No oral evidence was called in the proceedings by either the Crown or the accused. By consent and without objection their respective cases were the subject of documentary tender. 
     
      
    4 Given the nature of the proceedings the critical documents were the reports of the forensic psychiatrists. They comprised the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 13 March 2007 and 6 September 2007, which were commissioned and tendered by the Crown, the reports of Dr Westmore, dated 29 August 2006 and 4 August 2007, which were commissioned and tendered by the accused and the reports of Dr Rosalie Wilcox, dated 15 April 2007 and 9 September 2007, also tendered by the accused. 5 The three doctors independently came to the view that at the time of Damonâ€™s death, Ms Roberts was suffering from a recurrent major depressive illness. This is a recognised mental illness both in clinical practice and in the diagnostic literature. Each of the doctors regarded the illness from which she suffered to be of such severity as to ground either the defence of mental illness under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act by reason of it being a disease of the mind or a finding of substantial impairment on the basis of it being an abnormality of mind for the purposes of s 23A of the Crimes Act. None of the doctors were prepared to be definitive, or even to speak in terms of probability, in favouring one finding over the other. I am however assisted by Dr Westmoreâ€™s views to the effect that from a psychiatric perspective the difference between the psychiatric defence under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and a finding of substantial impairment under the Crimes Act is reflected in the degree of severity of the illness, together with the way in which the illness impacted on the accusedâ€™s behaviour, or was otherwise affecting the accused in the particular circumstances in which the crime was committed. That approach necessarily requires a careful analysis of the accusedâ€™s reported thoughts, feelings and impressions leading up to the commission of the offence which may, by definition, be either reliable or unreliable, together with an analysis of the objective or other forensic evidence that may operate either to corroborate or contradict the accusedâ€™s account. 6 Each of the three reporting doctors interviewed Ms Roberts. Dr Westmore spoke with her at length on 26 August 2006 at Mulawa prison. In January 2007 she was released to bail. Thereafter she was under Dr Wilcoxâ€™s care at the Sydney Private Clinic, a private psychiatric hospital where Ms Roberts was receiving treatment. Throughout her admission, until her discharge in April 2007, Dr Wilcox saw her twice a week. In February 2007, Dr Neilssen attended on her at the Sydney Private Clinic for the purposes of reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Each of the doctors were provided with various materials extracted from the prosecution brief of evidence in order to prepare their reports, although I note that since Dr Westmore saw her five days after Damonâ€™s death he had access only to the police facts sheet and the statement of Mr Rodney Roberts. Dr Westmore was also provided with a letter from Dr Charters, Ms Robertsâ€™ general practitioner, who detailed his various treatments for her recurrent depression in 2003 and 2004. Dr Nielssen was also provided with documents relating to Ms Robertsâ€™ transfer from prison to hospital pursuant to s 97 of the Mental Health Act 1990, and with various other medical records relating to her treatment for mental illness in the past. While these documents were not the subject of a separate tender, they are referred to by Dr Nielssen and are of some relevance in revealing a history of depression from which Ms Roberts has suffered for some years.  
     
      
    7 After considering the materials tendered before me at trial, I expressed the tentative view, particularly having regard to the unanimity of opinions expressed by doctors Westmore, Nielssen and Wilcox, that the special verdict of not guilty to murder as provided for under s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act was open. The Crown did not seek to persuade me that I should come to any other verdict.  
     
      
       
      The verdict 
       
      
    8 Accordingly, I was satisfied that on the day of her sonâ€™s death and by reason of mental illness, Ms Robertsâ€™ capacity to think rationally was temporarily suspended, depriving her of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of her behaviour. Her defective reasoning enabled her to form a belief that to achieve release from the pain and grief she was experiencing it was a reasonable course of action for her to take her own life and, since she could not consider her son living without her, that it was also right that she take his life as well. I am also satisfied that her mental illness compromised her capacity to see her son as a person in his own right. 
     
      
    9 On 12 September 2007, the day of her acquittal and without dissent from the Crown, Ms Roberts was released pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act subject to various conditions that were agreed upon by the Crown and Ms Robertsâ€™ legal representatives. I ordered that the conditions apply strictly until further order or variation by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
     
      
    10 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a quasi-judicial specialist body currently established under the Mental Health Act 1990. I note that this Act will soon be replaced by the Mental Health Act 2007. The new Act does not appear to significantly affect the functions and powers of the Tribunal with respect to the conduct of hearings in which the Tribunal is empowered to review cases of patients who have been found not guilty of a criminal offence by reason of mental illness. The Tribunal is charged with the statutory task of seeking to achieve a balance between several sets of often competing rights such as, the individualâ€™s right to liberty, safety and freedom from unnecessary intervention, the individualâ€™s right to treatment, protection and care, and the interests and rights of the community to safety and protection. In ordering Ms Robertsâ€™ release I expressed every confidence that Ms Roberts would continue to faithfully submit to the care and supervision of her doctors and to comply with any directions or suggestions of the Tribunal as they review her progress from time to time. I accepted then, and do so unreservedly today, that Ms Roberts poses no threat to the community, including any child, and that with the insight she has gained into her actions she poses no threat to herself. 
     
      
       
      The reasons for the verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness 
       
      
    11 After entering the verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, I indicated that I would publish reasons in support of that finding. The balance of this judgment constitutes those reasons. 
     
      
    12 The materials provided to the reporting doctors, materials that were separately tendered before me, included a statement from Mr Rodney Roberts. I have been greatly assisted by Mr Robertsâ€™ detailed account of his observations of his former wife in the weeks leading up to Damonâ€™s death including, importantly, his observations of Ms Roberts and the various telephone conversations he had with her before he arrived home at 4:45 pm on 21 August 2006 to find his son and Ms Roberts fully clothed in the bath. I am satisfied that by the time he arrived home his son was deceased but perhaps only by some minutes. After removing his son from the bath Mr Roberts placed a call to â€œ000â€. I have considered the text of that call. Mr Roberts reported that his son was neither conscious nor breathing and that he thought his former wife had drowned their son and had attempted to take her own life. At approximately 5:00 pm police and ambulance officers arrived.  
     
      
    13 The statements of the attending police were also tendered in the proceedings. They are of relevance as they set out the conversations they had with Ms Roberts upon their arrival at Mr Robertsâ€™ home and their observations of her attitude and demeanour after she was taken into custody. 
     
      
    14 A paediatric autopsy report prepared by Dr Kevin Patrick and dated 14 December 2006 was tendered together with an expert certificate from Dr William Allender, a forensic scientist in medicinal chemistry. In so far as Dr Patrickâ€™s report is concerned, his examination of the deceased child revealed no external injuries that were in his view inconsistent with having been sustained during the course of resuscitation. That said, given that Ms Roberts told police that she held her son under the water and that she told Mr Roberts that the child struggled to an extent, I am satisfied that despite the fact that the boy was found beneath the water cradled in his motherâ€™s arms, that the bruising on his upper arms is consistent with Ms Roberts applying some force to his upper body to ensure that he remained submerged beneath the water. My view is reinforced by the fact that the toxicology report was negative for drugs save for very low levels of Promethazine (an anti-histamine medication), which in Dr Patrickâ€™s view would not have been productive of any adverse effects. 
     
      
    15 Mr Roberts supplied police with a note addressed to him from Ms Roberts that had been left with other belongings of hers on the stairs leading to the bathroom in his home. Police found another note addressed to â€œDearest Heavenly Fatherâ€ at Ms Robertsâ€™ residence. The content of both notes are consistent with being written before Damon was drowned and reflect Ms Robertsâ€™ intention to take her own life and that of her child. Her intentions were repeated to both her former husband and investigating police after the death of her son. Otherwise, the content of the notes revealed little about whether she was suffering from a mental illness of such severity as to attract the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, or whether her mental capacity was compromised such as to reduce her culpability for murder to that of manslaughter. On the other hand, in my opinion her religious beliefs, enmeshed with her illness, appear to have encouraged her to think that by taking her life and that of her son they would together find a greater peace and ultimately their resurrection. It is not for me to pass any comment on her religious convictions and I do not. I am simply recording the fact that her desire for peace and a permanent refuge from her pain and grief was imposed upon her son and, that in so doing, she deprived him of his life. I am satisfied that her inability to see her son as a separate psychological and physical entity was a manifestation of her illness. This is reflected in the views of each of the psychiatrists. 
     
      
       
      Past psychiatric history  
       
      
    16 Ms Roberts was first treated by a mental health professional in 1994 after she was a victim of a sexual assault. Her next contact followed Damonâ€™s birth in 2001, at that time in the context of marital tensions and the fact that Damon suffered illness as a small child. She reported three or four depressive episodes after that time, on each occasion in the context of her recurrently troubled marriage. She was treated with anti-depressant and/or anti-psychotic medication on these occasions. She resumed anti-depressant medication on 18 August 2006, three days before Damonâ€™s death. I shall refer to the significance of this later in the judgment. 
     
      
    17 In October 2004, Ms Robertsâ€™ marriage was again under considerable stress although both Mr and Ms Roberts reconciled at that time largely, it would seem, in the interests of their young son. Within six months of that reconciliation the marriage again faltered.  
     
      
    18 On 21 August 2005, after a number of failed attempts, Ms Robertsâ€™ mother committed suicide. Whether her motherâ€™s suicide was the catalyst for her marriage ultimately breaking down is not entirely clear. What is apparent, however, is that the death of Ms Robertsâ€™ mother was a trigger event for the fresh onset of her daughterâ€™s depression and other manifestations of grief. Ms Roberts saw her mother as the person who she described as her primary support person. In the weeks following her motherâ€™s death the marriage between Mr and Ms Roberts finally ended although they continued to work together in the family business and share the parenting of Damon.  
     
      
    19 Between Easter and June 2006, Ms Roberts made concerted efforts to address her fragile emotional state and her debilitated physical state. It was during this three-month period that, with assistance, she managed to wean herself off anti-depressive medication. However, in June 2006 she suffered a fresh onset of symptoms of depression in the form of disturbed sleep, appetite loss, fluctuating energy levels and social withdrawal. She told Dr Westmore that at this time she managed to get through each day but with increasing difficulty as the anniversary of her motherâ€™s death approached. She saw this event as a â€œbig hurdleâ€ she had to get over. I am satisfied that in an effort to try to cope with her grief and her emotional pain at the loss of her marriage in circumstances where she was also feeling an increasing distance from her immediate family, and with the anniversary of her motherâ€™s death approaching, she again sought psychiatric assistance. She saw Dr Bartholemusz for grief counselling on three occasions in the six weeks before Damonâ€™s death.  
     
      
    20 On Friday, 18 August 2006, her general practitioner prescribed the anti-depressants Lexapro and Xanax (a medication to treat anxiety and depression). Her doctor advised that it would be a matter of days to a week before the medication took effect and, for this reason, she was encouraged to contact her former husband and ask for his assistance and support by making himself available to her and their son in the days leading up to the anniversary of her motherâ€™s death and on that particular day. She asked him to come and stay with her but in the result agreed that she and Damon would stay with Mr Roberts in accommodation he rented in Gosford.21 Mr Roberts reported that Ms Roberts was emotionally drained and in a variable mood when in his company and that on both the evening of Friday 18 August and Saturday 19 August she took sleeping tablets to assist her to sleep. He said they spoke at length about her grief and Ms Roberts â€œbeing a lost soulâ€.  
     
      
    22 On Monday, 21 August, the first anniversary of the death of Ms Robertsâ€™ mother, Mr Roberts understood that she was due to attend the cemetery with her father and sisters during the morning. He had agreed to take a half-day off to be with her to support her upon her return from the cemetery. Ms Robertsâ€™ father participated in a lengthy recorded interview on 29 August 2006 where he detailed, amongst other matters, his observations of his daughter during the family gathering at the cemetery. He said that his daughter said that she felt very drained and flat. On the other hand, he said there was nothing in her demeanour or behaviour that gave any indication that she was considering taking her own life or her sonâ€™s life. He did say, however, that she refused the invitation to join with her family for lunch preferring, she said, to go home and await the arrival of her former husband. When Dr Westmore asked her whether she was upset at the cemetery, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œIn a different way to now. I was just numb. The last 12 months have been numb and surreal. I have gotten through day to day stuff with Damon, I havenâ€™t taken on extra stuff. Every day was hard. It has just been survival at the end of each day.â€ 
        
       
       
      She told Dr Wilcox that upon leaving her father and sister after praying at her motherâ€™s grave she went back to her house feeling â€œsad, heavy, overwhelmedâ€.  
       
      
    23 Mr Roberts spoke to Ms Roberts just before 3:00 pm to inform her that he was waiting on an email before he could leave his place of work and meet her at his home. She told him that she was at the Gosford waterfront with Damon, kicking the soccer ball. When referring to the 3:00 pm telephone call, Mr Roberts described her as sounding flat, discouraged and generally in a depressed state. Ms Roberts informed Dr Wilcox that as she was leaving the waterfront she remembered thinking that she and Damon would have a rest, and that whilst the drive home was surreal, she was able to recall a number of discrete actions on her part. In particular, she recalled going to her home to collect her sonâ€™s comfort blanket and, whilst there, writing the letter addressed to â€œDear Godâ€ referred to earlier. She then said that she drove to Mr Robertsâ€™ home and that it was upon arrival there, and she thinks sometime before she spoke to her husband by telephone at 4:00 pm, that she decided she could not go on with her life.  
     
      
    24 She said that it was during this time that she took four Xanax tablets on the basis that because she missed her morning dose and had been prescribed two tablets twice a day that she would take the morning and evening dose at the same time. She said that at this time she also gave her son 7.5 ml of a Phenergan type medication. She claimed that the medication was not given to sedate her son but because he had been bitten by an ant at the park and that he was allergic to ants. Whilst this may well be the case, I note that the medication Promethazine identified in Damonâ€™s blood on autopsy also has the potential to produce some drowsiness. This may go some further distance in explaining how she was able to persuade her son to join her in the bath fully clothed and to effectively subdue what must have been his natural resistance to being submerged in the bath water to the point of asphyxiation. 
     
      
    25 She said that after her son was playing for a time at his fatherâ€™s home they held one another and said a prayer before she told him that they were going to have a bath together. She said that while she ran the bath she resumed praying with Damon and told him that they were going to go to sleep and that they would wake up with Mimi (the childâ€™s grandmother and her mother) who was with Jesus. She said that she stepped into the bath with the child in her arms and that they laid down together with the child cuddling into her with his blanket. She said that he turned a couple of times to get breath but eventually surrendered.26 When Mr Roberts arrived home at 4:45 pm, he was unable to find his former wife and child. He thought they must have returned to the waterfront. In the process of checking whether his sonâ€™s bike was in the laundry he noticed the note that she had left him on the stairs. The note read:  
     
      
       
        
        â€œDearest Rod, Please know that GOD LOVES YOU and so do we. I just wish it was different. Love always Melayna and Damon.â€ 
        
       
      
    27 He then heard water splashing and thought that his former wife and his child had decided to take a bath and that the splashing water was his sonâ€™s way of letting him know where he was. He then walked into the bathroom and saw his wife lying on her left side facing the wall whilst his son was lying on his right side facing her. He said there wasnâ€™t a lot of water on the floor, that Damonâ€™s head was under the water and she had both her arms wrapped around him. When he pulled his deceased child from the bath he noticed that Ms Robertsâ€™ face was red and that she was sobbing. 
     
      
    28 She reported to Dr Wilcox that if her husband had not arrived she would have taken her own life. She also acknowledged that it would have been difficult for her to drown herself in the bath and that she had no other means at hand to effect her suicide. She was also unable to explain why she had taken her medication if it was her intention to suicide. 
     
      
    29 In this connection Dr Allender was firmly of the view that the dose of 4 mg of Xanax, a short-acting anti-depressant medication, was not excessive notwithstanding the fact that she had taken in effect a double dose. In Dr Wilcoxâ€™s view, the fact that she took her medication at all at this time is a further indication of the extent of her disassociation given that very soon after taking the drugs she drowned her son and had the expressed intention of then taking her own life.30 The child was removed from Mr Robertsâ€™ home by ambulance officers and Ms Roberts was taken into custody. Whilst in police custody Constable Joanne Plummer spoke with Ms Roberts at about 7:00 pm. She observed her to be rational and articulate in her conversation although softly spoken and subdued. She was asked how she was feeling and said words to the following effect:  
     
      
       
        
        â€œIt wasnâ€™t meant to be like this. I was meant to go too. I couldnâ€™t bear knowing he would live his life without a mother. I know what its like, itâ€™s a year today my mother passed away. Children shouldnâ€™t have to live without their mothers, its too sadâ€¦ I went to visit mum today at Palmdale, it shouldnâ€™t be like this. I was meant to go too, just off to sleep.â€ 
        
       
      
    31 The events leading up to the death of Damon Roberts, including Ms Robertsâ€™ particular vulnerability to the onset of a major depressive illness, resulted in the tragic loss of a young life â€“ the more so because it was at the hands of his mother. I have no doubt that she has felt and will continue to feel her own personal sense of responsibility for her actions and that she is deeply remorseful for the pain she has caused Damonâ€™s father. That said, it is appropriate that I emphasise that Ms Roberts has been acquitted of any criminal responsibility for his death by reason of her mental illness.

Queen v. Kuzmack, [1955] S.C.R. 292

Date: 1955-03-07

Her Majesty The Queen Appellant;

and

Michael Kuzmack Respondent.

1955: January 28, 31, February 1; 1955: March 7.

Present: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey,
Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA

Criminal lawâ€”Murderâ€”Defence of accident or
self-defenceâ€”No charge to jury as to manslaughterâ€”Whether there was material to
call for charge with respect to manslaughterâ€”Criminal CodeÂ , s. 259Â  (a), (b).

The respondent was convicted of the murder of a woman. He and
the deceased were alone in a house when the occurrence took place. His defence
was accident or self-defence in a struggle over a knife said by the respondent
to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart from his evidence, there was
nothing to show the particulars of what took place. There was evidence that the
respondent and the deceased had agreed upon marriage and that there had been
prior dissension between them over the mode of life led by the deceased.
Shortly before the fatal act, they were heard quarrelling.

The trial judge did not charge the jury as to manslaughter.
The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial and the Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Locke J. dissenting): that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey,
Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The circumstances were sufficient to call
for the trial judge to charge the jury with respect to manslaughter. If the
jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide was culpable, it was
necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent the respondent had
inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that he possessed the
intent required by s. 259Â  (a) or (b) of the Criminal
CodeÂ , the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the jury
should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

Per Locke J. (dissenting): There was no material before
the jury to justify a direction that they should consider a possible verdict of
manslaughter.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta 1[1],
quashing, O'Connor C.J.A. and Cairns J.A. dissenting, the respondent's conviction
on a charge of murder and ordering a new trial.

[Page 293]

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Tasehereau, Rand, Kellock,
Estey, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by:â€”

The Chief Justice: The
Attorney General of Alberta appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court 2Â directing
a new trial where the accused was charged with and convicted of the murder of a
woman. The substantial point is whether there was evidence sufficient to call
for an instruction to the jury that they might find manslaughter.

The deceased and the accused were alone in a house when the
occurrence took place. The defence was accident or self-defence in a struggle
over a knife said by the accused to have been in the hand of the victim. Apart
from his evidence, there is nothing to show the particulars of what took place.
Two witnesses, the occupant of the house and his wife, then a short distance
away from the house, heard a scream and saw the woman come staggering out. To
the wife she cried ""get me to a hosp â€¦"" and then she collapsed.

There was evidence that the accused and the deceased had
agreed upon marriage and that there had been prior dissension between them over
the mode of life being led by the deceased. That morning, shortly before the
fatal act, they were heard quarrelling. At some stage a knife came into play
which pierced the woman's neck to cut the jugular vein and she died in a few
minutes from loss of blood.

These, and other circumstances unnecessary to mention, were
sufficient to call for the learned trial judge to charge the jury with respect
to manslaughter. In Mancini's case 3, Viscount Simon, after referring to the rule
laid down in Woolmington's case 4,
that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable doubt,
and consequently that if on the material before the jury, there is a reasonable
doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it, pointed out that this is a
rule of general application in all charges under criminal law. His Lordship
continued at p. 279:

Thus, when a prisoner is charged with murder and felonious
homicide is proved against him, if the jury, when considering the evidence as a
whole at the conclusion of the case, are left in reasonable doubt as to whether
the homicide proved is not manslaughter, they should return a verdict of
manslaughter.

[Page 294]

If the jury concluded upon the evidence that the homicide
was culpable, it was necessary for them to decide as a fact, with what intent
the accused had inflicted the fatal wound. If they had a reasonable doubt that
he possessed the intent requisite under 259(a) or (b) of
the Code the prisoner must be given the benefit of that doubt, and the
jury should then consider the offence of manslaughter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Locke J.
(dissenting):â€”My consideration of the proceedings in this matter leads me to
the same conclusion as that expressed at the trial by the learned Chief Justice
of the Trial Division and in the Appellate Division by the learned Chief
Justice of Alberta 5.

As there is to be a new trial, I make no further reference
to the evidence other than to say that, in my opinion, there was no material
before the jury which would justify a direction that they should consider a
possible verdict of manslaughter.

I would allow this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONDUTY JUDGE LISTBRERETON JMonday, 29 October 20073359/07 White City Tennis Club Ltd v John Alexanderâ€™s Clubs Pty Ltd & 2 ors 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: For many years the land and improvements known as White City at Rushcutters Bay, owned by the New South Wales Tennis Association (""Tennis NSW""), has been the home of tennis in New South Wales. The plaintiff White City Tennis Club Ltd (""the Club"") has operated a tennis club at White City, most recently under a lease for a term of 25 years from 1 October 1995 of the whole of the first floor and part of the ground floor of the building under the Northern Stand. On or about 10 January 2004, Tennis NSW granted the Club an option to purchase part of White City for $5.8 million, exercisable by 30 September 2004 and subject to development approval. In February 2004, the first defendant John Alexander's Clubs Pty Limited (""JACS"") made a proposal to the Club intended to enable the Club to continue its traditional activities while securing its future through joining with JACS in a redevelopment of White City. A revised proposal, which would have involved the Club assigning the benefit of the option to JACS, on the basis that JACS would (1) exercise the option for the benefit of a new club in which A class shares would be acquired by foundation members of the Club and B class shares by other members of the Club and members of the public, and (2) construct a new five-star tennis and health club facility, ensuring that members of the Club could continue to enjoy the benefits of the redeveloped club, was accepted by the Club on 16 June 2004. However, the conditions of the option were not satisfied, and it lapsed on 30 September 2004.  
     
      
    2 Subsequently, Tennis NSW resolved to offer White City for sale by tender. On 28 February 2005, the Club and JACS entered into a written Memorandum of Understanding relating to the proposed purchase and redevelopment of White City. The MOU recited that JACS was negotiating with a third party â€“ since identified as the trustees of the Sydney Grammar School (â€œGrammarâ€) â€“ with a view to entering into an agreement with the third party that would include terms whereby the third party and JACS would prepare and lodge a tender for the purchase by the third party of White City from Tennis NSW, and the third party would grant JACS, on behalf of White City Holdings Ltd (a company to be incorporated to establish and operate a new club at the redeveloped White City, the A class shares which would be available for purchase only by persons who were members of the Club), an option to purchase part of the land from the third party [Clauses 1.8, 5.2]. The parties acknowledged that it was fundamental that those members of the Club who became members of the new club â€“ called Foundation Members â€“ would obtain certain minimum benefits and entitlements from the implementation of the project [Clause 3.5].3 The MOU envisaged that JACS would exercise the option, if at all, not for its own benefit but on behalf of White City Holdings, and that if it did not exercise the option on behalf of White City Holdings, there would be an alternative mechanism by which the Club could acquire the land if JACS on behalf of the Club did not do so [Clause 3.7]: 
     
      
       
        
        3.7 JACS agrees that it will seek to obtain an option to purchase the Land or part of it from TNSW or the third party and in the event it obtains the option from TNSW or the third party referred to in Clause 1.8 herein or any right to purchase the Land or any part of it then: 
         
         
        3.7.1 in the event that JACS exercises the option from TNSW or the third party that it will exercise the option on behalf of the WCH, upon WCH simultaneously granting to JAWCC [a company to be incorporated and to be the principal operating company for the project] a 99 year lease of the land entering into the operating agreement referred to in Clause 6.1(e) herein; 
        
       
       
        
        3.7.2 JACS will seek to procure in favour of WCTC a further option to purchase the Land or part of it exercisable by WCTC within 90 days of expiry of the Option Period in the event that JACS is unable to or fails to exercise the option from TNSW or the third party in accordance with its terms; 
        
       
       
        
        3.7.3 in the event that JACS is unable to procure the further option referred to in Clause 3.7.2 herein and JACS has not exercised the option from TNSW or the third party 30 days prior to the expiration of the Option Period, then upon WCTC giving written notice to JACS that WCTC requires JACS to exercise the option on behalf of WCTC, that JACS will proceed to exercise the option from TNSW or the third party on behalf of WCTC. 
        
       
      
     4 Following an invitation to submit tenders, Grammar (in the agreement called SGS), the third defendant Sydney Maccabi Tennis Club Ltd (""Maccabi""), JACS and the Club (called WCTC) on 29 June 2005 entered into an agreement (""the White City Agreement"") that provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        2. The parties agree that use of the Land be allocated between the parties as set out and further detailed in this agreement and the attached plans, being briefly that: 
         
         
        a. SGS will develop and use the area north of the stormwater channel for additional playing fields and parking and will have access to that parking from the Alma Street entrance.  
         
         
        b. Maccabi will use its area south of the stormwater channel for 8 tennis courts, a club house and parking.  
         
        
        
        c. WCTC will be lessee and WCTC and JACS will use the whole of the land (other than the parking area north of the stormwater channel) to undertake (in accordance with their agreement dated 18 June 2005) until 30 June 2006 the operations currently carried on by WCTC.  
         
         
        d. After 1 July 2006, SGS will construct its new playing fields north of the stormwater channel and until 30 September 2007 WCTC and JACS will continue (in accordance with their agreement dated 18 June 2005) the operations currently carried on by WCTC on the area south of the stormwater channel.  
         
         
        e. JACS has an option at any time before 30 June 2007 to acquire from the SGS the area south of the stormwater channel, other than the area allocated to Maccabi, without affecting SGS's access to its car park north of the stormwater channel. If JACS exercises this option it will construct new sporting facilities, gymnasium and club house on that part of the land. If JACS does not exercise its option, WCTC has an option to acquire the land between 1 July and 30 September 2007, 
         
         
        f. If neither JACS nor WCTC exercises the option, the land south of the stormwater channel other than the Maccabi Land will remain under SGS's ownership. 
         
         
        3. Each party will do all things necessary and desirable to give effect to their own and each others' intentions and that each party will co-operate fully with the others with the aim of giving effect to and fully supporting those intentions. 
         
         
        Land Allocation 
          
         
         
        4. On completion of the purchase of the Land ( 
        'Settlement'),  
        subject to survey, the entitlements in respect of the Land as between the parties will be as set out in the attached plans, briefly described below, in these percentages: Maccabi 15%; Option Land 50.2%; and SGS Land 34.8%, allocated as specifically set out in this agreement.  
         
          
         
        5. The  
        'Maccabi Land' 
         comprises: 
         
         
        a. 8 synthetic grass tennis courts, with minimum size of 115ft x 54ft, plus a one metre walkway on the southern, western and northern boundaries ( 
        'Maccabi Courts' 
        ). These tennis courts will be on the south eastern portion of the Land, roughly where the 6 synthetic courts are currently and in due course including part of the land where the eastern stand is currently situated, 
         
         
        b. 30 car parking spaces for its members, and other users of the Maccabi Courts, and subject to availability, additional spaces will be made available on an agreed commercial basis. All of these spaces will be in the car park south of the storm water channel, either in the existing car park constructed south of the stormwater channel or in the new car park constructed by JACS or WCTC, 
         
         
        c. a 300m2 clubhouse including changing facilities ( 
        'Maccabi Clubhouse' 
        ), as further described in paragraphs 10 and 11 below, and 
         
         
        d. access between the car park, the Maccabi Courts and Maccabi Clubhouse, including the areas marked on the diagram in orange as 'Maccabi occupancy'.  
         
         
        6. If Maccabi wishes to do any work on the Maccabi Courts during its 2 year lease of the Maccabi Courts to WCTC, it will not start that work in the 1 January 2007. WCTC will allow Maccabi possession and access for this purpose from that date. 
         
        
       
      
    5 Despite references in the White City Agreement to an attached diagram, none was attached. However, an understanding of the layout of the land is aided by the plan attached to this judgment. 
     
      
    6 Clause 7 of the White City Agreement defined â€œthe SGS Landâ€ as comprising the area north of the stormwater channel, and the land (called ""the Option Land"") south of the stormwater channel other than the Maccabi land, unless JACS or the Club exercised the option, granted in Clause 8, to buy the Option Land, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        8. Subject to Settlement, SGS and Maccabi ( 
        'Grantors' 
        ) grant the following rights, referred to as the  
        'Option' 
        : 
         
         
        a. to JACS an option to acquire the Option Land for the Option Amount payable solely by JACS, exercisable by JACS giving written notice to the Grantors and paying the Option Amount at any time from completion of the purchase of the Land until 30 June 2007, but 
         
         
        b. if JACS does not exercise the option within this period, the Grantors grant WCTC an Option from 1 July to 30 September 2007, exercisable by WCTC giving written notice to the Grantors and paying the Option Amount before 30 September 2007. 
        
       
       
      
    7 It is uncontentious that the option contained in Clause 8a is an option of the type contemplated by Clause 3.7.1 of the MOU, and that contained in Clause 8b is one of the type contemplated by Clause 3.7.2 of the MOU. 8 By Clause 9, the Option Amount was $6.33 million (subject to certain adjustments), and the party that exercised the Option became ""the Option Land Owner"". By Clause 10b, if either JACS or the Club exercised the Option, and the land had not then been subdivided, the Option Land Owner would own 50.2% of the land as tenant-in-common with Grammar (34.8%) and Maccabi (15%), or if the land had been subdivided to create a separate title for the SGS Land (north of the stormwater drain), but the Maccabi Land and the Option Land (south of the stormwater drain) was still on one title, then the Option Land Owner and Maccabi would own, as tenants-in-common, 77% and 23% respectively of the combined area of the Option Land and the Maccabi Land.  
     
      
    9 Clause 10c provided:  
     
      
       
        
        c. The Option Land Owner will, subject to funding and development approval: 
         
         
         1. construct and maintain on the Option Land at its cost, a club including tennis courts and sports and recreational facilities, plus a car park for at least 300 cars, and 
         
         
         2. construct the Maccabi Clubhouse at reasonable cost, currently circa $800-$1000 per m2 (to be borne by Maccabi who will also be responsible for and bear the fit out cost), either as a separate facility or as part of the Option Land Owner's facilities, in a position convenient to the Maccabi Courts. 
        
       
      
    10 Clause 11 provided that in the event that neither JACS nor the Club exercised the option, the Maccabi Clubhouse would be located under the eastern centre court stand, or in any other location agreed between Grammar and Maccabi, but Grammar would be under no obligation to demolish the eastern stand and Maccabi would bear any cost of fit out, demolition and reconstruction. Clauses 12 and following were relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        12. Maccabi will have unfettered access to and ownership of the Maccabi Clubhouse to the fullest extent possible at law and a 99 year lease at a peppercorn rent if required by Maccabi (unless it is recognised as part of the Maccabi Land in any subdivision). Unless and until exercise of the Option, no party may begin work on the Option Land without SGS's prior written consent. 
         
         
        Maccabi Clubhouse and Courts 
         
         
        13. From expiry of the Lease of the Maccabi Courts, the Maccabi Clubhouse will be under the eastern stand unless and until demolished by the Option Land Owner and may be shared between Maccabi and the Option Land Owner.  
         
         
        14. From the date of the demolition, the Option Land Owner will grant Maccabi full use of equivalent facilities until the Maccabi Clubhouse is completed. If, within 18 months after the eastern stand is demolished Maccabi has not been provided with a permanent Maccabi Clubhouse, Maccabi will be allocated at least 300m2 of land adjoining and convenient to the Maccabi Courts for its sole use on which to build the Maccabi Clubhouse at its cost, marked on the attached plan as 'Maccabi Default Occupancy Area'. Maccabi will continue to enjoy full use of other appropriate facilities until Maccabi has managed to complete building such facilities.  
         
         
        15. Given that it is proposed that Maccabi build two of the eight courts on land including the site of the eastern stand, from expiry of the Lease for as long as the eastern stand remains and for the period reasonably required to enable Maccabi to build its two additional courts on that land, Maccabi will have use of any two additional suitable courts on the Option Land and they will form part of the Maccabi Land. 
        
       
       
        
      
    11 Clauses 16 and following relevantly provide that Grammar and Maccabi as joint owners of the land will grant the Club a lease, commencing on the date of settlement, to be documented by an amended lease, of the whole of White City from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, and of the Option Land from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2007 unless and until JACS or the Club exercises the option; if JACS or the Club exercises the option then the Lease will expire on the date of exercise in respect of the SGS Land, and on 30 September 2007 in respect of the Maccabi land; and if neither exercises the option then on 30 September 2007. By Clause 21, the Club agreed to surrender any rights which it otherwise would have had in relation to White City under its former arrangements with Tennis NSW (in the agreement called TNSW), and that from 30 September 2007 Maccabi would have full and unfettered rights in respect of the Maccabi land. Clause 22 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        22. Each of the parties will have a stand alone, independent facility on its part of the Land with the exception of the Maccabi Clubhouse which will be built on the Option Land. Each party will bear all costs of maintaining in good repair the facilities on its Land and will bear all liabilities attaching to its Land, including work required by statutory notices. 
        
       
      
    12 By Clause 27, each party as occupant of a part of the land in accordance with the agreement agreed, in respect of that part of the land it occupied, that it did so at its own risk, and released the land owner from and indemnified the land owner in respect of any liability to the occupant in relation to that part. Clause 29 and following are relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        29. SGS and Maccabi will enter into an agreement under which SGS will sell Maccabi the Maccabi Land, for a purchase price of $3.3m. Maccabiâ€™s purchase of the Maccabi Land will complete contemporaneously with settlement ... . As a result Maccabi will own 15% of the land as tenant in common with SGS. SGS and Maccabi will, if required by either of them enter into a co-ownership deed reflecting more fully the matters referred to in this agreement.  
         
         
        ...  
         
         
        33. The parties intend to apply to subdivide the Land and will use best efforts to ensure that any application to subdivide the Land is successful and accurately reflects each party's entitlement as set out in this agreement and will collaborate with Woolahra [sic] Council in relation to the subdivision to maximize the benefit for all parties. Each party agrees to execute transfers and other documentation as required to resolve the parties' ownership of the Land in accordance with this agreement. ...  
         
         
        34. If the subdivision results in the area south of the stormwater channel being on a single title, so that the Maccabi Land and the Option Land remain on a single title, then SGS (or the Option Land Owner after exercise of the Option) and Maccabi will own the Land south of the stormwater channel as tenants in common as to 77% and 23% respectively. SGS (or the Option Land Owner if the subdivision occurs after exercise of the Option) and Maccabi will if required by either of them, enter into a co-ownership deed reflecting more fully the matters referred to in this deed. That deed will be assigned to the Option Land Owner on exercise of the Option, if it is entered into before exercise of the Option.  
         
         
        35. Until the subdivision is complete, no party may encumber any part of the Land, without approval of the other parties. Each party may lodge a caveat in respect of its interest in the Land, but must sign all documents necessary to give effect to the subdivision(s) and not rely on its caveat to affect the progress of the subdivision in any way.  
         
         
        36. If a party intends to sell its part of the Land ( 
        â€˜Selling Portionâ€™ 
        ), it must offer to sell the Selling Portion to each of the other parties subject to the terms of this Agreement (unless the Option has expired without being exercised, in which case the parties having the benefit of the Option do not have the benefit of this pre-emptive right ( 
        â€˜Offereeâ€™ 
        ) and must not sell the Selling Portion to any third person on any terms more favourable than those offered to the Offeree without first giving the Offeree 30 days in which to exercise its pre-emptive right to buy the Selling Portion on those terms. â€¦ 
         
         
        ...  
         
         
        41. This agreement binds the parties, their successors and assigns. ... 
         
         
        42. WCTC and JACS agree that their MOU dated 28 February 2005 and their agreement dated 18 June 2005 continue in accordance with their terms and each agrees to carry out its obligations under this agreement in accordance with those agreements.  
         
         
        43. To the extent of any inconsistency between this agreement and any other agreement between any of the parties, this agreement will prevail, unless specifically stated. â€¦  
         
         
        44. The parties must ensure that any successors and assigns become parties to this agreement by appropriate documentation. 
         
        
       
        
      
    13 Grammar completed the purchase of White City from Tennis NSW on about 1 July 2005, whereupon Maccabi completed the purchase of the Maccabi Land from Grammar. Grammar and Maccabi as lessors and the Club as lessee entered into a variation of lease dated 6 April 2006 to give effect to the surrender by the Club of its rights, as contemplated by Clause 21 of the White City Agreement, and the granting of an interim lease as contemplated by Clauses 16 â€“ 20 of the White City Agreement, the result of which was that the Club surrendered 13 years of its leasehold estate and its licence to manage and conduct tennis activities on White City.  
     
      
    14 Within one week of that surrender being formalised, JACS, on 12 April 2006, purported to terminate the MOU for alleged repudiation by the Club. The Club denies the alleged repudiation and disputes the validity of the purported termination. However, on 27 June 2007, JACSâ€™ nominee, the second defendant Poplar Holdings Pty Limited (â€œPoplarâ€), purported to exercise the Clause 8a option under the White City Agreement and to purchase the Option Land, on its own behalf. In late June 2007, the Club commenced these proceedings, in which it denies that it repudiated the MOU and disputes that the MOU has been validly terminated; and further alleges that the exercise of the option by JACSâ€™ nominee Poplar otherwise than on behalf of White City Holdings or the Club was in breach of fiduciary and /or contractual obligations owed by JACS to the Club, by reason of which it is said that Poplar holds the Option Land on trust for the Club. The Club seeks an order that JACS transfer the Option Land to the Club, upon the Club paying the option amount to Poplar. 15 White City has been subdivided into two lots â€“ one comprising the SGS Land north of the stormwater drain, and the other comprising the Maccabi Land and the Option Land south of the drain. Maccabi, Poplar and Grammar are now the registered proprietors as tenants in common of the two lots in the proportions 15:50.2:34.8 respectively. The issues 
     
      
    16 The clubhouse that the Club currently occupies under the northern centre court stand is situated on the Option Land. If the Club is, as it contends, entitled in equity to the Option Land, that would include its current clubhouse under the northern stand. Poplar contends the Club's lease of the Option Land terminated on 27 June 2007 upon exercise of the option, and that since then the Club has been holding over under the lease. 17 The Club, wishing to maintain its ability to operate a tennis club at White City pending the final determination of these proceedings, negotiated with Maccabi which, by a deed of licence dated 19 September 2007, granted to the Club a licence to use certain parts of the Maccabi land â€“ namely, the six existing Maccabi tennis courts, the interim Maccabi clubhouse under the eastern stand, and the two additional courts â€“ for a term of six months from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008.  
     
      
    18 On 26 September 2007, Poplar served notice to quit on the Club, requiring possession of the Option Land, including the clubhouse under the northern stand, by 31 October 2007. On 19 October 2007, Poplar's solicitor, by letter to the Clubâ€™s solicitors and without prejudice to the contention that the Maccabi Licence was not an effective grant of a licence to the Club, purported to revoke the licence. 19 The Club claims an interlocutory injunction restraining JACS and Poplar (1) from interfering with its enjoyment of its rights under the Maccabi Licence, and in particular its use of the interim Maccabi clubhouse under the eastern stand and the two additional courts; and alternatively (2) from interfering with its use and occupation of its existing clubhouse under the northern stand. The basis of the final relief in aid of which the first claimed injunction is sought is the restraint of an apprehended tort, namely interference with the Clubâ€™s contractual rights under the Maccabi licence. The basis of the final relief in aid of which the alternative claimed injunction is sought is restraint of interference with the Clubâ€™s claimed beneficial proprietary entitlement to the Option Land, on which the northern stand is situated; in effect it impugns Poplar's entitlement to give the notice to quit. 20 On an application such as the present for an interlocutory injunction, the test is whether the plaintiff has established a sufficiently seriously arguable case for a final injunction as to justify the grant of interlocutory relief, having regard to the balance of convenience. The two elements of ""seriously arguable case"" and ""balance of convenience"" are interrelated, in that the stronger the apparent case for final relief, the less will be required to tip the balance of convenience in favour of the grant of an injunction, and the disparity of convenience and inconvenience resulting from the grant or withholding of an injunction will affect how strong a case is required to justify an interlocutory injunction. However, where the decisive issue is a question of law, the Court should ordinarily endeavour, where it is possible to do so, to determine the question of law, rather than only to consider whether it is sufficiently arguable. Ultimately, the decisive issues in this application are such questions, and it is possible to determine them. The contractual claim â€“ the Maccabi Licence21 Poplar has written to Maccabi and the Club, asserting that Maccabi has no right to grant the licence, at least so far as it relates to the interim Maccabi clubhouse and the two additional courts, and has attempted to lock the Club out from the interim Maccabi clubhouse. It is not entirely clear whether Poplar objects to the licence in respect of the six existing Maccabi courts, Poplarâ€™s submissions on the application indicate that it does so object; but a letter dated 9 October 2007 from Gayle Meredith & Associates (for JACS) to Leslie Caplan and Grunstein (for Maccabi) indicates otherwise.22 The Club contends that these acts of Poplar constitute the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations. That tort is committed when the defendant (JACS and/or Poplar) intentionally interferes with the performance by a third party (Maccabi) of a contract (the Maccabi Licence) between that third party and the plaintiff (the Club). Direct persuasion or procurement or inducement of the other contracting party by the defendant is sufficient to constitute the tort [DC Thomson & Co Ltd v Deakin [1952] Ch 646, 681 (Evershed MR), 694 (Jenkins LJ)].  
     
      
    23 There is at least a reasonable apprehension that Poplar will, if not restrained, procure â€“ either by persuasion of Maccabi, or by itself effecting a lockout â€“ an interference with the Clubâ€™s enjoyment of the benefits purportedly conferred on it by the Maccabi Licence. JACS and Poplar did not contend otherwise. The gravamen of their case was that there was no valid contract: JACS and Poplar contend that Maccabi, as one of several tenants in common, was not entitled to grant a licence to the Club, and alternatively that if Maccabi could grant a licence, it could be revoked by any other of the tenants in common, and has been revoked by Poplar. Accordingly, the substantial issues are: 
     
     Â·  
     Was Maccabi entitled to grant the Maccabi Licence to the Club? 
      
       
      
     Â·  
     If so, was Poplar entitled to revoke the Maccabi Licence? 
    24 Was Maccabi entitled to grant the Maccabi Licence to the Club? Although there is authority elsewhere that one of several tenants-in-common may grant a licence which is not revocable by the others without the consent of the grantor [Chin Lan Hong v Cheung Poh Choo [2005] 3 HKLRD 811, [2005] HKEC 1156, [35] (HKCA)] (just as one of several tenants-in-common may grant a lease [see Catanzariti v Whitehouse (1981) 55 FLR 426; U-Needa Laundry Ltd v Hill [2000] 2 NZLR 308]), for the purposes of this Court, the right of one of several tenants in common of property to grant a licence was authoritatively determined in State of New South Wales v Koumdjiev (2005) 63 NSWLR 353, holding that a tenant in common of a property, although able to transfer or lease its interest to a stranger, cannot short of such transfer or lease grant a licence to a stranger which is irrevocable by other tenants in common if that licence is of a kind which goes beyond what is reasonable or incidental to the grantor's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, enjoyment in common with the other tenants in common, and which interferes with the possession and use and enjoyment of the property by other tenants in common (per Hodgson JA at [40]; Beazley JA and Hislop J concurring). Hodgson JA continued to explain: 
     
      
       
        
        41 For example, suppose there are two tenants in common of a small house, and one of them purports to grant a licence to twenty people to live in the house. If this amounted to excluding the other from possession, it would be a trespass; but if it fell short of excluding the other person, but was substantially detrimental to the other tenant in common's use and enjoyment of the property, in my opinion such a licence could be terminated by the other tenant in common, assuming that it went beyond what was reasonable and incidental to the grantor's possession and use and enjoyment of the property. That is, in my opinion, any licence in excess of the what is reasonable and incidental to one tenant in common's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, and which prejudices the other tenant in common's possession and use and enjoyment of the property, is a licence terminable by the other tenant in common. Otherwise, in my opinion, the",28/10/2007 0:00,NSW Supreme Court

Â 








Criminal law â€” Sentencing â€” Dangerous offenders and
longâ€‘term offenders â€” Accused declared to be dangerous offender and
sentenced to indeterminate prison term â€” Predicate offence occurringÂ  prior to
enactment in Criminal Code of longâ€‘term offender provisions â€” Whether
sentencing judgeâ€™s conclusion that longâ€‘term offender provisions not
available to person who satisfies dangerous offender criteria constituted error
of law â€” Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. Câ€‘46Â , ss.Â 753(1)Â , 753.1Â ,
759(3)Â (b) â€” Canadian Charter of Rights and FreedomsÂ , s.Â 11Â (i).

Â 

In February 2000, the accused was found to be a
dangerous offender and was sentenced to an indeterminate period of
imprisonment.Â  The predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment
in the Criminal CodeÂ  of the longâ€‘term offender provisions.Â 
The sentencing judge held that these provisions were not available to a person
who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria.Â  The Court of Appeal allowed the
accusedâ€™s appeal and ordered a new sentencing hearing.

Â 

Held:Â  The appeal
should be dismissed.

Â 

For the reasons set out in R. v. Johnson,
[2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, 2003 SCC 46, the sentencing judge was required to consider
the possibility of a longâ€‘term offender designation prior to declaring
the accused a dangerous offender, even though the predicate offence was
committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the longâ€‘term offender
provisions.Â  In the absence of a full inquiry into the suitability of a
longâ€‘term offender designation, it would be improper to reinstate the
sentencing judgeâ€™s finding that the accusedÂ  is properly classified as a
dangerous offender.

[2003] 2 S.C.R. 400, 2003 SCC 50, involves an appeal against a sentencing
judgeâ€™s decision to declare an offender dangerous and sentence him to an
indeterminate period of detention.Â  As in Johnson, Edgar and Mitchell,
the predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the
long-term offender provisions in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46Â .Â  The question that this appeal raises is whether the sentencing judgeâ€™s
conclusion that the long-term offender provisions are not available to a person
who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria constituted an error of law.

For the reasons set out in Johnson, the
sentencing judge was required to consider the possibility of a long-term
offender designation prior to declaring the offender dangerous, even though the
predicate offence was committed prior to the 1997 enactment of the long-term
offender provisions.Â  If an offender satisfies the criteria set out in the
long-term offender provisions and the sentencing judge is satisfied that a
determinate sentence followed by a long-term supervision order would reduce the
threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other
persons to an acceptable level, the sentencing judge cannot properly declare
the offender dangerous and thereupon impose an indeterminate sentence.

In this case, the record discloses insufficient
evidence to conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the
respondent would have been declared a long-term offender if the sentencing
judge had concluded that the long-term offender provisions were available.Â 
Having concluded that the long-term offender provisions are not available to a
person who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria, the sentencing judge did
not conduct a full inquiry into the suitability of a long-term offender
designation.Â  Absent such an inquiry, it would be improper to reinstate the
sentencing judgeâ€™s finding that the respondent is properly classified as a
dangerous offender.

accordance with the principles set out in Johnson.

The following written reasons for judgment were published:â€”



               Aug. 8
               Barwick C.J.
               
This applicant for special leave to appeal was convicted on indictment of armed robbery by the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Wallace J.) on 12th March 1976. He was represented by counsel in the proceedings in which he pleaded not guilty and which resulted in a verdict of guilty. On his conviction on that verdict, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven and a half years with a non parole period of four and a half years. By the time this Court delivered judgment on his application for special leave on 8th May 1979, he had served just over three years in prison and may possibly have become entitled to some remission of his sentence for good behaviour.
               
The ground upon which the applicant seeks special leave is that, in the proceedings upon his indictment, he was denied the benefit of a peremptory challenge duly made by him to a person called as a juror to try him. For that reason, he claims that he was not tried according to law and that the proceedings, the verdict and his conviction were void and his sentence unauthorized by law.
               
From his conviction the applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia upon grounds other than the ground now put forward for the grant of special leave. He was represented in that appeal by the same counsel as had appeared for him at his trial. His appeal was dismissed.
               
Subsequently, he presented to the Governor of Western Australia a petition for mercy upon the ground now taken on this application: see s. 21 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia (""the Code""). His petition was refused, it being said that his petition showed no ground warranting its grant.
               
Later, the applicant presented to the Governor a further petition upon the same ground but with the added ground of the discovery of fresh evidence bearing upon the issues arising in the proceedings. This petition was also rejected, it being said again that it showed no ground warranting its grant.
               
Undeterred by these setbacks, the applicant moved the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus directed to his gaoler upon the ground that, for the reason already expressed, the verdict and conviction were void and that the warrant of commitment issued upon his conviction constituted no justification for his imprisonment. The Supreme Court, correctly as I think, dismissed his motion, holding that the warrant did justify his imprisonment. The Court had no need to pass upon the regularity of the proceedings upon his indictment; and consequently did not do so.
               
Upon hearing his counsel in support of his application for special leave to appeal and counsel for the Crown in opposition thereto, the Court granted special leave to appeal, treated the argument before it as argument of the appeal, allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and ordered a trial upon the indictment. The Court indicated that the applicant was at liberty to apply to a judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia for bail and stated that it would in due course publish its reasons for making these orders.
               
The applicant, as I have indicated, pleaded not guilty upon his arraignment. Section 622 of the Code provides in such a case that the accused is ""by such plea, without any further form, deemed to have demanded that the issues raised by such plea  shall be tried by a jury and is entitled to have them tried accordingly"".
               
Section 626 of the Code provides:When an accused person has demanded to be tried by a jury, the proper officer of the Court is to inform him in open Court that the persons whose names are to be called are the jurors to be sworn for his trial, and is further to inform him that if he desires to challenge any of them he must do so before they are sworn.
               

               
Section 628, in providing for challenges to the qualifications of a juror or for cause, expressly preserves the right of peremptory challenge.
               
Section 30 of the Juries Act, 1957-1976 
                  W.A. provides for the inspection by the accused and his solicitor of a copy of the panel of jurors summoned for the relevant sitting of the court for criminal trials. This provision is not reflected in the relevant legislation of all the States, though it is in some.
               
The Juries Act provides for the exercise by an accused of peremptory challenge to the persons called as jurors at his trial:
                     

                        
38. 
                           

                              
(1) Without affecting the right of challenge to the array or for cause shown which might have been claimed or exercised immediately prior to the coming into operation of this Act, and without affecting the right of those prosecuting for the Crown to pray for an order to stand jurors aside to the extent authorised by subsection (2) of this section, any party at any criminal trial may challenge peremptorily eight jurors, except where two or more than two persons are charged with the same offence and are put on trial together in which case each of those persons may challenge peremptorily six jurors.

                              
                              
                              
(3) A right to challenge a juror must be exercised before the officer of the Court who is administering the oath, has begun to recite the words of the oath to the juror or where the juror reads the words of the oath from a card before the juror begins to recite those words, but not afterwards.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
                        
40. The law in the case of criminal trials respecting notice to an accused person of his right of challenge, and challenge to the array and to individual jurors for cause, and the ascertainment of facts as to challenge, and the swearing of the jury and informing them of the charge, and the discharge, death, or incapacity of a juror and the separation and confinement of the jury, and view by the jury, and special and general verdicts, and the discharge of the jury, is that which is set forth in The Criminal Code.

                        
                     

                  

               

               
Section 634 of the Code provides for representation of an accused by counsel:Every person charged with an offence is entitled to make his defence at his trial and to have the witnesses examined and cross-examined by his counsel.The term ""counsel"" includes any person entitled to audience as an advocate.
                  

               

               
The Court, on the argument of this application, was informed by counsel for the Crown that there is a long-standing practice in Western Australia for counsel to ""exercise the right of challenge"". I gather that a like practice exists in Queensland and, indeed, now in the United Kingdom. In some other States, the practice is for the accused personally to exercise the right of challenge assisted in at least one of those States, by leave of the trial judge, by counsel or instructing solicitor.
               
What happened in relation to the challenge of the jury in the proceedings upon the indictment of the applicant is beyond dispute. There is before us a portion of the transcript taken in the proceedings which evidences the empanelling of the jury. It is as well that I set out the relevant parts of that transcript. Mr. Cannon was counsel for the accused and Mr. Seaman, Crown Prosecutor:
                     
Clerk of Arraigns: Roger James McGregor Johns, the persons whose names you will now hear called are the jurors who are to decide between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and you upon your trial.If therefore you wish to challenge them or any of them, you must do so as they come to be sworn and before they are sworn and you shall be heard.
                     
Members of the jury, answer to your names and take the box as you are called.

Judith Anne Lowes, will you please stand and read the oath?
                     

                        
Juror Lowes: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Peter David Fraser.
                     

                        
Juror Fraser: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Therese Veronica Ryan.
                     

                        
Juror Ryan: I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the several issues joined between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence.
                     

                        
Clerk of Arraigns: Bernard Victor Ransom.
                  

               

               
Though not included in the portion of the transcript before this Court, the Court was informed, and it may be accepted, that after the arraignment of the accused, his counsel announced to the trial judge that he would exercise the right of challenge, a statement which apparently the trial judge accepted as a matter of course.
               
The applicant filed an affidavit in support of his application in which, apart from explaining the delay in making the present application, he said that he had not authorized the withdrawal of his challenge or acquiesced in the juror whom he challenged being sworn: and that, after he had challenged the juror, his counsel approached him where he stood in the dock and berated him for attempting to interfere in the conduct of the trial. The applicant in his affidavit said that, later, when addressing the jury, his counsel informed them that he followed the practice of never challenging a juror. There was no denial of the applicant's affidavit. I mention these facts for a purpose which will later appear.
               
Counsel for the Crown advanced an argument based upon what he claimed was the precise order of events in relation to the conversation by the counsel with the accused. In my opinion, this conversation probably took place after counsel had purported to withdraw the challenge to the juror and probably after the challenged juror had been sworn. But, in any case, and whenever it occurred, I would not for a moment accept the Crown's argument founded on what had taken place between counsel and the applicant, either that the accused then authorized, or acquiesced in, the withdrawal of the challenge.
               
In my opinion, the simple fact of the matter is that the applicant duly challenged the juror. The challenge must have been heard by the presiding judge. It is evident that the judge allowed that juror to be sworn only because of counsel's statement of the withdrawal of the challenge as recorded in the transcript. In the result, that juror was sworn and the applicant's challenge ignored. This must, in my opinion, in no small part have been due to what, as I shall point out, was a fundamental misconception of the authority of counsel. I cannot think that, but for the practice of which I have spoken and this misconception, a trial judge would not have given full effect to the accused's personal challenge. It could only be because the judge was diverted by that practice and the acceptance of the view that counsel could lawfully override the wishes of his client that the judge failed to realize the fundamental error of not giving effect to the challenge.
               
The right of challenge, and particularly the right of peremptory challenge, lies at the very root of the jury system as it now exists. That the challenge is peremptory means that the accused need not in any wise justify his challenge. It need represent no more than his personal objection to be tried by the person whom he sees before him and whose name he has heard. No doubt, in deciding whether or not to exercise the right of challenge, an accused may profit by the views of counsel. But, even so, he may prefer his own instinctive reaction to the person he sees to the experience or theories of the advocate. It is his peculiar right to follow his own impressions and inclinations.
               
When a prior view of the panel of jurors summoned for the sittings is allowed, some guidance in the exercise of the challenge may be gained from the knowledge of the names, addresses and occupations of those named on the panel. But, in my opinion, this advantage cannot displace the importance of a physical view of the jurors or be a reason to overbear the accused's reaction engendered by it.
               
For my part, it is of the utmost importance in the trial of accused persons that they not only have adequate opportunity to see and observe the jurors but that they are adequately informed of their personal right of challenge. I hold the view that the traditional admonition of the clerk of arraigns, statutory in Western Australia by virtue of s. 626 of the Code, does not sufficiently inform the accused of his rights, e.g. as to the extent of peremptory challenges and as to his right to challenge for cause. If the accused is represented by counsel it may be taken that counsel is not only himself aware of these rights but that he has apprised his client of them in due time to enable the accused effectively to exercise them. If the accused is unrepresented, the usual formula used by the clerk of arraigns should, in my opinion, be supplemented by the trial judge to ensure that the accused is fully aware of his right of challenge. Incidentally, the obligation to inform the accused of his right of challenge is, as I have said, statutory in Western Australia and not merely required as a matter of practice. It may therefore be doubtful if the decision in Reg. v. Berkeley
                  
    [19]
   is applicable in that State.



                         [1969] 2 Q.B. 446.


               
To return to the particular facts of this case, it is incontestable that the denial of the applicant's right of challenge vitiates the proceedings on the indictment. It is settled that if an accused's challenge is improperly disallowed or not given effect, the subsequent proceedings cannot yield a lawful conviction: they are said to be absolutely void: Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed., vol. 2, par. 260, e.g. R. v. Edmonds
                  
    [1]
  , per Abbott C.J., and R. v. Williams
                  
    [2]
  . Thus, there never has been a trial of the indictment in this case according to law. The conviction consequent on these proceedings must therefore be set aside.



                         (1821) 4 B. & Ald., at p. 473 [106 E.R., at pp. 1010-1011].

                         (1925) 19 Cr. App. R. 67.


               
It remains for me to deal with two matters: first, the need for safeguards when and where there is a practice under which counsel is allowed to exercise the accused's right of challenge, and secondly, whether where there has not been a trial according to law, the court, having regard to the terms of the Code, can quash the conviction and, in its discretion, direct a trial.
               
I have referred to s. 634 of the Code which gives the accused a right to counsel at his trial. It may be doubted, in my opinion, whether the expression ""to make his defence"" in that section is apt to include the exercise of the right of challenge to the jury. But, whatever the correct view of those words, the trial judge, in my opinion, can allow counsel who is authorized to do so to exercise for the accused his right of challenge. For reasons to which I will refer, I think it necessary for care to be take to ensure that the accused has given that authority and that the accused understands that the grant of this authority has not displaced his personal right of challenge.
               
In my opinion, a retainer or instruction to defend the accused does not automatically carry such an authority. It must, in my opinion, come specifically from the accused, either expressly or by clear implication; preferably, in my opinion, expressly. In my opinion, it is of the utmost importance that his delegation to counsel of his right of challenge should be specific and certain. In any case, that authority cannot be irrevocable or authorize the withdrawal of the accused's personal challenge when made, or be understood to displace the accused's ability personally to challenge.
               
If the profession understands that counsel needs such specific authority, counsel's statement to the trial judge that he is to challenge the jury may in general be accepted by the trial judge as an assertion by counsel that he has the accused's authority to exercise his right of challenge. Counsel could be expected to be scrupulous in this regard.
               
But, as I have said, the authority to counsel cannot be irrevocable. The accused clearly retains his right of personal challenge on the view of the jurors. Thus, in this case, assuming that his counsel had the accused's authority to challenge for him, the accused's personal challenge was none the less effective. Without further specific authority from the accused, counsel could not countermand or withdraw the challenge personally made by the accused.
               
When the practice of counsel exercising the right of challenge is allowed and the counsel's statement with its implication of specific authority is made and accepted, it would still be proper, in my opinion, for the presiding judge to ensure that the accused is given to understand that, notwithstanding the authority given to counsel, he retains the right personally to challenge. This should be done, in my opinion, just after the clerk of arraigns tells the accused that he must challenge the jurors as they come to the book to be swornâ€”a statement which incidentally is made to the accused even in places where the practice of allowing counsel to challenge obtains. The traditional formula is emphatic that it is the accused who has the right to challenge.
               
If the authority of the accused to challenge for him is accepted by counsel, it seems to me that counsel should be careful to defer to the wishes of the accused. In the instant case, counsel had his own view as to whether any challenge should be made: with him it was a matter of general policy not to challenge any juror. There may be some who would agree with this policy but, in my opinion, many, if not most, would doubt its wisdom. But, however that may be, adherence to such a policy would leave little or no room for the accused's own choice: and, after all, it is the accused who is in jeopardy, not his counsel or his counsel's reputation.
               
The possible division of the challenge between counsel and the accused has obvious dangers besides that which this case illustrates. For example, it could happen that counsel exercising the challenge may exhaust the limited right of peremptory challenge and the accused later wish to challenge a juror. There is much to be said for the practice of calling twelve persons to the jury box where they can be seen by the accused and thereafter an interval allowed between their placement there and the taking of any step to swear any of them. To ask the accused to challenge severally as each card is drawn and the juror comes forward may result in the exhaustion of the right before all intending jurors have been inspected.
               
Because of the dangers which I think attend the practice of counsel challenging, it is my opinion that the practice of allowing counsel or instructing solicitor to assist the accused in challenging is preferable. It is said that the practice of the challenge by counsel is desirable because an accused may be incapable for one reason or another of deciding on the challenge. But, if the accused is fit to plead (and s. 631 of the Code provides for the determination of that fact), the accused, in my opinion, is fit to challenge. After all, and with due respect to some of the theories advocates may have as to the choice of a jury, the expression of objection to be tried by a person standing before him or her must be one of the simplest things a person can be asked to do. If the accused lacks confidence in this task, the assistance, rather than the dominance, of counsel should provide the remedy. Permission to counsel to assist should, of course, be immediately forthcoming.
               
Then it is said that, by standing near the dock to assist the accused, counsel's dignity is compromised. I regret profoundly to differ. I do not believe it is in the least undignified, demeaning, or undesirable for counsel to be proximate or to be seen to be proximate to an accused when assisting him with the challenge. But I do think that a practice of the exchange of signals between bar table and accused in the course of the challenge lacks dignity and is far less acceptable than the presence of counsel near the dock when assisting the accused in the challenge.
               
There remains the question raised by counsel for the Crown, namely, whether s. 704 of the Code prevents the court ordering a venire de novo where there has been no trial, the court being confined to ordering a new trial consequent on finding a miscarriage of justice.
               
In my opinion, s. 704 of the Code has not produced this result. It was held in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions
                  
    [3]
   that the Court of Criminal Appeal could under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c. 23) (which contains a counterpart section to s. 704), direct the trial of an indictment where, because of fundamental defects in the proceedings, there had not been a trial according to law, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal under that Act, unlike in this respect the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Code, could not order a new trial upon a miscarriage of justice. It seems to me that the reasoning leading to this decision is applicable in Western Australia. Accordingly, in my opinion, the Court of Criminal Appeal can order the trial of an indictment when the proceedings thereon are held to be void.



                         [1921] 2 A.C. 299.


               
It has been held in England that, when setting aside a conviction because of a mistrial, the Court of Criminal Appeal is not bound to order a trial but may merely quash the conviction: see R. v. Gee
                  
    [4]
   and Reg. v. Gash
                  
    [5]
  . In my opinion, the decision and its reasoning warrant the conclusion that the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia is not bound to order a trial of an indictment where there has been none according to law.



                         [1936] 2 K.B. 442.

                         [1967] 1 W.L.R. 454; 
                         [1967] 1 All E.R. 811.


               
Accordingly, the Court considered in this case whether, having regard to the period already spent in gaol by the applicant and the circumstances of the case, a trial should be ordered. It concluded, none the less, that there should be a trial and ordered accordingly.
            


               
Gibbs J.
               
This was an application for enlargement of time within which to seek special leave to appeal, and for special leave to appeal, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia given on 12th March 1976 convicting the applicant of the offence of armed robbery and from an order of that Court made on 26th August 1976 sentencing him to a term of imprisonment for that offence.
               
This Court, after hearing argument, enlarged the time for making the application, granted special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia given on 2nd August 1976 dismissing an appeal from the conviction, treated the application as the hearing of the appeal, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction, and ordered a new trial. The Court announced that the reasons for taking this course would be given later.
               
At his trial, which commenced on 11th March 1976, the applicant was represented by counsel. We are toldâ€”although the transcript is silent on this matterâ€”that when counsel announced his appearance, he announced also that he would be exercising the applicant's right of challenge. The transcript records the applicant's plea of not guilty and the names of counsel representing the Crown and the applicant, and thereafter records the proceedings verbatim. The clerk of arraigns informed the applicant in the usual way that if he wished to challenge any of the jurors, whose names were about to be called, he must do so as they came to be sworn and before they were sworn. The clerk then commenced to call the jurors. Two jurors were called; no challenge was made, and the jurors entered the jury box. When the clerk called the name of the third juror, ""No. 22, Therese Veronica Ryan"", the applicant said, ""I challenge"". The transcript does not show what Therese Veronica Ryan did, but the clerk proceeded to call the name of another juror. According to the transcript, there was then an inaudible conversation between counsel, after which counsel for the applicant said, ""The last witness [sic] is not challenged, sir."" The learned trial judge then said: ""The last one; that is 22, Therese Veronica Ryan."" Counsel for the Crown replied, ""Yes sir"". Neither the judge nor counsel said anything further, and the clerk went on to call the names of other jurors. It may be inferred that Therese Veronica Ryan entered the jury box after the exchange between the judge and counsel had been concluded, because, after twelve jurors in all had entered the box, the oath was administered in turn to each of the twelve, including Therese Veronica Ryan. The trial then proceeded.
               
The applicant swore in an affidavit which was uncontradicted that a few minutes before he had been called upon to plead to the charge, and just before the learned trial judge had entered the court, he had been standing near the dock at the rear of the courtroom and had overheard a group of prospective jurors conversing. Because of what he heard and the general impression made upon him by the person later identified as Therese Veronica Ryan, he decided that he did not wish her to be a member of the jury, but before he could communicate with his counsel the learned trial judge entered the room and the proceedings commenced. He said that without any reference to him his counsel informed the judge that there was no challenge of Ryan, and again without reference to him the judge allowed Ryan to be sworn.
               
Before us, counsel for the Crown criticised some statements in the applicant's affidavit. The applicant said: ""Nothing was said by my counsel to the Court or me to indicate that he proposed to exercise any right of challenge on my behalf."" Counsel for the Crown pointed out that this statement could not be correct if, as appears to be admitted, counsel had announced his intention to exercise on behalf of the applicant his right of challenge. The applicant further swore: ""My conclusion that I had no personal right of challenge was reinforced shortly after Ryan was sworn when my counsel approached me in the dock in the presence of the jury thus sworn and whilst further jurors were being called rebuked me for ""interfering""."" Counsel for the Crown submitted that this statement also was inaccurate, since Therese Veronica Ryan was not sworn until all the other jurors had been called into the box. Notwithstanding these criticisms, it is not in doubt either that the applicant audibly stated in open court that he challenged the juror or that, as a result of the intervention by his counsel, and without reference to him, no effect was given to the challenge. Nor is it in contest that counsel for the applicant, in his address to the jury, commented on the fact that he had not challenged any juror and said that it was his policy and philosophy not to challenge.
               
After his conviction, the applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal on a number of grounds, but did not then raise the contention that the trial was defective by reason of the disallowance of the challenge to the juror. He sworeâ€”and again his evidence was uncontradictedâ€”that he was advised by counsel that this circumstance did not constitute a ground of appeal. On 2nd August 1976 the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, on 26th August 1976, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which he was still serving when the present application was made.
               
In September 1976 the applicant formed the opinion, as a result of something which he read in a book borrowed from the prison library, that in fact there had been a defect in his trial as a result of the disallowance of his challenge. He made various attempts to raise this matter for consideration. He twice petitioned His Excellency the Governorâ€”on 12th May 1977 and 31st January 1978â€”but neither petition was granted. In June 1978 he brought proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus but his application was dismissed. Finally, after an initial refusal, he obtained legal aid to make the present application. It should be added that during this time the applicant was asserting his innocence of the charge of which he was convicted.
               
By s. 38 (1) of the Juries Act, 1957 
                  W.A. as amended, it is provided, inter alia, that ""any party at any criminal trial may challenge peremptorily eight jurors"". Before Therese Veronica Ryan was called, no juror had been challenged by or on behalf of the applicant, and the applicant's right of peremptory challenge still remained available. It is clear that the applicant attempted to exercise that right. The traditional manner of indicating that a juror is challenged is to use the word ""challenge"", as the applicant did. However, on behalf of the Crown it was submitted that in the circumstances of the present case, where counsel had authority to conduct the proceedings on behalf of the applicant, the right of challenge could be exercised only by counsel and not by the applicant himself. It was pointed out that it has for very many years been accepted by the courts of Western Australia that counsel appearing for an accused person may exercise the r",8/8/1979 0:00,High Court of Australia

1The proceedings were commenced by summons in June 2012, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant, Dean Thomas Orchard, had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely, conspiring to supply a prohibited drug, heroin, contrary to s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for reasons there explained. 

2On 27 June 2012 I made restraining and other orders under s 10 and s 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), in respect of Mr Orchard's interests in certain property (see New South Wales Crime Commission v Orchard (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 June 2012, unreported).

3The parties now ask the Court to make a further order by consent, dismissing the application for a proceeds assessment order, Mr Orchard having warranted that his only interests in property as at the date of signing the orders were those specified in the schedule to the order.

4Having considered the terms of the order sought and the circumstances in which they are pursued, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 

5Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, with the result that the restraining order ceases to be in force and the proceedings are brought to an end.

(Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

Roland Coutu and

1943: May 25; 1943: June 29.

Present: Duff C.J. and Davis, Kerwin, Hudson

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Jury trialâ€”Practice and procedureâ€”Option
made after expiration of delayâ€”Consent of parties to extend delayâ€”Right to jury
trial forfeited and cannot be revivedâ€”Rule not one of mere procedureâ€”Conditions
prescribed for jury trial are imperativeâ€”Jurisdiction of jury extinguished
after expiration of delayâ€”Article 442 C.C.P.

The appellant brought an action against the
respondents for damages caused to him through the death of his son, killed by
the respondent company's truck driven by the other respondent, and made option
in his statement of claim for a trial by jury. On the 12th of December, 1941,
the trial resulted in a disagreement. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for
the appellant prepared a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the
second trial, and counsel for the respondents agreed in writing to the motion.
But, on the day fixed for the trial, objection was entered by counsel for the respondents
against the hearing of the case by a jury, on the ground that the consent given
by him was not valid. The trial judge overruled the objection, and, after
verdict by a jury, awarded $3,199.60 to the appellant. The appellate court
reversed this judgment on the sole ground that the appellant had forfeited his
right to a jury trial, and the record was sent back to the Superior Court for
trial before a judge without a jury.

Held that the
appeal to this Court should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin,
Hudson and Taschereau JJ. When both parties to an action have forfeited their
right to a jury trial through the expiration of the delay prescribe by article
442 C.C.P., either of them
cannot, even with the consent of the other, revive such right, no more than
they could give a valid consent to a jury trial when the law does not grant
right to it. The obligation, imposed by that article and drawn up in imperative
terms, is more than an ordinary rule of procedure prescribing a delay, which
rule the parties would at liberty follow or extend. The right to a jury trial
is subordinate to the conditions which are intimately connected with it. The
law has not only granted a right to the litigants, but it has also conferred
jurisdiction to twelve persons to hear the case and has imposed upon them the
obligation to perform their duties, when the request has been made to the court
within the prescribed delay. Consequently, when the delay has expired, a
conditional right has been lost because the condition has not been fulfilled;
and the jurisdiction of the jury has passed away and cannot be re-established,
even with the consent of the parties.

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the ; judgment of the
Superior Court, Savard J. and referring the case back to that Court for a new
trial.

The appellant, on the 9th of October, 1941,
brought an action against both respondents claiming damages for an amount of
$5,199.79 and making option for a trial by jury. On the 23rd of December, 1940,
the truck of the respondent company, driven by the respondent Coutu, had struck
and killed the appellant's son. A few days before the trial, the appellant
filed an incidental demand for seizure before judgment of the respondent company's
truck. A first trial before jury took place in December, 1941, but the jury
disagreed. Following the mistrial, it is contended by the appellant that
pourparlers of settlement had been in order within the thirty days' period
after the date of the first judgment; and both parties admitted that, on the
8th of January, 1942, a letter was written by the respondents' counsel offering
$500 in full settlement of the claim, which offer was refused on the 15th of
January, 1942. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for the appellant prepared
a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the trial; and counsel for
the respondents agreed in writing to the motion. But, on the day fixed, counsel
for the respondents objected to the trial and moved to strike the panel on the
ground that the consent given was not valid and that more than thirty days had
elapsed from the date of the first judgment to the date of the motion for a new
trial. The trial judge overruled the objection and ordered the parties to
proceed with the trial. The respondents were condemned, after verdict by a
jury, to pay to the appellant $3,199.79 for damages, and the incidental demand
respecting the seizure of the truck was also maintained. The appellate court,
without considering the other grounds of appeal, reversed that judgment,
holding that the appellant had lost his right to a jury trial by failing to
proceed within the delay prescribed by article 442 C.C.P.; consequently, the
verdict was quashed and the case was referred to the Superior Court to be heard
before a judge without jury. The appellant appealed to this Court.

le second appel des dÃ©fendeurs se rapportant Ã  la demande incidente, et a rendu
la mÃªme ordonnance.

C'est l'article 442 du Code de ProcÃ©dure Civile qui doit dÃ©terminer les droits respectifs
des parties; il se lit ainsi:

442. A dÃ©faut par la
partie qui a demandÃ© le procÃ¨s par jury de procÃ©der sur cette demande dans les
trente jours qui suivent celui oÃ¹ la cause est mÃ»re pour le procÃ¨s ou pour un
nouveau procÃ¨s, elle est de plein droit dÃ©chue de lÃ  facultÃ© de le faire; mais
le juge peut, sur demande faite dans l'intervalle, lui accorder un dÃ©lai
additionnel pour raison valable.

L'autre partie peut, dans les quinze jours
aprÃ¨s l'expiration de ce dÃ©lai, procÃ©der au procÃ¨s par jury.

A dÃ©faut de le faire dans aucun de ces cas, la
cause peut Ãªtre instruite pour enquÃªte et audition en la maniÃ¨re ordinaire.

L'appelant admet Ã©videmment que son application
pour un second procÃ¨s par jury Ã©tait tardive, car elle n'a Ã©tÃ© faite que le 7 fÃ©vrier 1942, quand le premier verdict avait Ã©tÃ© rendu le 12 dÃ©cembre 1941. Les dÃ©lais
Ã©taient clairement expirÃ©s, mais, l'appelant invoque un consentement signÃ© par
les parties Ã  ce qu'il soit procÃ©dÃ© Ã  la formation du rÃ´le des jurÃ©s le 11 fÃ©vrier 1942. Mais, il est bon de noter que, malgrÃ© le consentement donnÃ©, le
procureur des dÃ©fendeurs s'est objectÃ© Ã  la formation du rÃ´le, parce que les
dÃ©lais Ã©taient expirÃ©s et que le consentement Ã©tait invalide. C'est cette
prÃ©tention que la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenue, et elle en est venue Ã  la
conclusion que le dÃ©lai de trente jours est de rigueur, que les parties avaient
perdu leurs droits respectifs au procÃ¨s par jury, et que le consentement ne
pouvait les faire revivre.

Il est certain, et la Cour du Banc du Roi admet ce
principe, que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple question de procÃ©dure, les
tribunaux doivent donner effet aux consentements donnÃ©s par les parties. Mais,
la question qui se pose ici a-t-elle le mÃªme caractÃ¨re? Quand un droit
exceptionnel est donnÃ© Ã  condition qu'il soit exercÃ© dans un certain dÃ©lai,
peut-on faire revivre par consentement ce dÃ©lai expirÃ©? Car, il est
indiscutable que dans la province de QuÃ©bec, le cours normal de la procÃ©dure
est que tout procÃ¨s doit s'instruire devant un juge sans jury. C'est par
exception qu'en certains cas, dÃ©terminÃ©s par le code, il y a lieu au procÃ¨s par
jury. Mais, lorsque le demandeur dÃ©sire exercer ce droit restreint, il doit
procÃ©der sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui oÃ¹ la cause
est mÃ»re pour le

[Page 468]

procÃ¨s, et Ã  dÃ©faut de le faire, il est dÃ©chu
de son droit. Le dÃ©fendeur peut, dans les quinze jours qui suivent, faire la
mÃªme demande, mais il est lui aussi frappÃ© de la mÃªme dÃ©chÃ©ance s'il nÃ©glige
d'exercer ce privilÃ¨ge. MÃªme le juge ne peut accorder de prolongation quand les
dÃ©lais sont expirÃ©s.

Cette obligation, imposÃ©e par l'article 442 du C.P.C. et rÃ©digÃ©e dans des termes
impÃ©ratifs, me semble Ãªtre plus qu'une simple rÃ¨gle de procÃ©dure dÃ©terminant un
dÃ©lai que les parties peuvent respecter ou prolonger Ã  volontÃ©.

Le droit au procÃ¨s par jury est subordonnÃ© Ã  des
conditions qui y sont intimement liÃ©es, et qui pour ainsi dire en font partie.
On ne peut choisir un procÃ¨s par jury sans accepter toutes les obligations qui
en dÃ©coulent. Le code, en dÃ©crÃ©tant en quels cas il y aura lieu Ã  ce mode de
procÃ¨s, a non seulement accordÃ© un droit aux plaideurs, mais il a aussi confÃ©rÃ©
une juridiction Ã  douze hommes d'entendre ce litige, et leur a imposÃ©
l'obligation de servir, quand la demande est faite au tribunal dans les dÃ©lais
voulus.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a dÃ©cidÃ© que les deux
parties, dÃ©chues de leur droit, ne pouvaient faire revivre ce droit expirÃ©, pas
plus qu'elles ne pourraient donner un consentement valide Ã  un procÃ¨s par jury,
quand le code ne l'accorde pas. Un droit conditionnel a Ã©tÃ© perdu, faute de la
rÃ©alisation de la condition. La juridiction est maintenant disparue; et
celle-ci ne peut Ãªtre rÃ©tablie par un consentement.

Les tribunaux de la province de QuÃ©bec ont toujours
interprÃ©tÃ© sÃ©vÃ¨rement cette disposition de l'article 442
C.P.C, qui dÃ©termine dans quel dÃ©lai doit agir celui qui
veut conserver son droit au procÃ¨s par jury. Ainsi, en 1902,
Sir Alexandre Lacoste, parlant pour la Cour du Banc du
Roi, disait dans Canadian Pacific Railway v. Foster[1],

Le droit au procÃ¨s par jury est un droit
d'exception et il faut strictement se conformer aux exigences de la loi pour
pouvoir en rÃ©clamer le bÃ©nÃ©fice.

Le mÃªme principe a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©affirmÃ© en 1940 par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Consolidated Theatres Limited v. Nihon[2]:â€”

[Page 469]

La demande pour le choix et l'assignation du
jury et pour la fixation des dates doit Ãªtre faite dans les trente jours de la
dÃ©finition des faits. La demande pour la dÃ©finition des faits doit Ãªtre faite
dans les trente jours qui suivent celui oÃ¹ la cause est mÃ»re pour le procÃ¨s.
Faute d'observer ces dÃ©lais, le demandeur perd tous ses droits au procÃ¨s par
jury.

Et, plus rÃ©cemment encore, dans Wise v. Boxenbaum[3]:â€”

Le droit au procÃ¨s par jury est un droit
d'exception; pour en pouvoir rÃ©clamer le bÃ©nÃ©fice, il faut se conformer
strictement aux exigences de la loi. Il ne suffit pas d'avoir optÃ© pour cette
forme de procÃ¨s et par lÃ  d'avoir acquis le droit de s'en prÃ©valoir; il faut
encore conserver ce droit en observant les dÃ©lais prescrits. Ainsi la
dÃ©finition des faits doit Ãªtre demandÃ©e dans les trente jours qui
suivent celui oÃ¹ la cause est mÃ»re pour le procÃ¨s; et la cause est mÃ»re pour le
procÃ¨s quand la contestation est liÃ©e, ou Ã  l'expiration du dÃ©lai dans lequel
elle devait l'Ãªtre. Faute d'observer ces dÃ©lais, la partie perd tous ses droits
au procÃ¨s par jury.

Je ne crois pas pouvoir, malgrÃ© les inconvÃ©nients
pratiques qui peuvent en rÃ©sulter, entretenir une opinion diffÃ©rente de celle
exprimÃ©e dans le jugement dont il y a appel, et je le confirmerais.

L'appelant a citÃ© le prÃ©cÃ©dent de Lord v. La
Reine[4]. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait de savoir si
les articles 1020 et 1209 du Code de ProcÃ©dure Civile de la province
de QuÃ©bec, qui limitent le temps pour prÃ©senter une inscription devant la Cour
du Banc du Roi, imposent des conditions impÃ©ratives sans lesquelles la cour d'appel n'a pas juridiction, et si les parties
peuvent de consentement prolonger ces dÃ©lais. La Cour en est venue Ã  la
conclusion qu'il s'agissait d'une question de procÃ©dure, oÃ¹ les parties
pouvaient donner un consentement valide. Je ne crois pas, cependant, que cette
dÃ©cision puisse Ãªtre interprÃ©tÃ©e comme voulant dire que les parties peuvent
consentir Ã  soumettre leur litige Ã  un jury quand ce dernier n'a plus juridiction
pour l'entendre.

Quant Ã  l'autre prÃ©cÃ©dent de cette Cour, The Montreal Tramways v. SÃ©guin[5], je crois qu'il n'a aucune application dans
l'espÃ¨ce. Dans cette cause, on s'est demandÃ© si les parties avaient oui ou non
droit Ã  un procÃ¨s par jury; mais la demande avait Ã©tÃ© faite dans les dÃ©lais
prÃ©vus au code. Personne ne s'y Ã©tait objectÃ©, et cette Cour a dÃ©cidÃ©, en
consÃ©quence, qu'il y avait acquiescement et chose jugÃ©e sur ce point, et qu'on
ne pouvait pas invoquer ce moyen devant un tribunal d'appel. Dans le cas
actuel, lorsque le

[Page 470]

jury a Ã©tÃ© convoquÃ©, l'intimÃ© s'est objectÃ© Ã  cette
convocation vu l'expiration des dÃ©lais, et on ne peut en consÃ©quence lui
reprocher un acquiescement ou invoquer contre lui l'autoritÃ© de la chose jugÃ©e.

Pour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d'opinion que
les deux appels de l'appelant doivent Ãªtre rejetÃ©s avec dÃ©pens et vu la
conclusion Ã  laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres moyens
soulevÃ©s par l'appelant.

	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 6 November 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three offences: first, that on 28 November 2012 he supplied cocaine having a total weight of 2.75 ounces; secondly, between 29 February and 28 November 2012 he supplied more than an indictable and less than the commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (head); and, thirdly, between 9am and 12pm on 28 November 2012 he dealt with $21,400 knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The first two offences were contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), carrying maximum penalties respectively of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units, and 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. The last offence was contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	When the applicant appeared in the District Court for sentence, he asked that three offences should be taken into account on a Form 1: possessing 1 tablet of methylene dioxymethamphetamine (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); possessing two vials of a steroid, a prescribed restricted substance (s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW), maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); and possession of four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds, a prohibited drug (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment).
	
	
	On 6 June 2014, the applicant was sentenced as follows: for the proceeds of crime offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 28 November 2012; for the supply cocaine offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 28 November 2012; and, for the supply cannabis offence (taking into account the matters on a Form 1), a sentence of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 28 November 2012. A discount of 25 per cent was allowed for his early plea.
	
	
	The primary judge sentenced the applicant for the cannabis offence upon the mistaken basis that the applicable maximum term of imprisonment was 15 years. This error, conceded by the Crown, means that the sentence for this offence cannot stand. It is not controversial that this Court must itself consider the appropriate sentence for this offence and, if a lesser sentence is warranted in law, substitute that lesser sentence.
	


The facts


	
	These were not disputed. The following account is taken from the statement of agreed facts.
	
	
	On 28 November 2012 police executed a search warrant at the applicantâ€™s house. When they arrived, officers asked the applicant if there was anything in the house, to which he responded, â€œitâ€™s all on the bed. Youâ€™ll see itâ€. In the bedroom, the police found 17 clear plastic resealable plastic bags containing cannabis. In the kitchen they found more cannabis, stored inside a cupboard as well as in a vacuum sealed package in the spare room. Together, the cannabis weighed 8.7kg. Police located also a large storage bag in the garage containing 80 empty vacuum bags smelling strongly of cannabis. The applicant told police that some of these bags had previously contained cannabis that he had either sold or used personally over the previous eight months. He indicated that the bags would have contained from between two and eight pounds but that, at times, they would be double or triple bagged to conceal the strong odour. The agreed facts noted that, using the lowest weight provided by the applicant, on the assumption that all of the bags were double bags, the total quantity of cannabis was 36kg. Allowing for the applicantâ€™s claim that he had used some of it, the applicant would have supplied close to 25kg of cannabis over the preceding eight months. This was said in the agreed facts to relate to count one. However, whilst the facts certainly concede the supply of cannabis beyond the quantity found in his possession of 8.7kg, it is clear that the calculation assumed facts which were not admitted. Firstly, the applicant only admitted that â€œsome of these bags had previously contained cannabisâ€ and that â€œat times they would either be double or triple baggedâ€. But this is not an admission that all the bags were used. A fact which is adverse to an offender cannot be based upon an assumption. It may be established beyond reasonable doubt by evidence or admission but an admission as to a calculation based on an assumption which is not admitted is clearly insufficient. Furthermore, in respect of cannabis leaf, the indictable quantity is 1kg whilst the commercial quantity is 25kg. The 8.7kg of cannabis in the applicantâ€™s possession at the time of his arrest together with â€œclose to 25kg of cannabisâ€ suggested to have been supplied during the period comprehended by the charge would have amounted to a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, which was not alleged. It seems to me that the appropriate approach for present purposes to this issue is to sentence the applicant upon the basis that he had 8.7kg of cannabis in possession at the time of his arrest, mostly but not all for the purpose of supply (he was a heavy user) and that he would have supplied a significant but unknown quantity of cannabis leaf during the previous eight months. He cannot be sentenced on the basis that he had either in his possession for supply or had in fact supplied as much as 25kg.
	
	
	Returning to the facts, the applicant directed police to search the kitchen, where they located 12 resealable bags, one of which contained an ecstasy tablet, whilst inside the fridge police also located two vials of steroid medication and, inside a built in wardrobe in the spare room, four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds (otherwise not quantified). Possession of these substances comprised the three charges on the Form 1. Also in the kitchen the applicant directed police to a plastic bag containing cocaine in a corner cupboard. This, together with two small knotted bags of cocaine found in the wardrobe in his bedroom totalled 74.6g of cocaine at 65 per cent purity and constituted the second charge. Police found wads of cash of $15,000 and $6,400 in two separate bags in the bedside table of the applicantâ€™s bedroom, the applicant admitting that this was the proceeds of the sales of drugs. This constituted charge three.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested, taken into custody, and ultimately participated in an electronically recorded interview confirming the admissions he had made during the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	On 16 October 2012 he had committed the offence of driving whilst disqualified and, on 26 March 2013 (whilst he was in custody on the present charges) he was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 28 November 2012. Accordingly, as the primary judge observed, the applicant had been in custody in respect of the drug offences alone since 27 May 2013.
	


Subjective features


	
	These are not controversial. The applicant is now 38 years of age. His criminal record was characterised by the primary judge as â€œminorâ€ comprising convictions for driving whilst disqualified, stating a false name, exceeding the speed limit, affray, obtaining money by deception, displaying unauthorised number plates, driving whilst licence suspended, using an uninsured and unregistered motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. So far as the sentence of imprisonment for the offence of driving whilst disqualified is concerned, the learned primary judge considered that a gaol sentence may well not have been imposed had he not been in custody for the present charges. Mr Barrow, counsel for the applicant in this Court, points out that his previous offence was three years earlier and, but for his being bail refused on the present charges, a non-custodial disposition could well have resulted but was not available as he was in custody. The Crown submits that he would likely have been sentenced to imprisonment at all events. In my view this Court should approach the matter in the same way as did the primary judge.
	
	
	Tendered on the sentence proceedings was a drug and alcohol report prepared by Corrective Services. It noted that the applicant scored â€œextremely high in the range which requires more intensive treatment in some domains specifically around his cannabis and cocaine useâ€. It noted his strong desire to address his alcohol and drug use and had expressed an interest in attending a rehabilitation program within the community. Programs are available within the custodial setting, providing he is assessed as suitable for them. A report from Mr Bradley Jones, a forensic psychologist, was also tendered. The history in that report was used as a basis for the primary judgeâ€™s consideration of his background. The following is drawn from her Honourâ€™s reasons for sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was raised in a family of African descent although he, himself, is Caucasian. He was born in Australia and his mother moved to Tanzania, ultimately returning to Australia when he was aged four years. He enjoyed a stable and loving upbringing and speaks highly of his mother, a devout Catholic and his stepfather. He completed year 10 at school and went on to complete a mechanicâ€™s course, undertaking an apprenticeship in a repair shop. Thereafter he worked for a number of mechanics and commenced his own business which, however, failed after he lost his license as a result of driving offences. The applicant commenced consuming alcohol at the age of 18 and to abuse marijuana when he was 22. His consumption of this drug increased significantly over the next 12 years. He has experimented with ecstasy and has also been a heavy user of cocaine. He experienced a significant trauma when, in 1999, one of his stepbrothers petrol bombed the residence where he and another brother were staying and both men suffered significant emotional distress and physical injuries as a result. Following the petrol bombing and the loss of his business, his drug addiction increased significantly. He had been receiving psychological treatment for some four years before his arrest but continues to suffer flashbacks and nightmares. The report notes that the applicant has expressed shame and regret at his offending behaviour saying, â€œI was blinded by drugs, Iâ€™m glad I was caught, I was over the topâ€. In the opinion of the psychologist, the applicant suffers from anxiety and depression and needs cognitive behavioural therapy, drug release prevention counselling, cognitive training and monitoring upon his release from custody by the Community Corrections Service. The psychologist considered that he has insight into the basis of his offending behaviour, his maladaptive thought processes and his depression and noted his willingness to engage in a treatment program. He has established a connection with the chaplaincy service at the correctional centres where he has been held and appears to have been doing well in prison, engaging with the drug and alcohol counsellor and undertaking studies which will be useful on his release.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest the applicant was in a relationship and has a four year old child from that relationship.
	
	
	It is a significant matter to be taken into account that, were it not for the applicantâ€™s admissions that he had been supplying cannabis over something like eight months before his arrest and his candid estimate of the quantity involved, it would have been virtually impossible for the Crown to prove the extent of his criminal activities over and above what was found in his possession, although no doubt it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that he had been trading in an unknown quantity in addition to that found in his possession. The primary judge considered that the applicantâ€™s criminal antecedents, as I have mentioned, were relatively minor and did not disentitle him to leniency. Her Honour also concluded that he was truly remorseful and contrite but his prospects for rehabilitation were guarded because of the extent of his addictions. She considered that the applicant was in need of intensive rehabilitation for a lengthy period if he were to become and remain law abiding. I agree with these conclusions which were not, at all events, really disputed. The need for a long period of supervised parole justifies a finding of special circumstances warranting a variation of the calculus prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The scale of drug supply is obviously significant and naturally focuses attention on the amount of cannabis involved. I have already discussed the difficulties in determining this quantity. It is fair to say, as the Crown submitted, that his supply was not an isolated event and could not be regarded as a temporary aberration. The supply of significant quantities of cannabis is plainly a serious offence, marked by the maximum term of imprisonment its commission attracts. It took place over a period of eight months and produced at least the cash which was found in the applicantâ€™s possession on his arrest. The objective seriousness of the applicantâ€™s offence is significant but very far short of the worst case. Since, essentially, he is to be sentenced in respect of the marijuana offence for selling drugs, it appears to me to be double counting to punish him additionally for dealing with the proceeds of those sales. That the primary judge made the sentence for that offence wholly concurrent with the supply of marijuana charge is not surprising and this Court should take the same approach.
	


The other offences


	
	It was submitted by the Crown in this Court that there should be a degree of accumulation in respect of the cannabis and cocaine charges, pointing to Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285 in which the applicant was convicted of the deemed supply of 19.72g of crystalline methylamphetamine and 7.29g of heroin. The Court observed â€“
	


â€œ[32] Possession of the two different kinds of drugs giving rise to the â€˜deemed supplyâ€™ offences is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality. There were two deemed supplies, as there would be two (or more) actual supplies were the different drugs to be sold to two (or more) purchasers in the course of the applicantâ€™s drug dealing ...â€

(The appellant in that case had also been found in the possession of a prohibited and an unregistered pistol.) Dealing with the drug offences, the sentence imposed for the heroin offence was 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months and, for the crystalline methylamphetamine offence, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. They were accumulated by 6 months. It is apparent that the Court did not consider this accumulation as suggestive of error.


	
	It is relevant to note, in respect of the overall quantity of cocaine, that the history he gave to the psychologist, which was not sought to be disputed either below or in this Court, was that the applicant had commenced consuming cocaine for about two years before the offence, rising to 7g daily. The cocaine, which he was deemed to have in possession for supply, was not an insignificant quantity and it is appropriate to accumulate the sentence for this offence to some degree on the sentence to be imposed in respect of the supplying marijuana.
	
	
	So far as the Form 1 offences are concerned, it seems to me virtually certain that, either individually or taken together, they would not have resulted in a custodial sentence. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to add a period of custody in respect of them. Nor do they indicate anything of significance in relation to the substantive offences.
	


Assessment


	
	Mr Barrow brought to the Courtâ€™s attention the Judicial Commissionâ€™s statistics for supply of less than a commercial quantity of cannabis. Although the sample is reasonably high (87 cases), since it is not known what proportion of these involve a quantity of drugs greater than the indictable quantity, let alone the quantities themselves, they are not of much use. The statistics of cases involving the supply of a commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (which of course must be regarded as much more serious, having a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years), involve 24 cases. Only 58 per cent of these offences attracted prison sentences, which is rather surprising. In 14 cases, the sentences ranged between 2 years and 4 years, 6 months. Although we were given the figures for non-parole periods, I do not think these are at all useful, given the very wide range of special circumstances that might or might not have been applied. The statistics are informative at a somewhat doubtful level of significance. A number of particular cases were also referred to but I do not regard them as presently useful and it is unnecessary to discuss them further.
	
	
	In my view the appropriate commencing point for sentencing the applicant in respect of the cannabis offence is 5 years and 6 months which, with a 25 per cent discount, yields an overall sentence of 4 years and 9 months. It is in the public interest as well in that of the applicant to find (as did the primary judge) that special circumstances justify varying what I have called the statutory calculus to provide for an extended period of supervision, which the applicant will need if he is to maintain an appropriate level of treatment for his drug addiction. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The offence for the proceeds of crime should be wholly concurrent with the other sentences. The cannabis supply offence should in my view be accumulated by four months on the cocaine supply offence. I therefore propose the following orders â€“
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Set aside the sentences imposed by the District Court on 6 June 2014, in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows:
	



	
	for the supply of cocaine on 28 November 2012, a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 28 November 2012 and expiring on 27 November 2014;
	
	
	for the supply of cannabis leaf between 29 February 2012 and 28 November 2012 (taking into account the offences on the Form 1) a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 28 March 2013 and expiring on 27 September 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 28 September 2015 and expiring on 27 December 2017; and
	
	
	for the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime a term of imprisonment of twelve months commencing on 28 March 2013.
	
	
	The first date upon which the appellant is eligible to be considered for parole is 27 September 2015.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Adams J.

		24 September 2015",23/9/2015 0:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708715,"McLEAN, Michael v R [2011] NSWCCA 273","Judgment 

1THE COURT : On 20 July 2011, the Court made orders allowing the appellant's appeal, setting aside his conviction and directing an acquittal. These are the reasons for those orders. 

2The appellant was tried by a jury before a judge of the District Court at Parramatta between 31 August and 10 September 2009, on a single count of robbery whilst in the company of unknown persons contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 97(1). 

3He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and four months with a non-parole period of four years and four months. 

4The ground of the appeal was that the trial miscarried as the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1). 

5There was no issue as to the operative legal principle to apply to dispose of the appeal. Whilst the Court has due regard to both the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence and the primacy of the jury verdict, it makes its own independent assessment of the quality and sufficiency of the whole of the evidence at the trial and determines for itself whether there was a reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the appellant: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 571 at [11]-[14], [20]-[25], [37], [40]-[48] and [78]-[80]; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487. 

6The relevant facts from and concerning the trial can be shortly stated as follows. At about 3.50 pm on 24 March 2009, Easter Monday afternoon, three men attended Medusa Jewellers on Church Street at Parramatta. One man stood outside the store, while the two other males entered, having been admitted by the owner Mr Nathan Sobbi who released the door lock. Mr Sobbi's evidence was that while examining jewellery one of the two offenders in the shop lifted his shirt to reveal a gun. Mr Sobbi was directed to comply with directions of this man to open the display cabinets. He was then taken to the back of the store, where the safes were opened. This man demanded the CCTV recordings which were given to him. Mr Sobbi was then tied up. Some time later, he set off an alarm and rang the police. His shop had, of course, been robbed. 

7When the police arrived swabs were taken from arm marks on the glass counter. 

8The appellant had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from one of the swabs at the scene. 

9There are a number of aspects of the evidence which persuaded us that there was a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt. 

10The first aspect was the description of the two men. The man who showed the gun to Mr Sobbi was said to be of ""Australian"" appearance and to have a tattoo on his neck. The appellant does not have a tattoo on his neck. The second man was said to be wearing an Hawaiian shirt with short sleeves and sunglasses. No mention was made of any tattoos. The appellant has prominent tattoos on his forearms. Mr Sobbi, who is Persian, also described the second man in the shop as ""Middle Eastern, could be Lebanese people or Egyptian or Persian people"". He described the third man outside similarly. The appellant is not of those ethnic descriptions. 

11Thus, not only was there no identification evidence implicating the appellant at the store in the company of the two other men at the time of the robbery, but also such evidence as there was raised a doubt as to the likelihood of the appellant being one of the men. 

12The DNA evidence was the only evidence linking the accused with the crime. Whilst the appellant's counsel put detailed written submissions on DNA evidence, his argument on appeal ultimately did not challenge the reliability of the scientific evidence. There is no call, therefore, to deal with any of the cases on DNA evidence. 

13It was necessary therefore for the balance of the evidence to be sufficient to leave no reasonable doubt that the DNA was left by the appellant in the shop during the robbery. 

14Three bodies of evidence were relevant to this factual issue: the record of interview of the appellant with the police, the evidence of the cleaning of the glass counter by Mr Sobbi on which the swab was found, and the evidence of who may have entered the shop that day and in days before. 

15The interview was conducted some ten months after the robbery. It is unnecessary to set out the whole of the relevant terms of the interview. Crucial to the case of the prosecution was the obtaining of a clear denial by the appellant that he had ever been in this shop. An edited version of the ERISP and the DVD of the edited version were in evidence. The transcript as a whole is simply an inadequate basis to conclude that there was any clear denial ofhis being in this shop at any time. The shop was inadequately, and to a degree inaccurately, described by the police at the interview and the denial, such as it was, was equivocal. 

16We should add at this point that we raised with counsel at the appeal the possibility that the trial miscarried by inadequate representation because of what could be seen to have been agreed to be excised from the transcript exhibit. This matter did not have to be addressed because we came to the firm view that the evidence as led admitted necessarily of a reasonable doubt. 

17The evidence of Mr Sobbi as to when he cleaned the glass was connected with his evidence of trading on the day in question and of his usual practice. The shop had been closed on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday previously. During the course of a normal trading day he would clean the glass at least four times a day with window cleaner and cloth. On the day in question, he opened at 10.30 am. He would usually clean the cabinets at the beginning of the day. The evidence was not taken from any particular recollection, but from his usual practice. 

18Mr Sobbi gave evidence that there were customers that day, before the robbery. Mr Sobbi could not remember them. The evidence was insufficient to conclude that the door was locked all day. Sometimes he left it open, enabling people to walk in. 

19From this material there was no basis to conclude that the appellant did not visit the shop in the morning or early afternoon of the day in question. Though it is unlikely, given the practice of Mr Sobbi as to cleaning, it was possible that the DNA was left the previous week. Even if that can be discounted there was ample time for the appellant to have visited the shop that day. The ERISP did not, with any clarity at all, eliminate that reasonable possibility. 

20When one combines the above with the disconformities in identification - the lack of tattoo identification and the ethnicity identification, we were persuaded that the doubt about the conviction was reason

		16 December 2011",15/12/2011 0:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
6455470,Nisan v R [2017] NSWCCA 265,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Schmidt J and the orders which she proposes.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: In October 2014 Mr Nisan was driving a truck which was involved in a collision at the intersection of Warringah and Pittwater Roads, Dee Why. A number of people were seriously injured, including Mr Nisan. In November 2016, after a judge alone trial, Mr Nisan was convicted of two charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and acquitted of four counts of wilful neglect occasioning bodily harm: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan was later sentenced to terms of imprisonment respectively of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 4 April 2018 and 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, dating from 4 April 2017: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 27 April 2017, unrep).
	
	
	Mr Nisan has appealed both his conviction and sentence.
	
	
	Mr Nisanâ€™s case was that he had been wrongly convicted and that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive and inconsistent with the reasons earlier given by the trial judge in the conviction judgment. On appeal the grounds Mr Nisan advanced were:
	


â€œConviction Appeal

1.Â Â Â The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence over objection expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruller relating to brake force efficiency in circumstances where the opinions were based on assumption that could not be made out in the evidence.

2.Â Â Â The trial judge erred in admitted[sic] into evidence over objection as expert opinion evidence of Mr John Ruiler[sic] concerning the record of interview of the Appellant where that opinion evidence was outside the scope of his expertise.

3.Â Â Â That the trial judge wrongly held that on the evidence there was no reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt and the verdicts were unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable in the circumstances.

4.Â Â Â The trial judge erred in failing to give adequate reasons for her decision.

Particulars

a.Â Â Â finding that when the appellant said in his record of interview ""the top of the hill"" he meant May Road and not west of Alfred Street.

b.Â Â Â rejecting the evidence of Dr Hart and accepting the evidence of Mr Ruller.

c.Â Â Â failing to address the submissions of the appellant relating to the credibility and reliability of Senior Constable Ben Wilson.

Severity Appeal

1.Â Â Â That trial judge erred in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in circumstances where that assessment was inconsistent with the trial judge's verdict and reasons for verdict.

2.Â Â Â That the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.â€

The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	This was not a case which involved either death or deliberately dangerous conduct. It turned on whether it was brake failure, or Mr Nisanâ€™s driving, that had caused the collision.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal the Crown conceded that the sentence imposed on Mr Nisan was very high. That concession was properly made.
	
	
	The truck was not owned by Mr Nisan, who was an employed driver. The evidence established that some of the truckâ€™s brakes were out of adjustment and in cross-examination the Crownâ€™s expert Mr Ruller (a crash scene investigator), said that he would not have driven the truck with the brakes in that state. There was no suggestion that Mr Nisan knew or should have known what the state of the brakes was.
	
	
	As I will come to explain, it is not entirely clear that in the conviction judgment the trial judge concluded that regardless of what conclusion was reached as to the number of brakes which were out of adjustment â€œthe Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accidentâ€. If that was not the conclusion reached, for reasons which I will explain, it ought to have been.
	
	
	If this was the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion, it is impossible to see how, consistently with that conclusion, her Honour then went on to â€œreject beyond reasonable doubt that brake fade was a cause of the accidentâ€.
	
	
	Her Honour later also observed that she had â€œa reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted in a conscious way or was conscious of his breach of the necessary standard of careâ€ and that â€œ[t]here is no evidence that he intended to drive in the way he did, or acted recklessly, rather than events overtaking himâ€.
	
	
	These findings were relevant on sentence to the assessment of the objective seriousness of Mr Nisanâ€™s offences and his moral culpability for that offending. Despite making these findings, her Honour rejected his case that his moral culpability was low. Instead, her Honour concluded that it fell at the higher end of the scale; that the objective seriousness of his offending also fell at the higher end of the range; and that â€œall the circumstances demonstrate the abandonment of responsibilityâ€.
	
	
	I am satisfied that neither those conclusions, nor the resulting sentences imposed on Mr Nisan, were properly open on the evidence received at trial and involved relevant error: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40.
	
	
	Had I come to the conclusion that the conviction appeal should be dismissed, it would thus have been necessary to uphold the sentence appeal. Given that I consider that the conviction appeal must be upheld, it is unnecessary to consider the sentence appeal further.
	


Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted


	
	The onus fell on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of Mr Nisanâ€™s driving was dangerous. Satisfaction on the balance of probabilities, or a finding of negligence could not result in his conviction of the dangerous driving charges which were found proven.
	
	
	For reasons which I will explain more fully in relation to the grounds of appeal, I consider that Mr Nisan was wrongly convicted; that his appeal must be upheld; and that he must be acquitted of both charges.
	
	
	In her judgment, the trial judge observed that the Crownâ€™s case was that Mr Nisan had failed to control his fully laden truck, while driving down the steep incline to the intersection â€“ safe driving requiring him to reduce his speed sufficiently, so that he could adhere to the 20kph speed limit, which applied to trucks on the steep descent at Warringah Hill. The Crown argued that during this descent, Mr Nisan had to drive in a gear no higher than third and to engage the truckâ€™s exhaust brake. He had failed to do so, with the result that he had driven at excessive speed in the circumstances and in too high a gear.
	
	
	Mr Nisanâ€™s case was that the brakes were not roadworthy and had been poorly adjusted, making them vulnerable to brake failure or fading. That was what had caused the accident, by preventing him from slowing the truck to the 20kph speed limit, as he had attempted to do.
	
	
	There was no issue that Mr Nisan was the driver of the truck and that the applicable Road Rule 108 of the Road Rules 2008 (NSW), required that on a road where a â€œtrucks and buses low gear signâ€ applies, trucks must be driven in a gear low enough to limit the speed of the truck, without the use of primary breaks.
	
	
	It was also common ground that when Mr Nisan reached the intersection, the truck was travelling at a speed of some 65kph. The evidence established that if it was driven in low range, the maximum speed of the truck was 40kph. On investigation after the collision, the truck was found to be in low range, but not in gear. Being in neutral allowed its speed to increase to 65kph, even though it was in low range.
	
	
	Mr Nisan did not give evidence at trial, but both at the scene and afterwards, he made statements to police about what had caused the collision. On his accounts, the collision occurred because the truckâ€™s brakes had failed. Those statements were considered by the partiesâ€™ experts, Mr Ruller and Dr Hart (a qualified engineer and electrical and mechanical engineering consultant).
	
	
	Mr Cowie, an experienced truck driver who witnessed the accident and was accepted to have relevant expertise, given that experience, gave evidence about what he observed and found when he lent aid at the scene of the collision. Other experts, Constable Wilson (a mechanic) and Dr White (a forensic mechanical engineer), had tested the vehicle.
	
	
	There were many differences of opinion between the experts. Many of the critical differences lying between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart were resolved in cross-examination.
	
	
	Evidence was also called from the owner of the truck, the mechanic who had maintained the brakes and the truckâ€™s manufacturer. From this evidence it emerged that while the brakes had been maintained, the owner had supplied the â€œafter marketâ€ brake linings which had been used on the last occasion they were adjusted, the month prior to the collision. They were not recommended by the manufacturer, but were not tested by either Constable Wilson or Dr White, to determine whether overheating had contributed to brake failure, as was Dr Hartâ€™s opinion.
	
	
	The expert evidence ought to have led her Honour to the conclusion that the Crown could not exclude the possibility that it was the state of the brakes which had caused the collision, rather than Mr Nisanâ€™s driving. That was because it finally became common ground between Mr Ruller and Dr Hart, that the brakes had faded during the truckâ€™s descent down Warringah Hill. Where that occurred was what remained in issue.
	
	
	In concluding that Mr Nisanâ€™s driving was dangerous, her Honour did not consider the evidence about whether the â€˜after marketâ€™ brake linings had caused, or contributed to the brakes fading. That was relevant to the question of where it was that the brakes faded.
	
	
	Even so, I consider that Mr Rullerâ€™s concession in cross-examination that the condition of the brakes was such that he would not have knowingly driven this truck and the common view of Dr Hart and Mr Ruller, that if the brakes had been working properly, they would have been capable of stopping this truck on the descent, it was not open to her Honour to find that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Nisanâ€™s driving was dangerous, or that it had caused the collision.
	


Ground 1 â€“ admission of expert evidence based on assumptions


	
	Mr Rullerâ€™s opinions rested on a series of identified assumptions. They included brake temperatures, on which various of his calculations were based, and what Mr Nisan had meant by some of his responses during his police interview.
	
	
	The trial judge rejected the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep).
	
	
	Dr Hartâ€™s opinions also rested on various assumptions, including as to the brakes having overheated and what Mr Nisan had meant by his police interview responses.
	
	
	Mr Cowieâ€™s evidence provided an objective basis for the conclusion that the brakes had overheated, given what he described smelling at the scene of the collision. Mr Ruller agreed that this indicated overheating and conceded that there was no way to verify the actual temperatures which the truckâ€™s various brakes had reached.
	
	
	On Mr Nisanâ€™s case on appeal, that it was not possible to establish the temperature of the brakes was fatal to the admissibility of Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705; [2001] NSWCA 305. Further, it was argued that her Honourâ€™s reasons revealed that she had concerned herself with whether there was any basis for the defence to argue that overheating was a significant issue, in relation to the effectiveness of the brakes, rather than the admissibility of Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence.
	
	
	In the circumstances Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence should not have been admitted and in the absence of his opinions, the Crownâ€™s case should have been rejected as not having established Mr Nisanâ€™s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In rejecting the objection to Mr Ruller's evidence, the trial judge noted that the only evidence of overheating of the brakes came from Mr Cowie, who said that such overheating had been suggested to him by an asbestos-type smell. In his interview with police, Mr Nisan had not said anything about having had any trouble with the brakes, up until this occasion. Her Honour also noted evidence that in normal circumstances, there would have been no heating of the brakes.
	
	
	After referring to evidence foreshadowed in the defence case and to Heydon JAâ€™s observations in Makita at [85], her Honour concluded that Mr Ruller's opinions, while based on assumptions, were â€œnot assumptions without having a grounding or founding in his knowledge and expertise and, in my view, he is entitled to give the estimates he has givenâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 16 October 2016, unrep) at 3.
	
	
	Makita was considered in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588; [2011] HCA 21. What was there decided has since been repeatedly considered by this Court. Recently in Taub v R [2017] NSWCCA 198, Simpson JA observed, for example:
	


â€œ27 Â Â Â The plurality in Dasreef refined Heydon JAâ€™s seven admissibility criteria in Makita to two:


	
	that the witness who gives the evidence â€œhas specialised knowledge based on the personâ€™s training, study or experienceâ€; and
	
	
	that the opinion expressed in the evidence by the witness â€œis wholly or substantially based on that knowledgeâ€ ([32]).
	


28 Â Â Â What was in issue in Dasreef was whether the opinion expressed by the witness proffered as an expert was based on the witnessâ€™ specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience.

29 Â Â Â The plurality added (citing [85] of Makita) that:

â€œâ€¦ ordinarily â€¦ â€˜the expertâ€™s evidence must explain how the field of â€˜specialised knowledgeâ€™ in which the witness is expert by reason of â€˜training, study or experienceâ€™, and on which the opinion is â€˜wholly or substantially basedâ€™, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propoundedâ€™.â€ ([37])

30 Â Â Â This, it appears to me, states a third criterion of admissibility. Their Honours then emphasised (at [42]) that satisfaction of the criteria is a matter that goes to the admissibility of, not the weight to be attributed to, the opinion evidence.

31 Â Â Â The plurality declined to engage with the question whether the â€œproof of assumption ruleâ€ (what their Honours called â€œthe basis ruleâ€) existed at common law; such a rule, their Honours said, was directed to the facts of a particular case. From that it might be inferred that their Honours considered that whether the facts upon which the opinion was based are established as true is a question that goes not to admissibility, but to the weight to be attributed to the opinion expressed. This is also the analysis of Schmidt J in Kyluk Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage (2013) 298 ALR 532; [2013] NSWCCA 114 at [176]-[177].

32 Â Â Â It seems to me that the difference between Heydon J and the plurality lies in the rigour with which Heydon J would insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth, or correctness, of the assumptions or facts forming the foundation of the opinion as a condition of admissibility and at the time admissibility is being considered. It is not the position of Heydon J that, before evidence of the opinion could be admitted, it was necessary that the assumptions or facts be proved to be true or correct; rather, it was necessary that it be shown that ultimately the evidence would be capable of establishing that the facts or assumptions were true or correct. To insist on the availability of evidence to prove the truth of the assumptions enhances efficiency of the trial process (see [127]). Whether the evidence succeeds in establishing the truth of the facts is a question for the trier of fact.

33 Â Â Â The plurality, on the other hand, would allow admission of the opinion evidence provided the reasoning was exposed, reserving to the tribunal of fact whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the truth or correctness of the assumptions or facts. Failure to prove the truth of the assumptions would render the opinion evidence of little or no value.â€


	
	It follows that the trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence. If, however, at trial the Crown failed to prove the assumptions on which Mr Rullerâ€™s opinions rested, they would be of little or no value, in establishing the Crown case, as her Honour observed in the conviction judgment.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence, the trial judge noted, for example, that he had used the wrong graph in coming to conclusions about the power of the exhaust brake. Her Honour did not conclude that his opinion about this was of little or no value, because it had no foundation, as the trial judge had earlier indicated would be her approach. She observed, however, that this â€œunderminesâ€ Mr Ruller: see R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 21.
	
	
	Her Honour also referred to Mr Rullerâ€™s concessions that a critical assumption he had made about the brake temperature could not be verified; that the front brakes had been poorly adjusted; and that there had been brake fade, albeit in his view, near the end of the descent on Warringah Hill. Despite this, and without referring to the evidence she had earlier noted Dr Hart had given about the â€˜after marketâ€™ brake linings contributing to the overheating of the brakes and their fading, her Honour accepted Mr Rullerâ€™s opinion that â€œthe brakes, albeit not perfect, were not determinative of the eventsâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 22 November 2016, unrep) at 32. This approach did not accord with that of the plurality in Dasreef, or that which her Honour had said that she would adopt.
	
	
	Despite this, the first ground of appeal must be rejected. The trial judge did not err in admitting Mr Rullerâ€™s evidence. If the assumptions on which his opinions were based were not established by the evidence led at trial, they could not, however be relied on in determining whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Ground 4 â€“ the reasons given were inadequate


	
	It is convenient to next deal with ground 4.
	
	
	The obligation to give reasons in a judge alone trial is governed by s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The trial judge was also obliged to explain the reasons for the findings of fact which she made: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250; [1998] HCA 68 at [30] and to expose her reasoning process: Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [6].
	


The conviction judgment


	
	The conviction judgment was delivered orally on 21 and 22 November 2016, after judgment was reserved on 26 October. Mr Nisanâ€™s case that the majority of the judgment dealt with an outline of the evidence and the partiesâ€™ submissions must be accepted.
	
	
	There was no issue taken with the various binding principles to which the trial judge referred. She also noted that the test of whether Mr Nisan had been driving dangerously was an objective one, which did not require the Crown to establish that he knew or realised that he was driving the truck in a dangerous manner. Her Honour also observed that the Crown's case was circumstantial and that Mr Nisan had advanced two hypotheses consistent with his innocence:
	


â€œ1Â Â Â Dr White is (reasonably) possibly correct. If Dr White is possibly correct then it is possible the truckâ€™s foot brakes were unroadworthy and if the truckâ€™s foot brakes were unroadworthy then the truck itself is unroadworthy.

2Â Â Â If Dr White is wrong and Mr Ruller is correct, based on Senior Constable Wilsonâ€™s measurements Mr Ruller says the front brakes were poorly adjusted, then Dr Hart says even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade and brake fade was the cause of the accidentâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 9.


	
	The trial judge referred extensively to a chronology of relevant events, including dates when the brakes had been adjusted prior to the collision, the last time on 11 September 2014. Her Honour then turned to explain where the collision occurred on 21 October 2014, before turning to the Crown which was explained to be:
	


â€œThe Crown submitted the Crown case is that the accused failed to control a fully laden truck down a steep decline, such that it struck a number of cars at the intersection of Pittwater Road and Warringah Road, seriously injuring two persons in a Mazda 2 and injuring four others. The Crown case is that in order to drive safely down a steep decline the accused needed to reduce his speed sufficiently so that he could adhere to the signposted 20 kilometre per hour sign which, for this truck, meant that he could not have been in more than third gear. He should have engaged the exhaust brake but he did not. The Crown case is that the accused was travelling at an excessive speed in the circumstances and was consequently in too high a gear to drive safely down the decline.

His actions thereafter only made it more likely that the outcome would be disastrous, in that he tried to gear down, which at least disengages the engine and therefore the ability to brake, or worse, can end up in the engine going into the wrong, that is a higher, gear, making it more difficult to brake, or at worst, that the truck goes into neutral gear and therefore has far less ability to brake. Secondly, that he did not use the exhaust brake which, if engaged, has a retarding effect on the engine. Third, that he attempted to use the hand brake which, in normal circumstances, cannot be engaged whilst the service brake is engaged.

He was at this point, the Crown said, panicking, as he acknowledged in the later part of his interview, because, the Crown says, he knew the peril he was inâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 18 â€“ 19.


	
	The circumstances relied on by the Crown were identified to be:
	


â€œ1.Â Â Â That the truck was travelling at an excessive speed, about 65 kilometres per hour, immediately prior to impact;

2.Â Â Â That the gearstick was in neutral post-impact;

3.Â Â Â That the exhaust brake was not engaged;

4.Â Â Â That the brakes were serviceable, albeit not at maximum braking efficiency;

5.Â Â Â That the accused admitted he was the driver (no dispute);

6.Â Â Â The accused denied speeding and asserted brake failure. The Crown submits this is unreliable; and

7.Â Â Â He was going about 40 kilometres per hour at the third pair of 20 kilometre per hour signsâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 22 â€“ 23.


	
	Her Honour then observed that the Crown had the onus of â€œexcluding to my satisfaction that guilt is the only rational hypotheses or reasonable inferenceâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 23.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to the expert evidence, noting that its value depended on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the experts had used, in order to arrive at their opinions. Her Honour noted that there were conflicts between the opinions of Mr Ruller, Constable Wilson, Dr Hart and Dr White. She then outlined their respective opinions and what they were based on, in considerable detail, noting that only Constable Wilson had physically examined the truck, in a condition which was said to be the same as at the time of the collision.
	
	
	As to Mr Ruller, her Honour noted that in summary, his opinions were:
	


â€œ1. Â Â Â The signage along Warringah Road was sufficient and provided ample warning to drivers of heavy vehicles that there was a steep descent ahead.

2. Â Â Â The brakes fitted to the truck were in proper working order with the exception of the front brakes. In particular the front left steer brake was out of adjustment. The front right steer brake was almost out of adjustment.

3. Â Â Â All four wheel groups on the drive and lazy axles had sufficient brake adjustment. If the brakes were operating at a temperature under 300 degrees Fahrenheit they would have had sufficient brake adjustment to allow for wheel lockup.

4. Â Â Â If the four wheel groups on the drive axles had an operational brake temperature about 400 degrees Fahrenheit there would be a reduction in the brake efficiency. However, the brake adjustment would still have been sufficient to bring the truck to a stop from 65 kilometres per hour whilst on the descent towards Pittwater Road.

5. Â Â Â Based on the statements provided by Mr Nisan during interview, his knowledge of the exhaust brake would appear to be limited. It would be my opinion that the exhaust brake was not in operation at the time of the crash. This would reduce considerably the deceleration of the vehicle as it travelled down the hill.

6. Â Â Â The minimum gear that the truck would have been in at the top of the hill if the estimated speed of 40 kilometres per hour provided by Mr Nisan is accepted would have been fifth gear.

7. Â Â Â This incident is a direct result of Mr Nisan failing to reduce the speed of the truck and choosing the correct gearing prior to attempting to descend the hillâ€: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 30 â€“ 31.


	
	Later her Honour referred to the cross-examination where Mr Ruller agreed that in his second report he had said that the brakes on the steer axle were in poor condition and in need of adjustment and that the truck was not fit to be on the road and that the truck driver may not have been aware of this, until he started feeling that he had to use more air pressure.
	
	
	As to brake temperature, her Honour noted that without allowing for heat in the brakes, Mr Ruller assessed their overall efficiency to be about 85% and with heat above 400Â°F, about 77%, but that still allowed considerable braking of the truck: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 29.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted Mr Rullerâ€™s agreement with Dr White, that the truck's foundation brake assembly was roadworthy and in generally good condition, but that he had disagreed with his other conclusions, in whole or in part. She also noted Mr Rullerâ€™s observations about conclusions reached by Dr Hart and evidence which Mr Ruller gave in cross-examination, including that brake fade could have been a contributing factor to the accident, in its later stages: R v Nisan (District Court (NSW), Payne DCJ, 21 November 2016, unrep) at 39.
	
	
	After outlining the evidence of the other experts and what Mr Nisan had told police after the collision, her Honour noted that the Crown's case was that the truck was not suffering a mechanical defect, relevant to causation. She then turned to summarise, again in considerable detail, both the Crown and defence case, by reference to the evidence.
	
	
	Her Honour dealt with â€˜The Crown key pointsâ€, namely, â€œThe Brakes and the Expertsâ€ â€“ where she noted that it was â€œ[a]greed that poorly adjusted brakes fade at a lower temperature. Agreed between Hart and Ruller that brake fade played a part.â€ She then turned to â€œThe Interviewâ€ and â€œBrake Fadeâ€, observing that â€œThe experts agree that brake fade played a partâ€.
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to â€œThe defence key pointsâ€, beginning with â€œIntroductionâ€, then â€œMr Nisanâ€™s versionâ€, â€œThe consequences of having the front brakes out of alignmentâ€ and â€œThe brake force calculations of Mr Rullerâ€, noting the Crown case that the brakes were poorly adjusted. She then turned to â€œOther particulars of the offences alleged by the Crownâ€, beginning with â€œIncorrect gear selectionâ€, then â€œthe exhaust brakeâ€, â€œuse of handbrake , â€œgood characterâ€ and â€œspeed of truck at bottom of Hillâ€
	
	
	The trial judge then turned to â€œConclusionâ€. There had not earlier been a â€˜conclusionâ€™ section, when her Honour summarised the Crownâ€™s â€œkey pointsâ€. Whether what her Honour said at this point of her judgment, was intended to be an explanation of the defenceâ€™s final â€˜key pointsâ€™, or her Honourâ€™s conclusion, is not entirely clear. Her Honour said:
	


â€œThe Court must find that (a) it is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were; or (b) the condition of the brakes was as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted. Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident.

I will just go back. The Court must find that:

(a) Â Â Â It is possible that the condition of the brakes was as bad as Dr White says they were, or,

(b) Â Â Â The condition of the brakes were as Mr Ruller reported, that is, the front brakes were poorly adjusted.

Regardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a) If Dr White is correct, the truckâ€™s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b) If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.

Having considered all of the evidence, and the lengthy submissions of counsel, I will now consider the individual circumstances brought forward by the Crown and the two hypotheses contended for by the defence. What I say under each heading is somewhat of a summary but it is essentially the reasons for the view that I come to in respect of each.

I will also consider whether there is any other alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence.â€


	
	What her Honour here initially twice observed, when she began â€œ[t]he Court must find thatâ€, reflected the defence submissions. There was an issue as to whether Dr White or Mr Rullerâ€™s opinion about the state of the brakes would be accepted, which had to be resolved. It was the defence case that whichever opinion was accepted, the Crown could not exclude the possibility that poor adjustment had caused the accident.
	
	
	Her Honour appeared to accept this, when she went on to say that:
	


â€œRegardless of which finding I come to, were one, two or five brakes out of adjustment, the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the poor adjustment caused the accident because:

(a) Â Â Â If Dr White is correct, the truckâ€™s brakes, and therefore the truck, was not roadworthy; or,

(b) Â Â Â If Mr Ruller is correct, then as Dr Hart says that even one or two poorly adjusted brakes could make the truck more vulnerable to brake fade, and brake fade was the cause of the accident.â€


	
	If that is correct, the conclusion to which her Honour finally came, that the Crown had proven its case, was inconsistent with this finding.
	
	
	To understand how her Honour came to conclude that the Crown had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, it is best to record what her Honour then held in relation to the circumstances the Crown had advanced and the hypotheses the defence had raised. To that point the judgment did not clearly identify the matters over which the parties had joined issue. In the conclusions reached, there was no reference to matters which had been resolved in the cross-examination of Mr Ruller, as was apparent from her Honourâ€™s earlier summary of his and Dr Hartâ€™s evidence.
	
	
	The reasoning for some of the conclusions which her Honour reached by the summary method which she adopted, is difficult to follow. Some of the conclusions are affected by her Honourâ€™s erroneous approach to the expert evidence and some of her Honourâ€™s findings are contradictory. In the result, Mr Nisanâ€™s case that the reasons given are inadequate must be accepted.
	
	
	The trial judgeâ€™s conclusions were:
	


CIRCUMSTANCE ONE

2758106,R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 1325,"Judgment 

1The Crown applies to cross-examine Mr Maiava pursuant to s 38 Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that evidence he gave was unfavourable to the Crown and on the basis of a prior inconsistent statement. The particular evidence concerns whether Mr Maiava sought clarification from Andrew about what Andrew meant when he said he wanted Mr Maiava to find someone to do a job for him in respect of a witness. When the Crown asked Mr Maiava if Mr Maiava sought to clarify what Andrew meant Mr Maiava said that he did not. 

2The Crown pointed to what is contained in paragraph 7 of Mr Maiava's Statement of 13 October 2011 where Mr Maiava said that he told the Police: 

When we were doing these laps, Andrew said to me, ""Do you 
know anyone that will do a job?"" 

I said, ""What kind of a job?"" 

He said, ""Just a job"" 

I said, ""Oh yeah I know what you mean"" 

He said, ""I'll pay them 10 grand to make sure a witness doesn't get to court"" 

I understood that to mean, that he wants me to organise to get rid of the witness, as in kill him. I said to him, ""So you want me to get rid of him as in kill him?"" Andrew laughed in an evil way, which I took as an agreeance with my understanding of his request to kill a witness in his court case. 

3Mr Maiava's Statement then went on to say this: 

8. Andrew said to me, ""The witness I want to get rid of was a mate of mine who I asked to give me an alibi."" 

4The Crown submitted that Mr Maiava's oral evidence was unfavourable to the Crown because it did not go as far as what the Statement contained and, therefore, left the question of what precisely Andrew meant when he spoke to Mr Maiava about doing a job. 

5Mr O'Sullivan submitted that the evidence given by Mr Maiava was not unfavourable to the Crown. He submitted also that it was not inconsistent with what was contained in the Statement. 

6At the time the Crown first made the application the relevant question and answer of the witness was this: 

Q. Did you ever ask him, when you say you understood him to mean knock, did you ever ask him about that, if that's what he meant? 
A. No, I didn't. 

7That evidence was not inconsistent with what appeared in Mr Maiava's Statement because the Statement did not suggest that Mr Maiava had asked Andrew what he meant. Because there was no clear inconsistency that suggested that at that point the evidence was not unfavourable to the Crown. For that reason I said that I would not permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava, but would permit the Crown to seek to obtain from him in a non-leading fashion the evidence that was contained in paragraph 7 of his Statement. I said that if the Crown was unsuccessful in obtaining that evidence I would reconsider the question of cross-examination. 

8In the presence of the jury the following evidence was then given: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Q. Mr Maiava, you told us that Andrew Iskandar asked you to ""get rid of a witness"", I think were your words? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Were they the words that used 
A. Yes. 

Q. ""Get rid of""? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell him what you thought that meant, ""get rid of""? 
A. I just asked him what he said to me, you wanted to do a job, and that's all I asked him. 

Q. And you've told us what you understand ""do a job"" means? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell Andrew what you believed that meant? 
A. No. 

9At that point the Crown Prosecutor renewed her application to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

10In R v Pantoja [1998] NSWSC 565 James J (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) said: 

Although the heading to s 38 of the Evidence Act is ""unfavourable witnesses"", the section itself refers to ""evidence"" given by a witness and in my view leave can be granted to cross-examine a witness on part only of his evidence if it is unfavourable to the party calling him or inconsistent with a prior statement made by the witness, even though the rest or most of the rest of the witness's evidence is favourable to the party calling him. 

11Mr O'Sullivan accepted, in the light of the further attempts by the Crown to obtain the evidence in paragraph 7, that there was now a clear inconsistency between his oral evidence and the evidence in the Statement. I consider further, in the light of the relevant offence charged (solicit to murder) that the oral evidence of the witness was unfavourable to the Crown. A proper basis was therefore available under either paragraph (a) or (c) of s 38 to permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

12In giving the leave sought under this section regard is to be had amongst other things to the matters in s 192 Evidence Act . 

13In my opinion, the nature of the proceedings (a trial on a charge of soliciting to murder) and the importance of the evidence in relation to that charge make it appropriate to grant the leave sought. I do not consider that it would unfair to the Accused to permit that when the evidence was otherwise contained in the Statement signed by the witness. 

14The Crown is permitted to cross-examine in relation to paragraphs 7 and 8 of Mr Maiava's Statement.

2759185,R v Jarrett [2012] NSWCCA 81,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with Blanch J. 

2BLANCH J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision of his Honour Judge Black in the District Court at Lismore on 31 October 2011.

3The respondent appeared for trial on an indictment alleging that between 29 June 2007 and 1 July 2007 he committed two offences of indecent assault contrary to s61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 and two offences of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 contrary to s61J Crimes Act 1900.

4The Crown case was that the complainant, a 12 year old girl, stayed over at the home of her friend who was the daughter of the respondent. She said that her friend went to bed and the respondent then indecently assaulted her and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. There was some evidence of complaint to a girlfriend in 2007 and also to a boyfriend. The complainant was not interviewed by police until 29 January 2009.

5At trial the Crown sought to lead evidence of admissions made by the respondent to hospital staff and to Mr Greg Telford, an employee of the Department of Community Services, after he presented himself to the Emergency Department of Lismore Base Hospital.

6The first piece of evidence sought to be led was a statement from Dr Petroff, a consultant psychiatrist who identified a form filled in by him on 2 October 2007. That form noted a confession by the respondent that he "",... sexually abused his daughter's 13 year old friend some months ago..."" and noted the girl had abused him and he was terrified of going to gaol and was threatening to kill himself if discharged. The doctor ticked a box saying the respondent ""is a mentally disordered person"" and directed he be kept in casualty and treated.

7The second piece of evidence was a statement from Denis Casey, a clinical nurse at the hospital and he identified the medical notes he made relating to the respondent and said they accurately reflected what the respondent said to him. Those notes reveal the respondent was lying in bed sobbing and said he had ""interfered with a 13 year old girl."" The girl rang him and said she ""had had enough."" He was terrified she would tell someone and he would ""lose his kids and go to jail."" The nurse noted he was not mentally ill but acutely stressed.

8The third statement was from Dr Chris Donatsch who was the psychiatric registrar at the hospital at the relevant time. He identified hospital notes he made at the time and said they were true. Those notes begin ""Self presented to E Dept with suicidal ideation. Claims he had a sexual relationship with a 13 y.o. girl 2 months ago. Feels remorseful, terrified of consequences ..."".

9The fourth statement was from Greg Telford who was an employee of the Department of Community Services in 2007. He said that between 2 October and 10 October 2007 he was asked by the hospital to come and talk to the respondent. He went to the hospital and told the respondent:

""I know what you're here for. I have to tell you straight up that prior to talking to me, that should you mention the young girl's name, I am a mandatory reporter and I will have to notify the authorities.""

10The following exchange occurred between the witness and the respondent:

Respondent: ""Yeah that's ok"".
Witness: ""Is it true that you had sex with the young girl?""
Respondent: ""Yeah and I've got to admit I wasn't the first.""
Witness: ""Regardless she is still a minor.""
Respondent: ""I want to take responsibility for my behaviour.""

11After objection was taken to the admission of the evidence the trial judge refused to admit the evidence from these four witnesses because it would be unfair within the meaning of that term in s90 of the Evidence Act 1995. He gave as the reason for doing this that at the time the admissions were made Dr Petroff had diagnosed the respondent as mentally disordered and quoted the definition in s15 of the Mental Health Act 2007 as follows:

""A person, whether or not the person is suffering from mental illness, is a mentally disordered person if the person's behaviour for the time being, is so irrational as to justify a conclusion on reasonable grounds that temporary care, treatment or control of the person is necessary (a) for the person's own protection from serious physical harm; or (b) for the protection of others from serious physical harm.""

12The trial judge also noted that to admit the evidence might prolong any trial because of arguments as to how reliable the confessions were.

13Because this is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown must first establish that the rejection of the evidence ""...eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case."" Here the case against the respondent in the absence of the confessions was the evidence of the complainant and some evidence of complaint. The evidence of the confessions was undoubtedly the strongest part of the Crown case and the rejection of that evidence did substantially weaken the Crown case. In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWLR 228 at [37] Spigelman CJ said:

""Even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed, may still be 'substantially weakened' if evidence of cogency or force is withheld.""

14Here the Crown case in the absence of the admissions may or may not succeed and the Crown is entitled to challenge the rejection of the evidence. 

15The rejection of the evidence by the trial judge was based on s90 of the Evidence Act 1995 which allows the rejection of evidence. Section 90(b) states ""having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence."" In Em v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67; [2007] HCA 46 Gummow and Hayne JJ noted that while the section requires that regard be had to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it is the use of the evidence at the trial which is to be characterised as ""unfair"": at [107].

16Although the trial judge did not refer in his reasons for rejecting the evidence to the case of R v Medcalfe [2002] ACTSC 83 it was a case submitted to the judge as relevant because of the exercise of the power to reject confession evidence under s90 based on the mental state of the accused. That was a completely different case because the accused had earlier been found unfit to plead and there was psychiatric material detailing his mental condition. It was also a case where the confession was as a result of police questioning and the judge in the ACT Supreme Court formed the view as a result of the medical evidence the accused did not understand the caution and was giving answers he thought would please.

17In this case there was no evidence of the mental state of the respondent at the time of the admissions. A bare assertion that he was mentally disordered was not sufficient to conclude it would be unfair to admit the evidence. The doctor was not called to give evidence and it is plain from the hospital notes that the only basis for concluding the respondent was mentally disordered was his concern he might go to gaol as a result of committing the offences and was threatening to commit suicide.

18The onus of establishing unfairness under s90 lies on an accused as it did at common law, see Em v The Queen supra at [63]. Here that onus was not discharged. The admissions made were apparently spontaneous and the consideration that their admission might prolong a trial because of arguments about reliability was an irrelevant consideration.

19I propose:

(1)The Crown appeal be allowed.

(2)The order rejecting the confessions be set aside.

(3)The case be remitted to the District Court at Lismore for trial.

20HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Blanch J.

Â 

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

Â 

Criminal law â€” Evidence â€” Confessions â€”
Admissibility â€” Person in authority â€” Accused admitting crime to undercover
police officers â€” Whether undercover police officers â€œpersons in authorityâ€ â€”
Whether inculpatory statements properly admitted at trial without voir dire to
determine their voluntariness.

Â 








Criminal law â€” Evidence â€” Possible involvement of
third party in commission of offence â€” Accused charged with first degree murder
â€” Trial judge excluding evidence suggesting that victim might have been killed
by third party â€” Whether evidence should have been admitted â€” Whether
sufficient connection between third party and crime.

Â 

Significant circumstantial evidence linked the accused
to the murder of his aunt.Â  To obtain additional evidence against him, the
police began an undercover operation.Â  Several officers, posing as members of a
criminal organization, worked at winning the accusedâ€™s confidence.Â  To
encourage him to talk about the murder, they suggested that they could use
their corrupt police contacts to steer the murder investigation away from him.Â 
The accused eventually confessed his involvement in the murder.Â  At no time was
he aware of the true identities of the undercover officers.Â  After a jury
trial, the accused was convicted of first degree murder.Â  The trial judge ruled
that the accusedâ€™s inculpatory statements to the undercover officers were
admissible, holding that the undercover officers could not be persons in
authority and that no voir dire on voluntariness was necessary.Â  She
also ruled that evidence of the possibility that a third person might have
committed the murder should be excluded, finding that there was insufficient
evidence of a link between the third party and the murder.Â  A majority of the
Court of Appeal upheld the rulings and the accusedâ€™s conviction.

Â 

Held:Â Â The
appeal should be dismissed.

Â 








To ensure fairness and to guard against improper
coercion by the state, statements made out of court by an accused to a person
in authority are admissible only if the statements were voluntary. Â The
question of voluntariness is not relevant unless there is a threshold
determination that the confession was made to a â€œperson in authorityâ€.Â  A
â€œperson in authorityâ€ is generally someone engaged in the arrest, detention,
interrogation or prosecution of an accused.Â  Absent unusual circumstances, an
undercover officer is not usually viewed, from an accusedâ€™s perspective, as a
person in authority.Â  In this case, the accused failed to discharge the
evidentiary burden of showing that there was a valid issue for consideration,
namely, whether, when he made the confession, he believed that the person to
whom he made it was a person in authority.Â  The accused believed that the
undercover officers were criminals, not police officers, albeit criminals with
corrupt police contacts who could potentially influence the investigation
against him.Â  Where, as here, an accused confesses to an undercover officer he
thinks can influence his murder investigation by enlisting corrupt police
officers, the stateâ€™s coercive power is not engaged.Â  The statements,
therefore, were not made to a person in authority and a voir dire
on voluntariness was unnecessary. [34-45]

Â 








Evidence of the possible involvement of a third party in the commission
of an offence is admissible if it is relevant and probative.Â  The evidence is
relevant and probative if there is a sufficient connection between the third
party and the crime.Â  Here, the trial judge made no error in excluding from the
jury the theory that P might have killed the accusedâ€™s aunt.Â  With respect to
motive, Pâ€™s threats against the victim relating to drug dealings were not
sufficiently connected to the murder.Â  The threat incident took place over a
year before the murder and there was no evidence that P contacted the victim
after this incident.Â  In addition, the victim had stopped selling drugs eight
months before she was murdered. Â The other two possible
motives relied on by the defence were based on speculation, not evidence.Â 
On the issue of opportunity, while P was released from remand three days before
the victim was killed, this opportunity evidence, standing alone, is an
insufficient link between P and the murder.Â  Similarly, absent some connection
to the murder, the evidence of Pâ€™s bad character and propensity for violence is
inadmissible. [46-61]

Abella J. â€” The appellant,
Cory Grandinetti, was convicted of first degree murder following a jury trial.Â 
There are two issues arising out of the trial that form the basis of this
appeal.Â  The first is whether inculpatory statements made by the accused were
properly admitted without holding a voir dire to determine their
voluntariness.Â  The statements were made by the accused to undercover police
officers pretending to be members of a criminal organization.Â  The second is
whether evidence that a third party might have committed the murder should have
been admitted.Â  In my view, the trial judge did not err in connection with
either issue, and the appeal should be dismissed.

Â 

I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Background

Â 

2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Connie Grandinetti was Mr. Grandinettiâ€™s aunt.Â  She was found dead in a
ditch outside Fort Saskatchewan on April 10, 1997.Â  She had been shot twice in
the back of her head at close range.

Â 

3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Significant circumstantial evidence linked Cory Grandinetti to the
murder.Â  In July 1996, Connie Grandinetti hired a lawyer to enforce payment of
child support from her ex-husband Jeff Grandinetti, Cory Grandinettiâ€™s uncle.Â 
On January 15, 1997, her lawyer applied to the court for arrears of $12,000 and
ongoing child support of $1,000 per month.Â  Jeff and Connie Grandinetti were
unable to reach a settlement and the child support action was adjourned until
April 18, 1997, eight days after the murder.

Â 








4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
At the end of February 1997, Jeff Grandinetti asked a friend to lend him
$10,000.Â  He travelled from Edmonton to Calgary to pick up the cash.

Â 

5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Cory Grandinetti told his ex-girlfriend in March 1997 that his uncle
Jeff Grandinetti wanted Connie Grandinetti killed.Â  He also told her that his
uncle had obtained the money, and that he, Cory, planned to kill his aunt with
an overdose of heroin.

Â 

6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
On April 4, 1997, Cory Grandinetti travelled to Calgary.Â  He was
carrying two vials of heroin and a gun.Â  On the evening of April 9, 1997, he
borrowed his grandfatherâ€™s truck and said he was going to visit his Aunt Diane.Â 
Instead, he picked up Connie Grandinetti at approximately 8:00 p.m. in front of
her apartment building.Â  He is the last known person to see her alive.

Â 

7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
In July 1997, with few leads to investigate but suspicious that Cory
Grandinetti was involved, the RCMP began an undercover operation, Project
Kilometer, in an attempt to obtain additional evidence against him.Â  Several
police officers posed as members of a criminal organization and worked at
winning Cory Grandinettiâ€™s confidence.Â  Mr. Grandinetti thought the criminal
enterprise he was dealing with was a large international organization involved
in drug trafficking and money laundering.Â  He was led to believe that this
organization was moving to Calgary, that he had been chosen as its Calgary
contact, and that he could potentially make hundreds of thousands of dollars by
participating in the organizationâ€™s criminal activities.

Â 








8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
As part of Project Kilometer, the police engaged Mr. Grandinetti in
criminal activities, including money laundering, theft, receiving illegal
firearms, and selling drugs.Â  A number of police officers were involved in this
operation, including Constable Keith Pearce, known to the appellant as â€œMacâ€,
Corporal Gordon Rennick, known as â€œDanâ€, and Constable Robert Johnston, known
as â€œZeusâ€.Â  â€œMacâ€ posed as the head of the criminal organization.Â  At no time
was the appellant aware of the true identity of the undercover officers.

Â 

9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
From the beginning, the undercover officers encouraged Mr. Grandinetti
to talk about his auntâ€™s murder, but he consistently refused to do so.Â  By late
October, the undercover officers decided a new tactic was necessary.Â  They
began trying to convince the appellant that they had contacts in the police
department who were prepared to act unlawfully, and that they had been able to
use those contacts in the past to influence an investigation.Â  On October 30,
1997, the undercover officers convinced Mr. Grandinetti that they had managed
to have a murder charge against â€œDanâ€ reduced to aggravated assault by using
their police connections to relocate a witness and retrieve incriminating
photos.Â  They reinforced the perception that they had corrupt police contacts
on November 13, 1997, when â€œMacâ€ told Mr. Grandinetti that he had easily
learned the name of the investigator on the Connie Grandinetti murder
investigation.

Â 








10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
To further encourage Mr. Grandinetti to talk about Connie Grandinettiâ€™s
murder, the undercover officers suggested to him that they could use their
corrupt police contacts to steer the Connie Grandinetti murder investigation
away from him.Â  When he continued to balk at talking about the murder, they
told him that he might be a liability to their organization because of the
ongoing murder investigation.Â  They forcefully suggested he â€œcome cleanâ€ with
them to protect the organization from possible police interference.

Â 

11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
This led Mr. Grandinetti to confess his involvement in the murder,
provide details to the undercover officers, and take them to the location where
Connie Grandinetti was killed.Â  The confessions were recorded.Â  On the basis of
his confessions to the undercover officers, Mr. Grandinetti was arrested on
December 9, 1997.

Â 

12Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
At trial, Nash J. made two rulings that form the core of this appeal:Â 
first, she ruled that Mr. Grandinettiâ€™s inculpatory statements to the
undercover officers were admissible; and second, she excluded evidence of the
possibility that a third person might have committed the murder.

Â 

13Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The defence position at trial was that the undercover officers were
â€œpersons in authorityâ€ because Mr. Grandinetti believed they could influence
the investigation into the murder of his aunt through the corrupt police
officers they claimed to know.Â  This, the defence argued, shifted the burden to
the Crown to prove either that Mr. Grandinetti did not reasonably believe the
undercover officers were persons in authority, or that the statements were made
voluntarily.Â  The Crown, on the other hand, argued that the undercover officers
could not be persons in authority because the accused must believe that the
recipient of a confession can influence the investigation or prosecution by
aiding, not thwarting, the stateâ€™s interests.

Â 








14Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The trial judge held a voir dire to determine the threshold
issue, namely whether Mr. Grandinetti had met his evidentiary burden of showing
that there was a valid issue about whether the undercover officers were or
could be persons in authority.Â  For this purpose, the defence called three
witnesses:Â  Corporal Rennick, Constable Johnston, and Mr. Grandinetti.

Â 

15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The trial judge ruled that the undercover officers could not be persons
in authority, that no voir dire on voluntariness was necessary, and that
the statements were admissible.Â  She found that Mr. Grandinetti was totally
unaware of the true identity of the undercover officers, and, in fact, had a
collegial relationship with them.Â  She emphasized that the â€œperson in
authorityâ€ test is largely a subjective one, based on the reasonable beliefs of
the accused.Â  She concluded that logic and reason required that the definition
of â€œperson in authorityâ€ be limited to people the accused believes are acting
in collaboration with the authorities.Â  In her view, the undercover officers
could not be considered persons in authority because Mr. Grandinetti viewed
them not as acting for or in collaboration with the interests of the state, but
rather against those interests.

Â 

16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The second disputed ruling of the trial judge was her decision, after
two voir dires, to exclude defence evidence suggesting that Connie
Grandinetti may have been killed by a third party, Rick Papin.Â  The two voir
dires were held to assess the relevance and probative value of the
evidence.

Â 








17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
During the first voir dire, the defence tendered evidence of
threats made to Connie Grandinetti by Rick Papin.Â  The only witness was Dustin
Grandinetti, Connie Grandinettiâ€™s son.Â  He testified that his mother sold
cocaine from 1995 to 1996, but that she had stopped selling drugs by the spring
of 1996.Â  Ms. Grandinetti had once paid her son $100 to drive her to a location
where she sold cocaine.Â  Dustin Grandinetti testified that this incident was
the only personal knowledge he had of his motherâ€™s drug dealing.Â  Although he
had met Rick Papin once or twice, he never saw him deliver drugs to his mother.

Â 

18Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Most of Dustin Grandinettiâ€™s testimony consisted of hearsay statements.Â 
He testified that Connie Grandinetti told him she had stopped using Mr. Papin
as her drug supplier, and had begun selling drugs for someone else for less
than Mr. Papin charged.Â  She also told him that she became afraid of Mr. Papin
in early 1996.

Â 

19Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The second voir dire on this issue was much more extensive than
the first. The trial judge considered not only the testimony of those who gave
evidence on the voir dire, but also the evidence Cory Grandinetti gave
at trial.Â  In the presence of the jury, Mr. Grandinetti had testified that he
picked up his aunt at approximately 8:00Â p.m. on April 9, 1997, and that
she was looking for cocaine.Â  He said they went to several bars.Â  Ms.
Grandinetti went inside each bar for a few minutes while her nephew waited
outside.Â  Mr. Grandinetti and his aunt also went to a corner store, but left
after waiting for twenty minutes.Â  According to Mr. Grandinetti, his aunt was
looking for someone, but did not tell him who the person was.Â  Later, they
drove to a house where they talked.Â  Ms. Grandinetti told him about the
problems she had had in the last year with Rick Papin, who was both her former
lover and former cocaine supplier.Â  She told Mr. Grandinetti that when the
relationship ended, so did the cocaine sales.Â  She said that she felt she was
not allowed to sell cocaine for anyone else.Â  Mr. Grandinettiâ€™s evidence was
that he dropped Ms. Grandinetti off at a bar just after midnight.

Â 








20Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mr. Grandinetti testified on the voir dire as well.Â  He stated
that Connie Grandinetti told him that Rick Papin had beaten up some of her
customers, broken into her home, held a knife to her throat, and threatened to
kill her.Â  According to him, she had also indicated that she was gathering
information to expose Rick Papin as an informant, and that she was afraid of
Mr. Papin.

Â 

21Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Lawrence Berlinguette, Connie Grandinettiâ€™s boyfriend at the time of her
death, testified on the second voir dire that Mr. Papin, along with his
associate, Calvin Dominique, broke into their apartment on March 21, 1996.Â  Mr.
Dominique hit Mr. Berlinguette in the face and broke his nose.Â  Mr. Papin had a
hunting knife and put the blade to Connie Grandinettiâ€™s throat, ordering her to
stay away from his customers.Â  Mr. Papin also told Ms. Grandinetti that he did
not want her dealing drugs in town, and slapped her in the face a few times.Â 
Mr. Papin and Mr. Dominique claimed that Connie Grandinetti owed them money,
and accused her of informing on them to the police.Â  The incident lasted
approximately ten minutes.

Â 

22Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Calvin Dominique and Rick Papin were charged with several offences
arising out of this incident, but the Crown entered a stay of all proceedings
on November 26, 1996.Â  The day after the assault, Mr. Berlinguette and Ms.
Grandinetti moved from their apartment to the other side of theÂ  city.

Â 

23Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mr.Â  Berlinguetteâ€™s evidence was that although he and Connie Grandinetti
sold cocaine for Mr. Papin from February 8, 1996 until March 21, 1996, neither
of them had any contact with Mr. Papin or Mr. Dominique after March 21, 1996.Â 
He also stated that Ms. Grandinetti had stopped using and selling drugs eight
months before her death.








Â 

24Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Elaine McGilvery, Rick Papinâ€™s commonâ€‘law spouse from January 1995
until February 1996, also gave evidence on the second voir dire.Â  She
testified that during their relationship, Mr. Papin was involved in cocaine
trafficking and Connie Grandinetti was his runner.Â  In late February or early
March 1996, she said, Mr. Papin believed Connie Grandinetti had ripped him off
and informed on him to the police.Â  She was unaware of any contact between Ms.
Grandinetti and Mr. Papin after March 21, 1996, but by that point, her
relationship with Rick Papin had ended.Â  Ms. McGilvery also testified that
after the break-in, Connie Grandinetti told her she was afraid of Rick Papin.

Â 

25Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
According to Ms. McGilvery, Mr. Papin was physically and verbally
abusive to her.Â  He held a knife to her throat in February 1996, and threatened
to kill her a few times in 1996.Â  On January 18, 1997, he choked and threatened
her while she was in a bar because he was angry at her because he had hidden a
gun at her place and wanted it back.Â  Ms. McGilvery testified that she had no
personal knowledge that Mr. Papin carried a gun, and that she had never seen
him with a gun. Â She did, however, say that she found a gun in her residence
which she believed was placed there by Mr. Papin.Â  She reported the January 18
incident to the police, resulting in Mr. Papin being arrested and charged with
several offences, including assault. Â As a result of the charges arising from
the January 18 assault on Ms. McGilvery, and a separate charge of threatening
Ms. McGilvery, Mr. Papin was held in custody from January 18, 1997 until April
7, 1997.

Â 








26Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
During the summer of 1996, Ms. McGilvery became involved with Ricky
Whitford, who was in the Remand Centre with Mr. Papin from January to April
1997.Â  Ricky Whitford had known Mr. Papin since 1985.Â  Ms. McGilvery said she
told Mr. Whitford that Mr. Papin was a police informant, and that Mr. Whitford
wanted to expose Mr. Papin.

Â 

27Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mr. Whitfordâ€™s evidence on the second voir dire was that one to
two weeks before Connie Grandinettiâ€™s death, he told his cousin, Calvin
Dominique, that Connie Grandinetti could get information to establish that Mr. Papin
was a police informant. Mr. Whitford planned to show the documentation
establishing that Mr. Papin was an informant to everyone at the Remand Centre
in the hopes that Mr. Papin would be stabbed or beaten up.Â  He also said that
Ms. McGilvery told him that Ms. Grandinetti was afraid of Mr. Papin.

Â 

28Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mr. Whitford testified that although Mr. Papin used to assault people at
parties regularly, the last time he had seen him exhibit violent behaviour was
in 1993. He also said that he had seen Mr. Papin with a nineâ€‘millimetre
handgun and a .357 Smith and Wesson.

Â 

29Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mr. Whitfordâ€™s evidence was also that Mr. Papin was angry at Ms.
McGilvery and blamed her for his incarceration.

Â 

30Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Terry Garnett, the deputy director of security for the Edmonton Remand
Centre, testified on the voir dire that Rick Papin was detained from
January 18, 1997 to April 7, 1997 at the Remand Centre.Â  According to him, the
records showed that neither Mr. Dominique, Ms. McGilvery, nor Ms. Grandinetti
visited Mr. Papin while he was in custody.

Â 








31Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Constable Dennis Hartl, who also gave evidence on this voir dire,
arrested Connie Grandinetti on January 7, 1997 on a charge of selling cocaine
to an undercover police officer on March 1, 1996.Â  She was never formally
charged.Â  The sale was made on behalf of Rick Papin.Â  After her arrest, Ms.
Grandinetti provided information about a number of drug dealers, but she did
not provide any information about Mr. Papin.Â  She also told Constable Hartl
that she was not afraid of Mr. Papin and was willing to testify against him on
the break-and-enter charge arising from his 1996 assault in her apartment.

Â 

32Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The trial judge, after conducting the two voir dires, ruled that
there was insufficient evidence of a link between Rick Papin and the murder of
Connie Grandinetti, and excluded the evidence.

Â 

33Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The jury found Cory Grandinetti guilty of the murder of his aunt.Â  Mr.
Grandinetti appealed his conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal ((2003), 339
A.R. 52).Â  The majority (McFadyen and CÃ´tÃ© JJ.A.) upheld the rulings and
dismissed the appeal.Â  Conrad J.A. dissented, holding that it was possible to
conclude that the undercover police officers were persons in authority,
therefore necessitating a voluntariness voir dire, and that there was a
sufficient link between Rick Papin and Connie Grandinettiâ€™s murder to make the
evidence admissible.Â  The basis of this appeal is a challenge to the rulings of
the trial judge admitting the confessions and excluding the evidence that Rick
Papin might have committed the murder.

Â 

II.Â Â Â Â Â  Analysis

Â 

A.Â Â Â Â  The Admissibility of the Inculpatory
Statements








Â 

34Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The confessions rule ensures that statements made out of court by an
accused to a person in authority are admissible only if the statements were
voluntary. The relevant principles were canvassed by this Court in R. v.
Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, and R. v. Oickle, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3,
2000 SCC 38.Â  In Oickle, at paras. 47-71, the Court set out the factors
relevant to the voluntariness inquiry.Â  The issue argued on this appeal by the
appellant was whether the impugned statements were made to a â€œperson in
authorityâ€ within the meaning of Hodgson, and not whether they were free
and voluntary within the meaning of Oickle.

Â 

35Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
The rule, the policies supporting it, and the definition of â€œperson in
authorityâ€, were all considered in Hodgson.Â  Cory J. expressed the
ruleâ€™s rationale as follows:

Â 

The rule is based upon two fundamentally important
concepts: the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to
ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.

Â 

.Â .Â .

Â 

It cannot be forgotten that it is the nature of the authority exerted
by the state that might prompt an involuntary statement. .Â .Â . In
other words, it is the fear of reprisal or hope of leniency that persons in
authority may hold out and which is associated with their official status that
may render a statement involuntary.Â .Â .Â .Â  This limitation
[i.e., the person in authority requirement] is appropriate since most criminal
investigations are undertaken by the state, and it is then that an accused is
most vulnerable to state coercion. [paras. 48 and 24]

Â 








The underlying
rationale of the â€œperson in authorityâ€ analysis is to avoid the unfairness and
unreliability of admitting statements made when the accused believes himself or
herself to be under pressure from the uniquely coercive power of the state.Â  In
Hodgson, although explicitly invited to do so, the Court refused to
eliminate the requirement for a â€œperson in autho",27/1/2005 0:00,CA Supreme Court

REASONS FOR  DECISION 

! 

The  appellant Mrs. Meth sued  on her own  behalf and  on behalf of 

her youngest  chzld  to  recover dmages  as a  result of the  death of her 
husband who was  kllled m  a motor vehcle accident on 8 September 1972. 
Her c l a m  was hsmlssed.
--------
She  sued  three  defendants. 

The  flrst,  Graham  Sulllvan,  was 

jomed on  the  basls  that  he  was  t h e  drlver  of  the  motor  vehlcle  m 
w h c h  the  deceased  was  a passenger  when  A t  rolled  over on the  road 
from  Tennant  Creek t o   t h e   Warrego  m e .   The  learned  trlal 
lead- 

Judge  held  that  there  was  no  evldence  t h a t   Sh~lllvan was  the  drlver 
at the  relevant  tune;  there  was  no appeal  from  that  p a r t   of  the  judgnent. 

Robert  Shaun Hoore,  the  second  defendant  and  now  the  flrst 
respondent,  was  sued  as  the  owner of  t h e  motor  v e h c l e .   The case 
agmst h m  was  that  he  was  g u l l t y  of  neglzgence m  allowmg  the  vehxle 
t o  be driven when  he  h e w  or ought  t o  have  known  t h a t   it was  m  an unsafe 

c o n b t l o n  and  m  f a l u g  t o  w a r n   t h e   flrst defendant  or the  deceased 
t h a t   it was  m  an  unsafe  conktlon. 
reference  to  the  first  defendant  IS no  longer relevant.  There was 

For reasons  just  mentioned,  the 

vehcle was  bemg  drzven 
evldence  that  at the  tune  of  the  accldent  the 
by a man  hown  only  by h s  flrst name  and  who  later  hsappeared.  He 
. was  not  jomed  as  a  defendant. 
The  nommal  defendant 

(now  the  second  respondent)  was  jomed 

as t h r d  defendant,  on  the  basls  that  although  a pollcy  of  msurance 

complymg  wlth  the  provulons  of  the  Motor  Vehlcles  Insurance  Act  of 

Queensland  was  current  m  r e g a d   t o   the  v e h c l e  at  the  tune  of  the 
accldent,  the  vehlcle  was,  m  terns  of  the Motor  Vehlcles  Act  of  t h e  
On that  basls  and  pursuant  to  s.82 of 

Northern  Territory,  -sured. 

the Act  (now  repealed)  the nommal  defendant  was  sued  m  the  alternatlve. 

After  the  hearmg  of  the  appeal  had  begun  the  Court  was  t o l d  by 

two  respondents  that  no  b s t i n c t l o n  was  made  m  regard 
counsel  for  the 
t o   t h e u   p o s l t l o n s  and  that  lf the  appeal  were  allowed  there  should  â€˜be 
judgment  agamst  the nommal  defendant  only.  The  appellant  agreed  wlth 

t h s  approach.

 mspector 

and 

motor mechanic,  regardmg  the  conbtlon  of  the  vehlcle  and  the  llkely 

cause  of  the  accldent. 

H m  Honour's  conclusion  was  m  these  terms. 

V h e  reasonable  lnference  1 s   that  the  accldent  was 
caused  by  the  t a l  shaft  becommg  deteched  at  the

21 1, 

The learned trlal  Judge  held  that  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by 

the  owner  of  a motor  vehlcle  to  a g r a h t o u s  passenger  1 s   one  only  to 

w a r n   the  passenger  of  a  defect  m  the  vehlcle  h o w n   t o   t h e   e l v e r   b u t  

concealed  from the  passenger. 

As there was  no evldence  that  the  owner

*he  duty  of  care  after 

a  conslderatlon  of  varlous  authorltles  whch 

It 

1s necessary  for  thls  Court  to  renew. 

HIS Honour  went  on  t o   h o l d   t h a t  

there was  no  sufflclent  evulence  to  w a r r a n t   a  concluslon  that  the  owner 
ought  t o  have  h o w n   of  the  defect,  a  concluslon whlch  does not  appear 

t o  have  been  necessary  havmg  regard to  the  prmclple  he  thought 

applicable  and  a  concluslon  whch  he  &d  not  elaborate. 

In my opmlon  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  owner  of  a motor 

v e h c l e   t o   a passenger  1s not  that  propounded  by  h s  Honour. 

A  conslderatlon  of  the  relevant  authorltles  usually  begms  wlth 
h c t a  of  Goddard L.J.  m Haseldme v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son  Ltd.  (1941)  2  K.B.

(NSW)  249  at pp.256-257  as  no  such  authority. 

As  Jacobs  J.A.  pouted  out,  the  test  applled  by  the Privy  Councll 
was  whether  there was  any  endence  that  the  carnage  had  not  been  properly 

m a m t m e d   and  held  that  there  was  no  such  evidence. 

""he  p o m t   was 

slmply  whether  there  had  been  a  case  to  go t o   t h e   j u r y   and,  there  bemg 

evldence  t h a t   t h e   c a r n a g e   was  regularly exammed  by  a blacksrmth  every

I respectfully  adopt  that  analysls  of  Moffatt 

v.  Bateman  and  agree 

that  no  p r m c l p l e   can  be  drawn  from  It  that  the  owner  of  a v e h c l e  owes 

no  general  duty  of  care  to  a gratutous  passenger,  so  far as  concerns  t h e

Dolbel v.  Dolbel  and Hweldme  v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son  Ltd.,  referred  to

Asprey  J.A. 

took  a dLfferent  new. 

He accepted  what  was  s a d  by 

Goddard  L.J.  m Haseldlne  v.  C.A.  Daw  &  Son Ltd.  as  approved  111 

v.  Bateman 
Dolbel  v.  Dolbel,  noting  that  both  cases  treated  Moffatt 
as authorlty  for  the  proposltlon  that  m  the  case  of  a gratuitous 

passenger  the  duty  of  the  drlver 

or owner  1 s   confined  t o  w w g  of  a 

known  defect. 

Wdess v.  Plenmg was  reversed  on  appeal  (Plenmg  v.  Wvlless 

(1967-1968)  11  C.L.R.  @8),  but  on  grounds  not  relevant  to  the  present 
pmceedlngJ.  However,  m  the  course  of 

hls judgment,  Wlndeyer  J. 

referred  to  the  remarks  of  Jacobs 

J.A.  already mentioned  and commented 

that  although  the  matter  was  not  free  fmm  dzfflculty,  ""because  not  free 
from  author;Ltles,""  he  ""would  be  lnclmed  to  thlnk  that  a g r a h t o u s  

passenger  could  be  s m p l y  a  fnelghbourl as  Jacobs  J.A.  apparently  thought"" 

(at p.512).  Windeyer  J.  added. 

""I do not  doubt  t h a t   the man who  drlves  a motor 
vehmle  when  he  knows  t h a t   It  1s not  roadworthy

(at p.512). 
In my  vzew  there  1s no  authorlty  blndrng  upon  thls  Court  that 

holds  the  duty  of  the  owner  of  a motor  vehlcle  m motlon  t o  be  confmed

W l e  It may  be  loglcal,  if somewhat  unreal,  to  equate  a

that  anyone  drlvmg  the  vehacle  would  have  become  aware  of such a  defect.

""The  general  appearance  of  the  vehlcle  shows  neglect 
m  a l l  ways,  mechaucal  faults  found  could  have  been 
the  cause  of  the  actual  accldent"". 

A  mechazucal  f a u l t   was  held  t o  be  the  cause  of  the  accldent. 

Mr.  Moore  b d  not  e v e  evu3ence.  Mr.  Kmgston  was  asked  no 
questlons  about  the  conbtlon  o f   t h e   c a r ,   a t h e r   as  t o  the  tune  he 

owned  It or thereafter.  A  month  o r  so  after  the  accldent  he  took 
photographs  of  the  damaged  vehlcle  whlle  It was  m  the  pollce  yard  and 
those  photographs  were  tendered  m  evldence.  But  no  particular  use 
appears  t o  have  been  made  of  them  m  the  Supreme  Court  and  no p a r t ~ ~ l a r  
use  was  made  of  them  m  t h i s   Court. 

Both  m  exarmnation  m  d u e f   and  m  cross-ex-atlon  Mr.  Townsley 

of  t h e   v e h c l e   as 

w a s   asked  a  number of  questlons  abom  the  conhtlon 
observed by  him.  Much  of  that  evldence  related  to  the  conbtlon 
of  the 
drive  shaft,  wlth  a  descrzptlon  of  the  w a y  m  whxh  A t   IS  llnked t o  the 
gear  box  and t o  t h e   b f f e r e n t l a l ,   m  each  case  rnth  a unlversal  Jolnt. 
W. Townsley  spoke  of the need t o   grease  each  unlversal  j o m t ;   If t h s  1s 
not  done  lt 1 s   l l k e l y   t h a t   one  of  the  uuversal  j o m t s  wz11  glve way 
causmg  an end of the  tal shaft  t o   fall t o   t h e   ground.  As already 

trial  Judge held  that  thu was  the  cause  of tne 
mentioned,  the  learned 
accldent  and as  that  findug was  not  challenged,  It  1s unnecessary  t o  
spend  more tune  on t h s  aspect  of  the  car's  conbtlon.  Mr.  Townsley  b d  
say that  a  c o q e t e n t   s e r n c e   would  mclude  a  check  of the  mversal  j o l n t s ,  
and,  m  the  case  of  thuj v e h c l e ,   would  have  shown  them

tended  to  focus  on  the  lack  of  adequate  mmtenance  of  the  vehlcle  over  a

servlced o r  mspected  by  a  competent  mechanic.  A  person  who  buys  a motor

t o  allow  the  car  on  the  road  without  a

In  the  present  case  there  was  no  evidence  of  anythmg abnormal

Although  the  learned  trial  Judge  held  there  was  msufficzent

the  nature  of  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  first respondent  to  the

A g a m  it was  clearly  coloured  by  hls  Honour's  view  of  the  duty  of  care 

owed  by  the  owner  of  a motor  v e h x l e   t o  a  gratuitous  passenger,  a  vzew

    1 HIS HONOUR: Khaled Sharrouf, who I shall hereafter refer to as ""the accused"", was arrested on 8 November 2005. He was charged, I am informed, with an offence of conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. He has been in custody since that time. The accused and his alleged co-conspirators faced committal proceedings during the early part of 2007. He was, along with the others, committed to stand trial on 30 April 2007. On 31 May 2007 he and his co-accused were arraigned before me in the Supreme Court.  
     
      
    2 An indictment, signed by Paul Shaw for and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was presented on that day by the Crown Prosecutor. The charge in the indictment, leaving aside the particulars, was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œThe Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, charges in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 31 May 2007 that Omar Baladjam, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, Mohammed Omar Jamal, Mirsad Mulahalilovic, Khaled Sharrouf and Mazen Touma between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts."" 
        
       
      
    3 The charge arises from sections 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. To this charge the accused and the other men pleaded not guilty.  
     
      
    4 On the same day, the trial, including a range of contemplated pre-trial applications, was set down for hearing on 25 February 2008. The pre-trial procedures are to be completed so far as they possibly can be before a jury is empanelled. They began in fact on 25 February 2008 and have been continuing since that day. It is likely they will continue for some months.  
     
      
    5 Mr Brewer and Mr Michael Pickin appear for the accused Khaled Sharrouf. Mr Geoff Bellew SC appears for the Crown on the present application. Both the Crown and Mr Pickin have raised the issue of the accused's unfitness to be tried. Relevantly, a motion filed on behalf of the accused raising the issue was first notified to the Court in November 2007. It is agreed between the parties that this Court is exercising Federal jurisdiction, but that by virtue of sections 68(1) and 79 of the Judiciary Act (Commonwealth) a range of State laws relating to procedures for trial are, in general terms, to apply to the accused in connection with the offence with which he is charged. 
     
      
    6 It.Is also common ground between the parties that in relation to the narrow issue of determination of unfitness, the New South Wales legislation known as the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 governs the procedures to be followed.  
     
      
    7 There is, subject to one qualification I will mention later, no Commonwealth legislation dealing with the procedure to be adopted in this Court in determining an initial issue of fitness. Certainly there is no Commonwealth legislation governing the procedure to be followed in the present substantive application, although there is legislation governing the procedures subsequently to be adopted in the event that an accused person is to be found unfit (see sections 20B and following of the Crimes Act Commonwealth).  
     
      
    8 A preliminary issue has arisen. It is within a narrow compass. The essential question is whether the fitness hearing, as I shall for convenience call it, is to proceed before a judge and jury, or before a judge alone. The issue arises in the following circumstances: Prior to 1 January 2006 a fitness hearing was to be held with a jury, unless the accused made an election to have the issue determined by a judge alone. The legislation, as it operated prior to 1 January 2006, created on occasions significant problems for the legal representatives of an accused person where a fitness issue had arisen. How could the lawyers be satisfied they had operable and effective instructions from the client, when the fitness issue raised concerns about the fundamental ability of that client to understand and make decisions regarding issues in the proceedings generally?  
     
      
    9 The Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act 2005 altered the situation significantly. This legislation came into force on 1 January 2006. It inserted into the legislation by virtue of schedule 1(4) section 11(1) which is now in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ11(1) The question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the judge alone."" 
        
       
      
    10 Of course, the amending Act made other significant changes as well. It is not necessary to recite or refer to these, however, in relation to the narrow issue I have to determine. Those other changes may become relevant at a later stage if a finding of unfitness is made. It is important, however, to note that there was also enacted what might be described as a transitional provision. It was created by schedule 1(4). The provision is in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œAn amendment made by schedule 1(4)â€¦applies to proceedings for offences whether or not the offences were committed before, on or after the commencement of the amendment. It does not apply to proceedings commenced before the commencement of the amendment.â€ 
        
       
      
    11 The issue I have posed for determination will be answered by a consideration of two questions: First, what is meant by the word ""proceedings"" where it appears in the transitional provision? Secondly, depending on the answer to the first question, when were those proceedings relevantly commenced in the case of Mr Sharrouf?  
     
      
    12 The Crown has urged the court to find, first, that the term ""proceedings"" should be construed as meaning the proceedings which are currently before this Court; secondly, to find that such proceedings commenced when the indictment was first presented on 31 May 2007. It will follow, if these submissions are accepted, that the procedures in the new section 11 are to govern the fitness hearing.  
     
      
    13 Mr Pickin, on the other hand, urges the Court to find that the term ""proceedings"" is to be given a wider and less restricted meaning than that suggested by the Crown. Counsel submits the expression could and should embrace the initial charging of the accused by the police in November 2005. So construed, the proceedings would have commenced prior to 1 January 2006. Importantly, Mr Pickin submits that the section 11 amendment removes a traditional right to a determination of fitness by a jury of peers. Mr Pickin submits that, for this reason, the Court should be cautious in accepting the interpretation urged by the Crown. 
     
      
    14 In my view, the submissions of the Crown in relation to the preliminary issue are to be preferred. The first issue to be determined is the meaning of the term ""proceedings"" in the transitional provision. In turn, this provision directly relates to Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The application of Part 2 is stated in section 4 of the legislation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ 
        Application 
        
       
       
        
        4. This Part applies to criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court (including criminal proceedings within the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and criminal proceedings in the District Court.â€ 
        
       
      
    15 Secondly, section 5 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ 
        Person by whom question of unfitness may be raised 
        
       
       
        
        The question of as personâ€™s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the Court.â€ 
        
       
      
    16 The presence of the term ""proceedings"" in this section reinforces that the same term where it appears in the transitional provisions is a reference to criminal proceedings either in the Supreme Court or the District Court and to no other.  
     
      
    17 Further support for this construction is to be found in sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Act. The issue as to fitness may be raised before arraignment but, once again, the sections proceed on the basis that the issue will arises in the Supreme Court or District Court proceedings. Section 10 further reinforces the same conclusion.  
     
      
    18 In the course of his argument, Mr Pickin referred to the fact that committal proceedings are usually commenced by a court attendance notice, known as a CAN (section 47 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and that trial proceedings in the lower courts are commenced in those courts by the issue and filing of a CAN (ss 172 and 178 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986). This in each case is undoubtedly so. But essentially, for the reasons I have stated, the term ""proceedings"" in the transitional provisions is not apt to refer to proceedings of that type, but rather it is concerned with criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court and District Court.  
     
      
    19 Mr Pickin also referred to s 20B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. This section, the practical application of which neither counsel could vouch for nor recall, appears to confer power on a magistrate, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial, to refer the proceedings to a higher court to enable the issue of fitness to be considered. This is the qualification I mention earlier. The section appears in Part 1B Division 6 of the Commonwealth legislation. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œDivision 6-Unfitness to be tried. 
        
       
       
        
        20B Consequences of preliminary finding that person unfit to be tried. 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences, the question of the person's fitness to be tried in respect of the offence, is raised by the prosecution, the person or the person's legal representative, the magistrate must refer the proceedings to the court to which the proceedings would have been referred had the person been committed for trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the court to which the proceedings have been referred finds the person charged to be fit to be tried, the court must remit the proceedings to the magistrate and proceedings for the commitment must be continued as soon as practicable. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where a court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to which proceedings have been referred under subsection (1); or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) before which a person appears in proceedings for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences; finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie case that the person committed the offence concerned.â€ 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Three points may be observed. First, whether the section could ever have had any real or appropriate application in the present matter is not necessary to determine. The fact is that no application was ever made to the committing magistrate in this matter. Secondly, Mr Pickin does no more than suggest that the existence of the section should be thrown into the mix on the construction point. Thirdly, while I have given consideration to Mr Pickin's argument, I do not think the section has any bearing on the construction point, essentially for the reasons I have already expressed. In those circumstances I simply put the section to one side.  
     
      
    21 I turn now to consider the question as to when the criminal proceedings in this Court commenced. This in turn takes me to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and to s 130 of the same legislation. The former section defines ""criminal proceedings"" to mean:  
     
      
       
        
        â€œ(a) proceedings relating to the trial of a person before the Supreme Court or the District Court; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) proceedings relating to the sentencing of a person by the Supreme Court or the District Court; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) proceedings relating to an appeal under the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 
         2001 to the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction.â€ 
        
       
      
    22 The relevant part of the latter section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œ130(1) In this section, court means the Supreme Court or District Court; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the Court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury (and any orders) may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial."" 
        
       
      
    23 This section was considered by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Michael Taylor (2003) NSWCCA 194 and, more recently, in Regina v Janceski (2005) NSWCCA 281. 
     
      
    24 In the first of those cases a problem arose as to whether the new form of self-defence should go to the jury or whether the previous self-defence regime had application. This issue, in turn, depended on whether the Crimes Amendment Self-Defence Act 2001 applied to the trial or not.  
     
      
    25 The appellant, Mr Taylor, had been arraigned on 5 October 2001 on an indictment that charged him with murder. The appellant on that day entered a plea of not guilty and the trial was fixed for hearing and eventually commenced on 25 March 2002. The Crown Prosecutor presented a fresh indictment on that day. It contained the same charge as the earlier indictment, but it was differently dated and signed by a different Crown Prosecutor.  
     
      
    26 For some reason, the jury was discharged on that day and the proceedings were stood over to the following day, when again a new indictment was presented. It contained the same charge, but was dated a day later. It was signed by the same prosecutor who had signed the indictment the day before. 
     
      
    27 Between the date of the original arraignment and the trial date, the Crimes Amendment Self-Defence Act had come into force. There was a transitional provision, which provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œThis division applies to offences committed before or after the commencement of this division, except as provided by this section.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) This division does not apply to an offence if proceedings for the offence (other than committal proceedings) were instituted before the commencement of this division.""  
        
       
      
    28 So, the issue before the trial Judge (it was myself as it happened) was whether the proceedings for the offence had been instituted before 22 February 2002, the date when the new legislation came into force. The trial Judge found that the proceedings had been ""instituted"" on 5 October 2001.  
     
      
    29 The Court of Criminal Appeal (Bell J with whom Spigelman CJ and Miles AJ agreed) dismissed the appeal and, in particular, held that the trial Judge had been correct to hold that the new legislation had no application to the conduct of the trial. This was on the basis that the proceedings for the offence alleged against the appellant had been instituted prior to the date on which the new legislation commenced.  
     
      
    30 In the course of her judgment, Bell J addressed s 130(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. At para 150, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œIn any event, regardless of convenience, the indictment is the originating process in criminal proceedings in the District Court and the Supreme Court and once presented may only be amended or substituted in accordance with the provisions of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        .â€ 
        
       
      
    31 Later, at para 153, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œSection 130 confers jurisdiction on the court with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment.â€ 
        
       
      
    32 And again at para 154 her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œThe institution and conduct of proceedings on indictment in this Court is governed by the provisions of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         and the Common Law, to the extent the latter is not altered by the former. It seems to me the proceedings for the offence of the murder of Adam Scott were instituted in this Court on a date no later than 5 October 2002 when the appellant entered his plea upon his arraignment before Kirby J. It was then that the appellant was deemed to have put himself on the country for trial in respect of the charge that he had murdered Adam Scott."" 
        
       
      
    33 This decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal makes it clear, and this is reinforced by the language of s 130, that criminal proceedings in this Court are commenced as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned.  
     
      
    34 Mr Pickin sought to distinguish the situation in the present matter because the section under consideration in Taylor made express reference to ""proceedings (other than committal proceedings)"" being instituted before the commencement of the division. Mr Pickin submitted that, if the transitional provision in the present matter had included a reference to committal proceedings, there would be no arguable issue. However, he argued that the present reference is general and that the available construction is accordingly a broad one. 
     
      
    35 Now, it is true that the transitional section in Taylor was in a different form than the provision under consideration in the present preliminary question. I do not consider, however, that the distinction sought to be made by Mr Pickin is a valid one. First, the reference to ""committal proceedings"" in the legislation under consideration in Taylor was, in my opinion, really no more than a statement of the obvious. It did not otherwise impinge upon the correct interpretation of the issue as to when the relevant proceedings had commenced.  
     
      
    36 Secondly, the absence of a reference to ""committal proceedings"" in the present transitional provision does not, and indeed could not, in my opinion, take the argument any further. It is clear that criminal proceedings in this Court commence upon the presentation of an indictment and the arraignment of an accused. There was, in the present matter, simply no need for the legislature to refer to ""committal proceedings"".  
     
      
    37 In Janceski Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed)referred to section 130 in the following terms at para 41: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œEven prior to the enactment of section 130, the District Court's jurisdiction in a criminal matter only arose upon the presentation of an indictment. That rule is now enshrined in section 130, which was enacted to overcome any doubt about the Court's ability to make pretrial orders (see  
        Jago v District Court (NSW) 
         (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 36 to 37).""  
        
       
      
    38 There is, in that case, a valuable discussion by Howie J on the same point. At para 219 his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        â€œThe presentation of an indictment and the arraignment of the accused before the jury panel is a step in the proceedings that marks the commencement of the trial:  
        R v Nicolaidis 
         (1994) 33 NSWLR 362 at 367. But it serves no other purpose and I do not believe that it is a necessary step provided that there has previously been an indictment filed and provided that the accused has been arraigned on that indictment. The proceedings for trial on indictment commence upon the filing or presentation of a valid indictment. When the accused is first arraigned and pleads 'not guilty' he is 'taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial': Section 154 of the Act. Thereafter the Court has jurisdiction to make orders with respect to the conduct of the proceedings: Section 130(2) of the Act."" 
        
       
      
    39 There is also a helpful analysis by Howie J of the importance of an indictment in a criminal trial. This appears between paras 231 and 234. I have received considerable guidance from this analysis.  
     
      
    40 At para 232 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        â€œThe presentation of an indictment is therefore the most fundamental of the procedures that attend a criminal trial for an indictable offence. So far as the Courts in this State are concerned, there is neither any other procedural step necessary nor any alternative step available for the commencement of a criminal trial in the District or Supreme Court.""  
        
       
      
    41 These authorities make it perfectly clear that criminal proceedings in this Court against the accused commenced on 31 May 2007 and not at any earlier time. Consequently, the new section 11 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 will apply to the question of the accused's unfitness to be tried for the offence with which he is charged. This means that the question is to be determined by a judge alone and not by a judge and jury.  
     
      
    42 I direct that the Fitness hearing proceed before me on Tuesday 25 March 2008.

This appeal raises the important question whether, at common law, a court, when awarding damages for breach of contract or negligence, can include in its award damages, assessed by reference to appropriate interest rates, for the loss of the use of money which the plaintiff paid away and lost as a direct consequence of the defendant's breach of contract or negligence. There is the further question whether the presence of s. 30c of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                  SA (""the Act"") inhibits any development of common law principles which would favour an affirmative answer to the primary question. The appellants would be entitled to an award of interest under s. 30c in the absence of good cause shown. However, it has not been suggested that the relevant component of the damages awarded to the appellant could be accommodated within the ambit of the power conferred by the section: but cf. Wheeler v. Page

(1982) 31 S.A.S.R. 1, at p. 5.


               
The appellants, who are accountants, were the defendants in an action in the Supreme Court of South Australia brought by the respondents. The respondents carried on business under the name of Radio Electrix, selling, hiring and servicing television sets and other electronic goods. In 1982 the business was transferred to Walker Stores Pty. Ltd., that company having been incorporated to acquire and conduct thereafter the respondents' business. The appellants were engaged to prepare the partnership and individual income tax returns for the respondents for the years ended 30 June 1974 to 30 June 1981. The partnership paid the income tax of each partner out of its trading account and the amount was debited to the personal account of each partner in the books of the partnership.
               
In the partnership return for the year ended 30 June 1975 the appellants made an error in calculating the amount of depreciation allowable as a deduction. The error was carried through in the returns in succeeding years and it resulted in an overpayment of tax. Radio Electrix made provision in its books for depreciation of assets which exceeded that allowed for tax purposes. To calculate the firm's taxable income it was necessary to add to the profit shown on the firm's books the difference between the depreciation shown in the books and that allowed for taxation. The depreciation shown in the books was accumulated in a ""Provision for Depreciation"" account. In the first year for which the appellants prepared the returns the calculation of adding the difference back in was done correctly. In the second year the difference between the accumulated provision for depreciation as shown in the books and the accumulated provision for taxation as allowed for tax purposes was added back in. Consequently, the appellants' calculation of the respondents' taxable income was significantly greater than the correct amount and the respondents paid more tax than was necessary. This error was repeated each year until discovered by another accountant. The respondents were able to recover the overpaid tax for the years ending 30 June 1978, 1979 and 1980, and to amend the return for the year ending 30 June 1981, but the tax paid earlier was not recoverable as the right to recover was statute-barred.
               
The respondents sued the appellants for the loss of the amount of the income tax overpaid in the years ending 30 June 1975, 1976 and 1977, totalling $47,469.62, with compound interest at market rates upon that amount and upon the increased provisional tax which they were required to pay. As an alternative to the claims for interest, the respondents claimed damages at the trial for loss of the use of the money overpaid in these years by way of tax and paid by way of additional provisional tax. They alleged negligence and breach of contract. Bollen J. at first instance found the appellants liable for the negligent discharge of their obligations. He held that the respondents were not entitled, apart from s. 30c, to interest by way of damages. That section provides:
                     

                        
(1) Unless good cause is shown to the contrary, the court shall, upon the application of a party in favour of whom a judgment for the payment of damages, compensation or any other pecuniary amount has been, or is to be, pronounced, include in the judgment an award of interest in favour of the judgment creditor in accordance with the provisions of this section.

                        
                        
(2) The interest â€”
                              
(a) shall be calculated at such rate of interest as may be fixed by the court;

                              
                              
(b) shall be calculated â€”
                                    
(i) where the judgment is given upon an unliquidated claim â€” from the date of the commencement of the proceedings to the date of the judgment; or

                                    
                                    
(ii) where the judgment is given upon a liquidated claim â€” from the date upon which the liability to pay the amount of the claim fell due to the date of the judgment,

                                    
                                 
or in respect of such other period as may be fixed by the court; and

                              
                              
(c) shall be payable in respect of the whole or any part of the amount for which judgment is given in accordance with the determination of the court.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                        
(3) Where a party to any proceedings before the court is entitled to an award of interest under this section, the court may, in the exercise of its discretion, and without proceeding to calculate the interest to which that party may be entitled in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, award a lump sum in lieu of that interest.

                        
                        
(4) This section does not â€”
                              
(a) authorize the award of interest upon interest;

                              
                              
(ab) authorize the award of interest upon exemplary or punitive damages;

                              
                              
(b) apply in relation to any sum upon which interest is recoverable as of right by virtue of an agreement or otherwise;

                              
                              
(c) affect the damages recoverable upon the dishonour of a negotiable instrument;

                              
                              
(d) authorize the award of any interest otherwise than by consent upon any sum for which judgment is pronounced by consent; or

                              
                              
(e) limit the operation of any other enactment or rule of law providing for the award of interest.

                              
                           

                        


                        
                     

                  

               

               
Nevertheless, Bollen J. held the respondents could recover damages for the loss of the use of the overpaid amounts. In calculating those damages, he accepted ""that the [respondents] would have put most of the overpaid tax into the business"" and said:I think that had the [respondents] had the overpaid tax for their use at the times of overpayment and thereafter they could and would have used much of it to produce a profit which may fairly be assessed at 10 per cent on that money.He assessed the damages for the loss of the use of the money by reference to an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and then reduced the sum to account for the possibility that some of the money would not have been put back into the firm. Judgment against the appellants was subsequently entered as follows:

The provisions relating to Biar's and Whitbread's work related to the ascertainment of the extent of overpayment of tax and are not relevant for purposes of this appeal.
               
The respondents challenged that award of damages in the Full Court. King C.J., with whom Millhouse and Jacobs JJ. agreed, thought that damage resulting from the loss of the use of the money was ""within the reasonable contemplation of the parties within the meaning of the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale
                     
    [25]
  
                  "" and should be included in the damages award. His Honour accepted Bollen J.'s finding that the money would have been used to pay off the loans bearing the highest interest and that some of the money might have been used in the business in other ways. Given the fact that the business was profitable, King C.J. concluded that, to the extent that the respondents would have devoted the additional funds to the business, ""their loss could not be less than the rate of interest which they were paying on the [highest interest] loans"", this rate being 20 per cent and thus substantially higher than the 10 per cent used by Bollen J. in calculating the damage suffered through the loss of the use of the money. Accordingly, King C.J. concluded:[T]he loss occasioned by the overpayments of tax, assuming that all the additional money was devoted to the business, should be measured by compound interest at [the highest interest loan's] rate on the amounts overpaid for the period during which the appellants were deprived of their use. The loss arising from loss of use of the money on that basis to 30th November 1986 would amount to $334,521.64. The loss continued to run until the date of judgment, namely 26th February 1987.King C.J. reduced that amount on the basis that it could not be inferred that all of the money would have been used in the business. His Honour thought that some of it might have been used ""for nonbusiness purposes"". His Honour adjusted downward that figure and ""estimate[d] the loss arising from loss of use of the money by reason of the overpayments at $270,000"" on the footing that the appellants' knowledge of the partnership business and of the circumstances of the partners was such that it was within the reasonable contemplation of the appellants that the loss would result from the negligent preparation of the income tax returns in question. In the result the Full Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the appellants' cross-appeal.
               
The appellants appeal to this Court against, among other things, the award of damages for the loss of the use of money assessed by reference to an annual compound interest rate of 20 per cent. The respondents seek to cross-appeal against the ruling that some of the overpaid amounts would not have been used in the business and the consequential reduction in the award of damages for the loss of the use of money. It is convenient to begin with the appellants' contentions and then to turn to the cross-appeal.
               
Before us Mr. Bennett Q.C., for the appellants, submitted that, where a purely financial loss is inflicted, damages caused by the consequential unavailability of money should not be awarded. This, he asserted, is the first time that a court has awarded damages for loss of use of money caused by a negligently inflicted loss of money. Mr. Bennett also argued that, because the legislature has intervened by enacting s. 30c, interest should not be awarded otherwise than in accordance with that provision.
               
It is certainly true to say that the common law hitherto has turned its face against awarding interest as compensation for the late payment of damages. It has been considered that the decision of the House of Lords in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.
                  
    [26]
   necessarily denied the entitlement of a plaintiff to such an award. What is meant by the expression ""late payment of damages"" in this context and whether the respondents' claim for loss of the use of money in this case is for the late payment of damages are central questions for decision.


[1893] A.C. 429.


               
This is not the occasion to trace the tortuous path by which the common law of England arrived at the position that interest will not be awarded for the late payment of damages: see Tehno-Impex v. Gebr. Van Weelde
                  
    [1]
  . However, it is necessary to mention, if only very briefly, the common law attitude towards interest before Lord Tenterden's Act 1833 
                  UK made statutory provision for the award of interest in some cases. In mediaeval times religious hostility to usury meant that the law gave little encouragement to the recovery of interest directly or by way of damages for late payment. As late as 1807 the reporter of De Havilland v. Bowerbank
                  
    [2]
   commented:It would fortunately be a very difficult matter to fix upon another point of English law, on which the authorities are so little in harmony with each other.
               



[1981] Q.B. 648, at pp. 660 et seq.
(1807) 1 Camp. 50, at p. 52 [170 E.R. 872, at p. 873].


               
Lord Tenterden's decision in Page v. Newman
                  
    [3]
   confirmed the traditional rule that a creditor was not entitled to interest, in the absence of agreement, when the borrower failed to repay money lent on the due date. Lord Tenterden C.J. said
    [4]
   it would be ""productive of great inconvenience"" if a rule were adopted that ""interest is due wherever the debt has been wrongfully withheld after the plaintiff has endeavoured to obtain payment of it"" because ""it might frequently be made a question at Nisi Prius whether proper means had been used to obtain payment of the debt, and such as the party ought to have used"". His Lordship referred to ""the long-established rule"" against awards of interest in such cases.

(1829) 9 B & C., at p. 381 [109 E.R., at p. 141].


               

                  Page v. Newman led to the enactment of Lord Tenterden's Act in 1833. Sections 28 and 29 of that Act qualified the common law by granting the court a discretion to award interest on ""debts or sums certain"" in certain torts and in claims upon policies of insurance.
               
It was against this background that the House of Lords decided in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. that the plaintiff could not recover an award of interest on a provisional amount payable under an agreement because there was no debt or sum certain payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time within the meaning of s. 28 of the Act of 1833. Their Lordships also decided that the plaintiff could not recover interest by way of damages for detention of the debt, the law on that subject, unsatisfactory though it was, having been too long settled to permit of departure. Although Lord Herschell L.C. considered that the ground assigned in Page v. Newman was not ""a satisfactory reason for excluding altogether any claim to interest by way of damages in cases where justice requires that it should be awarded"", he thought that the course of authority and the fact of limited legislative intervention precluded judicial review of the common law
    [5]
  . His Lordship reached this conclusion reluctantly because he thought that the rule should be:when money is owing from one party to another and that other is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order to recover the amount due to him, the party who is wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought not in justice to benefit by having that money in his possession and enjoying the use of it, when the money ought to be in the possession of the other party who is entitled to its use
    [6]
  .The decision stands for the proposition that in England, at common law, in the absence of any agreement or statutory provision for the payment of interest, a court has no power to award interest, simple or compound, as compensation for the late payment of a debt: President of India v. La Pintada Compania Navigacion S.A.
                  
    [7]
  . For a long time the decision was regarded as applying to any form of damages, including special as well as general damages.

The same view with respect to the late payment of damages was expressed in this country by Latham C.J. in his dissenting judgment in Marine Board of Launceston v. Minister for the Navy
                  
    [8]
  . His Honour said:When an action is brought for damages for breach of contract or for tort, the amount of damages is never increased (apart from some statutory provision, e.g., Lord Tenterden's Act) because there has been delay caused by negotiation and litigation or by other circumstances. The loss of the use of the money ultimately awarded as damages is not part of the loss occasioned by the tort or breach of contract itself. It is a loss due entirely to delay in the payment of money ultimately held to be due, and is not recoverable as part of the damages.See also Starke J.
    [9]
  . The majority did not address the point.

Very recently in an action for damages for negligence in failing to take reasonable care in dealing with the plaintiff's request for the arrangement of insurance cover for its ship, this Court rejected a claim by the plaintiff to include in the damages award a sum representing the loss it had suffered by being deprived of the insurance moneys since 1975:Norwest Refrigeration Services Pty. Ltd. v. Bain Dawes (W.A.) Pty. Ltd.
                  
    [10]
  . Gibbs C.J., Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ. said
    [11]
  :It [the plaintiff] argues that if the Sonoma had been covered effectively under the fleet policy then it would either have received the sum insured from the insurer in 1975 or if it became necessary to sue the insurer it would probably have received the sum insured plus interest on that sum pursuant to s. 33 of the Supreme Court Act 1935 
                     WA. On this basis, Norwest claims that the interest is an integral part of the damages themselves. It is not merely a case of seeking interest on a sum assessed as the damages flowing from a tort. In our opinion, however it be put, the argument cannot succeed. At common law, no court could award interest in a case such as this, whether by way of interest on damages or as damages: London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co.

In 1987 the House of Lords expressed a view similar to that taken by Latham C.J. In President of India v. Lips Maritime Corpn
                  
    [14]
   Lord Brandon of Oakbrook said:There is no such thing as a cause of action in damages for late payment of damages. The only remedy which the law affords for delay in paying damages is the discretionary award of interest pursuant to statute.It followed, in the opinion of their Lordships, that the umpire in that case was wrong when he added to the owner's claim for liquidated damages for demurrage a further damages component, though he was right to award interest (but not compound interest) on the amount of demurrage payable by the charterer as from a date being two months from the completion of discharge. Critical to the decision was the conclusion that ""a claim for demurrage sounds in damages rather than in debt""
                  
    [15]
  , even though the claim is for liquidated damages. The point is that there is a due date for payment of a debt, but no such date in the case of damages. And the parties had by their contract quantified the damages which were payable in the event of breach.

At this distance in time it seems somewhat surprising that the argument in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. made no reference to the principles enunciated in Hadley v. Baxendale governing the recovery of damages for breach of contract. The explanation no doubt lies in what in 1893 was thought to be the paramountcy of the rules relating to the recovery of interest, so that the recovery of interest stood apart from the general principles governing damages. And we need to recall that until well into the present century the common law set its face against the recovery of pure economic loss in tort. Indeed, Liesbosch, Dredger v. S.S. Edison (Owners)
                  
    [16]
   held that impecuniosity giving rise to financial loss was a separate and concurrent cause and too remote from the tort. Loss or damage due to late payment of a debt was not seen as recoverable by way of damages. Such loss or damage was regarded as too remote.

It was not until 1952 that it was recognized that loss due to the late payment of a debt or damages might be recoverable in accordance with Hadley v. Baxendale. It was then acknowledged that loss of this kind might constitute special damage within the contemplation of the parties under the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale. In Trans Trust S.P.R.L. v. Danubian Trading Co. Ltd.
                  
    [17]
   the Court of Appeal recognized that a failure to pay money would give rise to an entitlement to damages for breach of contract if a special loss was foreseeable at the time of the contract as the consequence of non-payment. Denning L.J. asserted
    [18]
   that the ground on which the law refused interest for late payment of a debt or damages was that interest was ""
                     ""generally presumed not to be within the contemplation of the parties"": see Bullen & Leake, 3rd ed., at p. 51""
                  
    [18]
  . Denning L.J. went on to say: ""That is, I think, the only real ground on which damages can be refused for non-payment of money. It is because the consequences are as a rule too remote.""

Subsequently in Wadsworth v. Lydall
                  
    [19]
   the Court of Appeal, applying what had been said in Trans Trust S.P.R.L., held that a plaintiff was entitled to recover as special damages the loss suffered by him as the result of the failure of the defendant to pay a sum of Â£10,000 due to him under a contract, the circumstances being that the defendant ought to have known that the plaintiff would need to acquire another farm or smallholding, using the Â£10,000 payable under the contract for the purpose, and that if the Â£10,000 was not paid the plaintiff would be compelled to incur expense in arranging alternative finance and paying interest. The Court of Appeal distinguished London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. on the ground that it was concerned with the first, but not the second, limb in Hadley v. Baxendale. Brightman L.J. said
    [20]
   of the action in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.:The action was an action for an account. The House was concerned only with a claim for interest by way of general damages. If a plaintiff pleads and can prove that he has suffered special damage as a result of the defendant's failure to perform his obligation under a contract, and such damage is not too remote on the principle of Hadley v. Baxendale
                     
    [21]
  , I can see no logical reason why such special damage should be irrecoverable merely because the obligation on which the defendant defaulted was an obligation to pay money and not some other type of obligation.

In La Pintada
                  
    [22]
   the House of Lords approved Wadsworth v. Lydall and the distinction drawn by Brightman L.J. between that case and London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. The House of Lords, though acknowledging the injustices caused by the old common law rule as confirmed by its 1893 decision, concluded that it could not depart from that decision. This was because Parliament had chosen to remedy some of those injustices in certain circumstances and because the rule had been judicially qualified by limiting its application to claims for general, as opposed to special, damages
    [23]
  .


[1985] A.C., at p. 127.
[1985] A.C., at pp. 129-131.


               
In confining the authority of its earlier decision, the House of Lords opened the way to a logical and principled development of the law of damages on the topic now under consideration. The means by which this initiative was achieved â€” asserting that the 1893 decision was concerned only with the first limb in Hadley v. Baxendale
                  
    [24]
   â€” enabled the House of Lords to escape from the rigours of stare decisis. London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co.
                  
    [25]
   does not confront us quite so starkly, but Norwest Refrigeration
                  
    [26]
   presents a similar problem, with which we shall deal in due course.


(1854) 9 Ex. 341; [156 E.R. 145].
[1893] A.C. 429.
(1984) 157 C.L.R. 149.


               
However, for the moment, it is necessary to examine the distinction made by the House of Lords along with the consequence that the distinction entails. In the first place, the distinction is a gloss on London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. which proceeded on the broad footing that interest by way of damages was too remote, without discriminating between the refinements of Hadley v. Baxendale of which no mention was made. Secondly, and more importantly, the circumstances which are now held to attract the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale â€” take, for example, those in Wadsworth v. Lydall â€” are very often circumstances which in any event would attract the first limb. If a plaintiff sustains loss or damage in relation to money which he has paid out or forgone, why is he not entitled to recover damages for loss of the use of money when the loss or damage sustained was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the relevant breach of contract or tort? After all, that is the fundamental rule governing the recovery of damages, according to the first limb in Hadley v. Baxendale Ltd. (see Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Industries Ltd.
                  
    [27]
  ) and, subject to proximity, in negligence. The object of the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale was to include loss arising from special circumstances of which the defendant had actual knowledge when that loss does not fall within the first limb because it does not arise from ""the ordinary course of things"" of which the defendant has imputed knowledge: see Victoria Laundry
                  
    [27]
  . To allow a plaintiff to recover special, but not general, damages, is illogical, subverts the second limb in Hadley v. Baxendale from its intended purpose and introduces a new element into the general measure of damages for negligence.


[1949] 2 K.B. 528, at p. 539.
[1949] 2 K.B. 528, at p. 539.


               
If the distinction between the two limbs is to be rigorously applied in claims for damages for loss of the use of money, a plaintiff who actually incurs the expense of interest on borrowed money to replace money paid away or withheld from him will be entitled to recover that cost, so long as the defendant was aware of the special circumstances, but not otherwise. The expense must fall within the second limb of Hadley v. Baxendale in order to be compensable. It cannot fall within the first limb because the defendant cannot be fixed with imputed knowledge of the plaintiff's financial situation and of his need to incur expense by borrowing money. Furthermore, a plaintiff who is not compelled to borrow money by way of replacement of money paid away or withheld will not be entitled to recover for the opportunity lost to him, i.e., lost opportunity to invest or to maintain an investment. This is because in the ordinary course of things the defendant appreciates that the plaintiff will replace from his other resources the money lost, so that opportunity cost falls more readily within the first limb of Hadley v. Baxendale. How can this difference in treatment be justified? In each case the plaintiff sustains a loss and, ex hypothesi, the defendant's wrongful act or omission is the effective cause of that loss, at least if we put Liesbosch, Dredger
                  
    [28]
   to one side.


[1933] A.C. 449.


               
In Canada it seems that a plaintiff is entitled to recover interest charges actually incurred on money borrowed on the defendant's default or if the plaintiff owes money to anyone equal to the amount of the claim and is paying interest on it: Waddams, Law of Damages (1983), Â§833; and see Atlantic Salvage Ltd. v. City of Halifax
                  
    [29]
   where the plaintiff's claim for interest succeeded on the ground that it had been indebted to its bank for a sum exceeding the amount of the claim throughout the period. But it has been acknowledged that it is anomalous to allow interest only to a plaintiff who has an overdraft: Municipal Spraying & Contracting Ltd. v. J. Harris & Sons Ltd.
                  
    [30]
  . If a justification exists for the difference in treatment, it must have its genesis in a policy that encourages recovery of expense actually incurred and discourages or denies recovery of opportunity cost. Yet it is not easy to see any cogent reason for the adoption of such a policy; the award of compensation for opportunity cost would not expose the courts to insuperable problems in fact-finding.

2863564,R v Droudis (No. 10) [2016] NSWSC 1305,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has tendered seven photographs of Man Monis (MFI36). Objection is taken to the tender of the photographs essentially upon the basis that there is an insufficient nexus between these photographs and the Accused, Amirah Droudis.
	
	
	At the outset, it is acknowledged for the Accused that these photographs form part of a number of items of evidence that were the subject of a ruling which I made on 12 August 2016, admitting evidence on a number of bases, including motive, relationship, state of mind and for tendency purposes.
	
	
	A particular objection, however, is directed to these items which, it is said, ought not be admitted for other reasons relating to the suggested insufficient nexus with the Accused.
	
	
	The evidence on the voir dire indicates that the photographs were taken on 31 July 2014, using a Sony mobile phone, which was seized from the Accused on 15 December 2014, when she was located in a Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle.
	
	
	The photographs were discovered on an M-TECH USB located at the Belmore address of the Accused's family on 16 December 2014.
	
	
	There is evidence on the voir dire that the headband which is being worn by Monis, contains Arabic script which states ""We are your soldiers Mohammed, May Allah honour him and grant him peace"".
	
	
	The photographs were taken in premises at Wiley Park which were occupied by Monis and the Accused in 2014.
	
	
	The photographs depict Monis apparently seated. In a number of the photographs, he is posing with his hands folded, sitting in front of a bookcase. The images depicted in the photographs are inconsistent with them being so-called â€œselfiesâ€ where he himself would have been holding the mobile phone.
	
	
	The defence submission is that it is quite possible that Monis took these photographs himself, using a timer in the mobile phone, so that the Accused herself was not connected with the taking of the photographs.
	
	
	The Crown submits that these photographs are one piece of evidence in a circumstantial case involving many pieces.
	
	
	The question at this point is one of admissibility. It is the case that the Accused is not depicted in the photographs, nor is there direct evidence that she took them. There are, however, a number of factors which may provide a foundation for such a conclusion, bearing in mind that all I am considering at this stage is the admissibility of the evidence, and not what conclusions might be reached with respect to it.
	
	
	As I have said, the photographs were recovered on her mobile phone. The M-TECH USB stick was located in the Belmore premises in December 2014. The photographs were taken in premises which were occupied by the Accused and Monis at the relevant time in 2014.
	
	
	In my view, there is a sufficient nexus, for the purpose of admissibility, between the Accused and the photographs. What conclusions can be reached by reference to the photographs will be an issue to be considered in light of the totality of the evidence in the Crown's circumstantial case.
	
	
	I am satisfied, however, that these photographs (MFI36) ought be admitted and I so rule.

6267875,SafeWork NSW v Tolputt [2017] NSWDC 285,"Judgment

The charge and the plea


	
	Jeremi Scott Tolputt, the defendant, is charged with a breach of sÂ 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act) in that on 1 June 2015 at 73 Cape Three Points Road, Avoca Beach (the property), he failed to comply with a duty under s 28(b). The duty was owed to several persons, being Benjamin Martin, Jessie Powell, James Amson, Adam Hanscombe, Blake Currie and Michael Bell. The defendant has pleaded guilty.
	


The legislation


	
	Section 28(b) provides:
	


While at work, a worker must:

â€¦

(b)Â Â Â take reasonable care that his or her acts or omissions do not Â Â Â adversely affect the health and safety of other persons â€¦


	
	The defendant was a worker within the meaning of the section.
	
	
	Section 32 relevantly provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:

(a)Â Â Â the person has a health and safety duty, and

(b)Â Â Â the person fails to comply with that duty, and

(c)Â Â Â the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.


	
	The maximum penalty applicable in this case is $150,000. I pause here to note that Mr Docking, who appeared for the prosecutor, drew my attention to the fact that s 32 provides for two categories where an offence is committed by an individual. One category provides for the maximum penalty of $150,000, the other provides for a maximum penalty of $300,000. He further drew my attention to different interpretations and whether truly the category of offence imposing the maximum penalty of $300,000 was appropriate. It tended to become something of an academic point in light of his instruction that this was a $150,000 case and not a $300,000 case. In any event, I have satisfied myself with the fact that it is a $150,000 case, by reason of the way the amended summons is pleaded. The $300,000 category requires that the offence be committed by an individual as a person conducting a business or undertaking or as an officer of a person conducting a business or undertaking. It may have been the fact that the defendant was carrying on a business or undertaking. If that was so, it was not pleaded as such. At least that is the way I read the amended summons.
	


The evidence


	
	The prosecutor tendered an agreed sentencing bundle of documents (Exhibit PX 1). Also tendered were extracts from records of interview that had been conducted with Mr Bradshaw, Mr Hanscombe and Mr Jessie Powell.
	
	
	The defendant relied on two affidavits of himself. One was sworn on 29 August 2017 and the other on 31 August 2017. The former related to his financial position. The latter put forward evidence in mitigation.
	
	
	The defendant also tendered an extract from a record of interview with Mr Martin. He also relied on what might be called character evidence. In that regard, there was a reference from Mr Gesling and there were affidavits from Julie Edwards, Benjamin Ward and Graeme Baker.
	
	
	The defendant was present throughout the proceedings and he gave evidence and was cross-examined.
	


Facts


	
	The parties provided an Agreed Statement of Facts which I summarise.
	
	
	The defendant, at all material times, was a self-employed tree-climbing contractor who performed tree and rope access work including for persons conducting a business or undertaking. He was a qualified Level 3 Arborist, and had been in the tree industry for a long time and was very skilled. He had before 1 June 2015 completed numerous jobs for Bradshaw Tree Services Pty Ltd (BTS). On 1 June 2015, he was contracted by BTS to remove a tree.
	
	
	In April 2015, the Central Coast was hit by a severe storm. The result was a tree fell onto a house on the property. The tree was a 17m bark tree. Most of its foliage and branches were directly overhanging the roofline. The property was a steep block, sloping away from the road. Access to the property was limited.
	
	
	BTS was contracted to inspect the fallen tree and remove it. Mr Bradshaw, the sole director of BTS, conducted his inspection on 27 May 2015 and completed a â€œBTS Safety Analysisâ€. He contemplated in that analysis â€œa process that the surrounding trees were to be used as lowering points to swing sections of the canopy that were over the roof and then lower them to the ground at the rear of the house. The process involved using an experienced climber with a team of labourers to drag branches and parts of the tree from the bottom of the back yard to the top of the property safely with the wood chipper to be used lastâ€.
	
	
	Mr Bradshaw arranged for the following people to attend the property and remove the tree:
	



	
	The defendant was contracted as a specialist climber to access and dismantle the tree;
	
	
	Mr Jessie Powell (a BTS worker), to operate the chainsaws to cut felled section of the tree into smaller pieces for removal from the property;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell of IMS as Site Supervisor. IMS was a labour hire organisation;
	
	
	Mr Ashley Powell to provide five ground workers from IMS to drag branches and small sections from the rear of the property to the road. The labour hire workers included:
	



	
	Benjamin Martin;
	
	
	James Amson;
	
	
	Michael Bell;
	
	
	Adam Hanscombe; and
	
	
	Blake Currie.
	



	
	On 1 June 2015, Ashley Powell went to see Mr Bradshaw at 6:00am and picked up ropes integral to the work method outlined in the BTS Safety Analysis, and a harness and other equipment, to take to the property. The harness supplied was a tree harness, not a fall arrest harness which would have been necessary for roof work. The ropes were to assist in supporting the damaged tree during dismantling and the harness was to be used by a worker to access the roof to clean it of branches and debris following the tree removal. Mr Bradshaw also provided a copy of the BTS Safety Analysis to Ashley Powell.
	
	
	Ashley Powell headed towards the property, but following a telephone call, diverted to attend a school to resolve a public safety issue.
	
	
	Jessie Powell and the defendant arrived at the property. The defendant had spoken with Mr Bradshaw about the method to be used, but at the property he did not believe it would work. He did not contact Mr Bradshaw to speak to him about that. He did not wait for Mr Powell to arrive. Instead, the defendant decided that the only way to take down the tree would be to climb the roof to go up inside the tree, find the highest point and bring small pieces down on the roof. The pieces were then to be chopped up by the labourers in the backyard and dragged out by hand.
	
	
	Other workers arrived at the site. Jessie Powell spoke with Ashley Powell who informed him that he would be late. Ashley Powell had the BTS Safety Analysis with him and no other worker had seen it. Ashley Powell did not provide any direction that work not start until he arrived.
	
	
	Work commenced. The defendant was in the tree. Other workers assisted him with lowering parts of the tree. A saw was brought up to the roof. The defendant, Jessie Powell and all five labour hire workers were then on the roof.
	
	
	Ropes were used with a pulley system. A load would be tied around that rope then lowered using the rope and pulley. The load would swing slowly as it was lowered.
	
	
	When a branch was coming down, the defendant would stop cutting. Once lowered, Jessie Powell would cut the load into smaller pieces which were then thrown off the roof.
	
	
	At around 9:00am, the smaller branches had all been removed and thrown to the ground below.
	
	
	The defendant rigged the rope to cut a more substantial branch section that was to be lowered. When the cut was completed, the section of approximately one metre in length and 30 to 40 centimetres in diameter fell and swung at an angle out towards the edge of the roof. The defendant told the workers that this load was going to swing and they needed to move as they were in the flight path of the cut section and that this load could knock them all off the roof. They all moved out of the way where they believed it was going to swing.
	
	
	Whilst the section was being lowered using the rope, Mr Amson did not expect it to swing as hard as it did and the section hit Mr Amsonâ€™s left shoulder. The section then swung across to hit Mr Martin who walked from behind Mr Amson and towards the swinging section. The force of the strike knocked Mr Martin off balance. He stumbled and rolled towards the edge of the roof. Mr Amson brought down the section as quickly as possible, jumped towards Mr Martin and was able to grab Mr Martinâ€™s ankle. Mr Martin went over the edge and Mr Amson could not continue to hold him. Mr Martin grabbed the gutter at the roof edge which came off the roof fascia. Mr Martin fell approximately 11 metres to the ground below. He fell directly into the mass of loose foliage and small branches that had collected to a depth of 1.5 metres on the ground thus cushioning his fall.
	
	
	As a result of the incident, Mr Martin sustained a fractured shoulder and required physiotherapy. He also suffered from minor flashbacks and had difficulty sleeping.
	
	
	Had the defendant contacted Mr Bradshaw when he formed a view that the job could not be done as planned, or had he waited for Mr Ashley Powell to arrive, the job would not have been done in the manner it was.
	


The risk


	
	There was a risk to the workers of death or serious injury from:
	



	
	being hit by parts of the fallen tree that were being felled, dropped or lowered from their position during the removal of the tree;
	
	
	falling approximately 11 metres from the roof to the ground below at the property.
	


Codes of practice


	
	There were codes of practice in place at the time of the incident. They included:
	



	
	the â€œCode of Practice for the Amenity Tree Industryâ€ of August 1998 (the Tree Code); and
	
	
	the â€œManaging the Risk of Falls at Workplace Code of Practiceâ€ of January 2012 (the Falls Code).
	



	
	The Tree Code notes that tree work is hazardous and that each year many people are killed or injured in the tree industry.
	
	
	The Falls Code dealt with falls in a workplace generally. There was a risk of fall within the meaning of the Code.
	
	
	The work being undertaken at the property was a high risk storm damage job.
	
	
	The defendant failed to take reasonable care that his acts or omissions did not adversely affect the health and safety of other persons in contravention of s28(b) of the Act. One particular is expressed as: failing to â€œafter inspecting the site not commencing and undertaking tree felling, dropping or lowering work that required workers to be on the roofâ€. That is acknowledged to be somewhat inelegantly worded. The intent is clear enough. It is that the defendantâ€™s work method required workers to be on the roof after he had inspected the site.
	
	
	The defendant was the most experienced and competent person at the property. He should have refused to do the job after inspecting the tree and the surrounding trees. He has acknowledged as much in his affidavit.
	
	
	Further particulars are also somewhat inelegantly expressed. They may be, however, defined as follows.
	


(b)Â Â Â Mr Tolputt undertook the task without:


	
	consulting Mr Bradshaw as to an alternative to the plan they had earlier discussed;
	
	
	ensuring that no more than two workers were on the roof;
	
	
	ensuring that anyone on the roof used travel restraint equipment to prevent free fall.
	



	
	The Falls Code provides that persons other than a person conducting a business or undertaking may also have a responsibility for health and safety. The same message is set out in another code being the Work Health and Safety Consultation, Co-operation and Co-ordination Code of Practice of New South Wales of December 2011 (the Safety Consultation Code). The Safety Consultation Code provides, in effect, for cooperation and coordination between duty holders responsible for the same task.
	
	
	I note at this point that Mr Bradshaw and the defendant had coordinated and cooperated, but the defendant departed from the plan that had been set by Mr Bradshaw and agreed to by the defendant and did so without coordination and cooperation with Mr Bradshaw.
	
	
	The Falls Code requires that workers exposed to risk of fall should be adequately supervised, have received training and instruction in relation to the work and use fall control measures.
	
	
	At the time, WorkCover had a publication as to â€œVulnerable Workersâ€. Basically, they are those who are young or lacking in experience. Messrs Martin, Hanscombe, Currie and Jessie Powell were clearly vulnerable workers. They were all young. Though 34 years old, Mr Amsom may also be classified as a vulnerable worker.
	
	
	The job should not have started without the workers having travel restraint systems.
	
	
	Safe systems for minimising risks of falls were available. Such systems are provided for in The Falls Code, the SafeWork Code and the National Code of Practice for the Prevention of Falls in Housing Construction of SafeWork Australia of April 2010.
	
	
	Approximately one week after the incident, the defendant and Ashley Powell attended the site to complete the removal of the tree. One worker assisted the defendant on the roof. The defendant and the worker on the roof wore harnesses. Two ropes were tied off the front of the house and the top of the roof with secure anchor points to harness the workers in case they fell. Branches were lowered either directly onto the ground or onto the roof and then the ground. The defendant provided this extra safety equipment for the worker because it was not provided by BTS. On this occasion, the defendant provided this extra equipment to guard against any recurring incident.
	


The sentencing process


	
	I bear in mind several matters. I bear in mind the purposes of sentencing as enumerated in sÂ 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I bear in mind the purposes of the work health and safety legislation, in particular ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers and others on workplace premises. I bear in mind any relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including any mentioned in sÂ 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so far as any of those may be relevant.
	
	
	I start my analysis with a consideration of the gravity of the offence. This may be determined in part by the foreseeability of the risk of injury, the foreseeability of the consequences of the risk coming home and the measures available to avoid the risk.
	
	
	Foreseeability in this case was plain and needs no explanation. This is at two levels. First, risk of injury from swinging timber and from fall from roof were clearly foreseeable. Secondly, the potential consequences of those risks coming home were clearly foreseeable and that included potential fatal injury.
	
	
	Measures were readily available to eliminate the risk in this case.
	
	
	Paragraph 5 of the Amended Summons sets out the measures the prosecutor relies on in this case. The defendant accepts that the measures relied on by the prosecutor were readily available and I have already referred to them. In short, they are not proceeding with the task after inspecting the site, consulting with Mr Bradshaw about an alternative method, ensuring the use of travel restraint systems. Further, there was the measure adopted to undertake the task after the incident and already referred to.
	
	
	General deterrence needs to be considered and allowed for in the penalty. The Court of Appeal has stressed the importance of this in Bulga Underground Operations v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37. Those operating in the industry must understand that safety is paramount and failure to comply with safety requirements will have consequences. As the Tree Code notes, tree work is hazardous and many people in the industry are killed or injured each year.
	
	
	Specific deterrence must also be factored in. The defendant does not do tree work of the kind he was doing at the time of this incident. He still, however, operates in a risky industry with considerable work at heights. I accept the defendantâ€™s evidence and that of others that he is a very safety conscious person and more so since in the incident.
	
	
	There are aggravating factors that may be taken into account. There are two matters. One is the injuries to Mr Martin may be described as substantial â€“ Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(g). The other is the offence included a grave risk of death â€“ s 21A(2)(ib).
	
	
	There is a number of factors to be taken into account on behalf of the defendant. He has no prior conviction related to health and safety matters. That has to be seen in the context of operating in the industry for a long time.
	
	
	The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	The affidavits that I have mentioned attest to the defendant being a person of good character. I pause to note that on many occasions he has volunteered his time and work in the cause and assistance of others. I accept his evidence as to the effect this incident has had upon him and his ready recognition from the outset that the task should not have been undertaken the way it was.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he is unlikely to reoffend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	There is some evidence that is somewhat confusing, particularly as to his attempts to contact Mr Bradshaw or anybody from Mr Bradshawâ€™s business before undertaking the task. I am satisfied, however, that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has done so more or less from the outset.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty and is entitled to consideration for that. The benefit of a plea of guilty lies essentially in its utilitarian value and, accordingly, normally, the earlier the plea, the greater the value. The plea of guilty was entered practically immediately upon the settling of the amended summons. It was fairly evident from his first interview that this was likely to be a plea. I think in the circumstances, he is entitled to the full benefit of an early plea.
	
	
	The prosecutor has acknowledged frankly that there has been considerable assistance from the defendant and from his lawyers in the course of the investigations and the prosecution of these proceedings.
	
	
	The defendant led financial evidence seeking to call in aid s 6 of Fines Act 1996. The prosecutor frankly acknowledges that the evidence is sufficient for the discharge of the defendantâ€™s onus in this regard. I bear in mind the defendantâ€™s state of indebtedness, his limited resources, his uncertainty of work, his ongoing business financial commitments, his family situation of non-working wife and five children with another due shortly and also his liability for the costs of these proceedings which the prosecutor estimates could be about $24,000.
	
	
	All these mitigating matters lead to a result that will be less of a fine than would otherwise be imposed in the circumstances. In all the circumstances, including the allowance for the discount for the plea of guilty, I think the appropriate penalty is the sum of $20,000.
	


ORDERS


	
	The defendant is convicted and fined the sum of $20,000 with a moiety to the prosecutor.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutorâ€™s costs as may be agreed or assessed.
